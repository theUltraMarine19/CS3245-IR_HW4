2768018,R v Thieu [2015] NSWDC 236,"Judgment


	
	By an indictment presented on 20 October 2015, the accused, Tien Thieu, is charged contrary to section 302.3(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) with one count of trafficking a marketable quantity of a controlled drug, namely 449.3 g of pure paramethoxymethamphetamine (also known as PMMA) in a total admixture of nearly 1 kg of white crystalline powder.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that the accused, and his brother Van Son Thieu (who I will refer to in these reasons as VS Thieu), were associates of a Melbourne based drug-trafficking principal named Suky Lieu. Suky Lieu's trafficking enterprise involved numerous other persons, located in Melbourne, Sydney and also in Hong Kong.
	
	
	Through telephone and other contact with his Hong Kong contacts, principally an individual referred to in the transcripts of intercept material only as ""John"", Suky Lieu was able to obtain access to various types of controlled drugs that were available from time to time in Sydney and make arrangements for their subsequent transportation from Sydney to Melbourne. The Crown alleges that Suky Lieu and John used a particular modus operandi or method to further their enterprise. When John had drugs available in Sydney and they were required by Suky Lieu in Melbourne, Suky Lieu and John would arrange for one or more of Suky Lieu's Melbourne associates to travel to Sydney in order to meet with one or more of John's Sydney associates, whereby the drugs would be collected and then transported back to Melbourne for intended further distribution or sale by, or on behalf of Suky Lieu.
	
	
	The charge against the accused concerns one instance of alleged trafficking in controlled drugs undertaken by Suky Lieu using the above-mentioned modus operandi. In particular it is alleged that the accused, and his brother, VS Thieu:
	


travelled from Melbourne to Sydney at the direction of Suky Lieu in order to receive a quantity of drugs that were intended for further sale and distribution through Suky Lieu's trafficking enterprise; and

met in the vicinity of Bankstown with associates of John; and

collected a bag containing approximately 1 kg of white crystalline powder, which upon analysis was found to contain 449.3 g of pure PMMA.


	
	The Crown alleges that the accused trafficked the illicit drug by transporting and/or guarding the substance. It is alleged that in doing so he knew, or was at least reckless to the fact, that the substance was some type of controlled drug. It is also alleged that he intended that at least some of the substance was intended for future sale by a person.
	
	
	The Crown case against the accused is circumstantial. The evidence sought to be adduced in respect of the incident the subject of the charge is principally in the form of telephone intercepts and physical surveillance evidence.
	
	
	In proof of the charge, the Crown also seeks to adduce evidence of other facts, circumstances and events. A large part of this additional evidence is also in the form of telephone intercepts and physical surveillance evidence. Some of it concerns other alleged instances of trafficking by Suky Lieu and some of it concerns alleged, indeed admitted, instances of trafficking on the part of the accused. In respect of the latter, the accused has already served a sentence imposed upon him by the County Court in Victoria.
	
	
	The Crown relies upon this additional evidence in proof of the charge against the accused on the basis that it is relevant and admissible evidence as either circumstantial evidence or, at least in respect of the evidence of the Victorian offences, tendency evidence. That latter evidence is the subject of a tendency notice dated 19 October 2015, which amended in largely insubstantial respects a notice dated 6 April 2015. No objection is taken to the effect that the period of notice is unreasonable.
	
	
	The accused objects to the admission of any evidence concerning other instances of alleged trafficking, either by Suky Lieu or the accused himself and objects to the tender of any intercept material that does not involve the participation of the accused.
	
	
	The objections to the tender are put on a number of bases. Those objections can be broadly summarized in the following way. First, it is submitted that the evidence is not relevant and is therefore inadmissible. Second, insofar as the evidence may be relevant and prima facie admissible as non­tendency circumstantial evidence, it is submitted that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused and therefore it must be excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. Third, in respect of the evidence relied upon for a tendency purpose, it is submitted that it ought not be admitted on the bases either that it does not have significant probative value (as required by s 97 of the Evidence Act) or, alternatively, the probative value of the evidence does not substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect (in accordance with the balance prescribed by s 101 of the Evidence Act). Finally, as I understand the submission, it is submitted that all the intercept material is inadmissible on the basis that it is hearsay.
	
	
	For the purposes of argument on the voir-dire the Crown prepared a Crown Case Statement of some 190 closely typed pages. It provides, among other things, a comprehensive recitation of the material outlining the “uncharged” facts, events and circumstances the Crown seeks to rely upon as circumstantial evidence in proof of facts in issue on trial of the accused on the sole count on the indictment.
	
	
	The Crown categorized the evidence sought to be relied upon at trial by reference to particular periods of time, and events, described in the following way:
	
	
	The first period concerns a trafficking incident on 6 and 7 April 2012;
	
	
	The second period relates to an uncompleted attempted trafficking between 13 and 23 June 2012;
	
	
	The third period, concerns the charged trafficking transaction and relates to the period 24 June to 2 July 2012;
	
	
	The fourth period covers the dates 2 July to 11 September 2012 and relates to certain events and communication subsequent to the arrest and charging of the accused and his co-accused;
	
	
	Finally, the fifth period relates to the time between 29 October 2012 and 27 June 2013 and concerns subsequent admitted trafficking by the accused whilst on bail.
	
	
	I did not understand there to be any particular issue as to the division of the material in that way. The controversy, for present purposes, concerns the admissibility of the material which each of those categories represents. The third period, if I have correctly understood the submissions put on behalf of the accused, is subject only to the hearsay objection.
	
	
	In very broad summary, the first period, the 6-7 April trafficking period involved the following matters. Initially, Suky Lieu made arrangements for an associate to travel from Melbourne to Sydney in order to receive methamphetamine from one of John's Sydney associates. Suky Lieu had initially sought that the accused’s brother, VS Thieu and/or another man, Minh Phuoc Nguyen Huynh, carry out this task. As VS Thieu was ultimately unable or unwilling to travel to Sydney, Suky Lieu used Huynh, to travel to Sydney to collect the drugs. Using a vehicle borrowed from Suky Lieu, Huynh, accompanied by his wife and children, drove from Melbourne to Sydney to a house at Eastwood, NSW, where Huynh collected the drugs from an associate of John. On the return trip home police intercepted the vehicle near Broadford, Victoria. Police searched the vehicle and found a child’s backpack in the rear of the vehicle, which contained 6 silver coloured packages, each containing a crystalline substance. Subsequent testing confirmed the substance to be a total of 4.4718kg of pure methamphetamine. Huynh was arrested and charged. Following the interception and arrest of Huynh, Suky Lieu attempted to find out what had happened with his courier and asked VS Thieu to do various things to find out what had occurred. VS Thieu eventually confirmed that Huynh had been caught by police.
	
	
	The second period, the uncompleted trafficking in June 2012 can be broadly summarized in the following way. Suky Lieu and John discussed the details of the interception and arrest of Huynh in April and arranged for the further supply and collection of drugs in Sydney. At Suky Lieu's direction, VS Thieu travelled to Sydney and checked into a motel to await the handover of the drugs. After waiting for a time, the proposed handover did not eventuate and VS Thieu returned to Melbourne. Whilst VS Thieu was in Sydney, the accused communicated with VS Thieu concerning the making of arrangements for VS Thieu's return to Sydney and also communicated with Suky Lieu about various things relating to VS Thieu’s presence in Sydney and about picking up money from one of Lieu's other associates.
	
	
	In summary, the trafficking alleged in the indictment, which is the subject of the third period referred to above, involved the following sequence of events, on the Crown case.
	
	
	Suky Lieu and John arranged for the further supply and collection of drugs in Sydney. At Suky Lieu's direction VS Thieu and his brother, were to fly from Melbourne to Sydney, and to make arrangements to meet with John's associate, Hoang Phuong Vu Le (who I will refer to simply as Le), and collect the drugs from him. Initially, VS Thieu arranged with Le to meet on 1 July 2012. The accused and VS Thieu were both booked to travel to Sydney by plane on that date, however they missed their flight and were unable to obtain another that day. VS Thieu communicated this circumstance to Le. The accused communicated that circumstance to Suky Lieu. Following discussions with Suky Lieu, VS Thieu arranged to meet with Le in Sydney on 2 July 2012. The accused and VS Thieu travelled to Sydney by plane on that date. When they arrived in Sydney on 2 July 2012, VS Thieu rented a hire car to be driven by the accused and the accused then drove them to Bankstown. Once there, VS Thieu initially met with Le at the ""Pho An"" restaurant whilst the accused remained in the hire car. Arrangements were then made for VS Thieu and Le to each to return to Bankstown later that day for the completion of the intended transaction. In the interim, VS Thieu was in contact with another man, Jamie Harris (Harris), and they arranged to meet in Burwood. After the initial meeting between Le and VS Thieu, the accused and VS Thieu drove to Burwood, picked up Harris and then returned to Bankstown. They parked in a multi-storey carpark near the Bankstown Sports Club. While waiting for Le to return to complete the handover of the drugs, the accused, VS Thieu and Harris went together to a restaurant and then to the Bankstown Sports Club.
	
	
	Le subsequently contacted VS Thieu and the pair arranged for the handover of the drugs to occur in the multi-storey carpark. Le arrived at the carpark in his own vehicle, from which he removed a red, blue and white striped bag. VS Thieu left the other two at the club and met Le in the stairwell of the multi-storey carpark. He took possession of that bag from Le and placed it in the rear of the hire car. Immediately thereafter, the accused and Harris left the Bankstown Sports Club and returned to the carpark. All three got back into the hire car, with the accused as driver, VS Thieu as front passenger and Harris as rear passenger. Police intercepted the vehicle on a suburban street in Bankstown not long after it had left the carpark. Police searched the car and found the red, blue and white bag inside Harris' backpack on the backseat. The accused, VS Thieu and Harris were arrested and charged. The red, blue and white bag contained approximately 1 kg of a white crystalline substance, which was later analysed and found to contain 449.3 g of pure PMMA.
	
	
	The fourth period, involving events immediately following the charging of the accused and his co-accused, is broadly summarized in the following way.
	
	
	After the interception and arrest of the accused, VS Thieu and Harris, Suky Lieu and John again sought to find out what had happened with the supply and collection of the drugs. Suky Lieu and John engaged in numerous coded telephone conversations in which they discussed what had happened and speculated about the cause of the interception and arrest of their associates (and the fact that Le was not arrested). They also continued to discuss future arrangements for trafficking. On 18 July police executed a search warrant at 13 Albatross Avenue, Hinchinbrook, being the residence of John's associate, Anh Thai Pham. The residence was used as a safe house for storage of illegal drugs. Le had attended the residence in the past and had communicated with Pham in order to arrange for the collection of the drugs that were supplied during the 2 July trafficking incident. Police located controlled drugs and other drug trafficking paraphernalia at the residence. On 27 July 2012 police executed a search warrant at 5/79-81 Cambridge Street, Canley Heights and also over a vehicle that had been driven by Le on 2 July 2012. Le was present at the time and was arrested. Police located a sim card that had previously been used to make contact with Pham.
	
	
	As to the final period, involving subsequent trafficking by the accused in the period late October 2012 to June 2013, intercepted telecommunications between the accused and other persons, including Suky Lieu, demonstrate that after being released on bail for the charged trafficking incident, the accused engaged in trafficking of heroin and ice or other amphetamines in Melbourne. The accused pleaded guilty, was sentenced by the County Court of Victoria in relation to that offending conduct and has since served his sentence.
	
	
	The elements of the offence charged on the indictment, that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt are as follows.
	
	
	First, that the accused trafficked in a substance. The Physical Element is conduct, informed by the definition of “traffics” in s 302.1. The Fault Element is Intention.
	
	
	Second, the substance seized is a ""controlled drug"". The Physical Element in this respect is Circumstance. The Fault Element is relevantly Recklessness.
	
	
	Third, that the quantity of the controlled drug was a ""marketable quantity"" The Physical Element is again Circumstance, the Fault Element is Absolute Liability.
	
	
	According to the applicable definition, a person ""traffics"" a substance if the person either transports the substance with the intention of selling any of it or believing that another person intends to sell any of it or guards or conceals it with the intention of selling it or assisting another person to sell any of it. Where the amount of the substance exceeds the prescribed ""trafficable quantity"", there is a (rebuttable) presumption that the accused had the necessary intention or belief concerning the sale of the substance.
	
	
	It appears that the, or certainly one of the, critical issues at trial will concern the accused’s state of mind at the relevant time. The elements of the offence reveal two critical aspects to the requisite state of mind, which the Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt. Relevantly, they are, first, whether he ""knew'' (or more aptly was reckless as to the fact) that the backpack located in the hire car contained a substance that was a controlled drug and, second, whether he intended to transport, guard or conceal the substance with a view to it later being sold by him or some other person.
	
	
	The accused was spoken to by police at the time of his arrest and also later took part in a recorded interview. During the post arrest conversation with police and in his interview the accused effectively denied any knowledge of the drugs that were found in the backpack and also claimed that he had only come to Sydney with his brother for a visit.
	
	
	In broad terms, the Crown contends that the contested evidence it seeks to adduce is relevant and admissible as non-tendency circumstantial evidence. In that respect it relies in particular upon the decision of the High Court in Harriman v R (1989) 167 CLR 590 and a line of cases that follow from it, including R v Quach (2002) 137 A Crim R 345, in particular at [8] in the judgment of the then Chief Justice.
	
	
	In particular, the Crown submits that the evidence demonstrates the following five matters.
	
	
	First, that Suky Lieu was a person engaged in the business of ongoing illicit drug trafficking activity, including coordinating trafficking of illicit drugs from Sydney to Melbourne.
	
	
	Second, the nature of the relationship between the accused and Suky Lieu, in particular as a person participating in Suky Lieu's unlawful business activities.
	
	
	Third, the nature of VS Thieu's relationship with Suky Lieu, that is, also as a person participating in Suky Lieu's unlawful business activities.
	
	
	Fourth, the awareness on the part of the accused of the nature of VS Thieu's relationship with Suky Lieu, as a person participating in Suky Lieu's unlawful business activities.
	
	
	Fifth, the context in which the accused and VS Thieu travelled to Sydney on 2 July 2012.
	
	
	The Crown also submits that the contested evidence rebuts any assertion by the accused of innocent involvement in the activities of Suky Lieu (and of his brother, VS Thieu), in particular on 2 July 2012.
	
	
	By reference to the authorities on which it relies, the Crown properly accepts that questions of admissibility must ultimately be determined by an analysis of the relevance of the evidence to facts in issue in the trial, rather than by characterisations such as ""relationship evidence"" or ""contextual background"".
	
	
	The Crown contends that in each instance, that is in respect of each of the five time periods identified, the evidence is relevant to the central issues that the Crown must prove in the trial. The Crown identifies those issues as: first, whether the accused was reckless as to the fact that the backpack found in the car contained a substance that was a controlled drug; secondly, whether the accused (acting in concert with VS Thieu and both at the direction of Suky Lieu) intended to traffic that substance; and, finally, whether the accused intended (or believed) that any of that substance would be later sold by himself or another person.
	
	
	The Crown argues that the evidence is circumstantially capable of proving each of those three things because it demonstrates the following twelve matters.
	
	
	First, that Suky Lieu was a principal/co-ordinator of illegal drug trafficking between Melbourne and Sydney- and the 2 July 2012 transaction occurred as part of his illegal drug trafficking business.
	
	
	Second, that John was a principal/co-ordinator of the supply of illegal drugs to Suky Lieu in Sydney- and the 2 July 2012 transaction occurred as part of his illegal drug supply business.
	
	
	Third, that Suky Lieu and John had an established modus operandi for the supply/handover and collection/transportation of drugs and together they co-ordinated the 2 July 2012 handover/collection of the drugs in accordance with that established method.
	
	
	Fourth, that Suky Lieu communicated in code with John about their illegal drug businesses and they did so in respect of the 2 July 2012 trafficking incident.
	
	
	Fifth, that Suky Lieu made arrangements with John for meetings/handovers of drugs in Sydney as and when they were available and required and the 2 July 2012 handover occurred, in accordance with those arrangements, as part of his illegal drug supply business.
	
	
	Sixth, that each of Suky Lieu and John used associates (or subordinates) to carry out particular tasks on their behalf in the conduct of their illegal drug businesses, and they each did so for the purpose of facilitating the 2 July 2012 transaction.
	
	
	Seventh, that when drugs were available in Sydney, Suky Lieu directed and used Melbourne associates or subordinates to travel to Sydney to meet with John's associates in order to collect the drugs and then transport them back to Melbourne, and they did so for the purpose of facilitating the 2 July 2012 transaction.
	
	
	Eighth, that the accused and his brother were associates of Suky Lieu and were familiar with the nature and modus operandi of Suky Lieu's illegal drug trafficking business, and they were aware that the 2 July 2012 transaction was being undertaken as part of that business.
	
	
	Ninth, that the accused and his brother communicated in code with Suky Lieu, and each other, in order to conceal or hide the true meaning of their communications because those communications concerned Suky Lieu's illegal drug trafficking business.
	
	
	Tenth, that the accused and his brother came to Sydney from Melbourne at the direction of Suky Lieu for the purpose of meeting with one of John's associates in order to collect drugs from John's associate, transport the drugs to another location and facilitate Harris' concealment and further dealing with the drugs.
	
	
	Eleventh, that the accused did not come to Sydney simply on a whim to accompany his brother for some unknown/unspecified purpose (as the accused claimed was the reason for coming to Sydney during his arrest conversation and subsequent interview with police).
	
	
	Twelfth, that the accused deliberately lied to police, firstly about his reason for coming to Sydney, secondly about where he and his brother had been whilst there and, thirdly, about with whom he and his brother had met on 2 July 2012, all out of a consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	On those identified bases, the Crown contends that the evidence is relevant, as capable of indirectly (that is, circumstantially when all evidence is considered together) affecting the probability of the existence of the central facts in issue, that is the matters earlier outlined concerning the accused’s state of mind and, accordingly, is admissible.
	
	
	In addition, but solely in respect of the fifth period, that is, only in relation to the admitted trafficking by the accused whilst on bail for the present offence, the Crown contends that the material identified in the tendency notice is admissible to prove that the accused has a tendency to act in a particular way and with a particular state of mind. The asserted tendency is expressed as a tendency to knowingly engage in trafficking controlled drugs at the direction of Suky Lieu.
	
	
	In this respect, the Crown contends that material intended as tendency evidence is relevant to proof of the central facts in issue, that being, as already observed, the relevant states of the accused’s mind on 2 July 2012. The Crown submits that the evidence is capable of proving that the accused has a tendency to act in the way identified in the notice and, accordingly, to have had the relevant states of mind on 2 July. In particular, it is submitted that such a tendency is highly relevant and probative of those central facts in issue, particularly in light of the anticipated defence.
	
	
	Turning then to the specific objections made to the tender of the material.
	
	
	None of the material is tendered for a hearsay purpose and in my assessment the objection on that ground is misconceived.
	
	
	As to the material relating to the first two time periods (see para 13 and 14 above), for the reasons articulated by the Crown, and outlined above, I am satisfied that the evidence is relevant. Its probative value is, in my assessment, reasonably high. The submissions to the contrary on behalf of the accused seem to me to misapprehend the capacity of that contextual material to sensibly inform an assessment of the offending, particularly so far as the requisite mental states are concerned. Both periods give context, by their elucidation of the nature of and methods employed in the business of Suky Lieu and John. In addition, the second period introduces familiarity on the part of the accused with that business and his brother’s role within it. The second period, to a very limited extent, also introduces some minor association of the accused with that business and some action or foreshadowed action on his part at the direction or instruction variously of his brother or Suky Lieu. Subject to the operation of s 137 of the Evidence Act, the evidence relating to the first two periods should be admitted.
	
	
	In respect of these first two time periods the accused made substantially the same submissions concerning the risk of unfair prejudice, or prejudicial effect, as he did in respect of the fourth and fifth periods. In essence, the submission was that the evidence is likely to provoke some emotional, irrational or illogical response on the part of the jury, resulting in the evidence being given more weight than it deserves. So far as the postulated effect of the evidence concerning these two periods was concerned, the accused submitted that the evidence was susceptible to the following prejudicial effects.
	
	
	First, that the jury may deem the accused to be guilty because he appears to fit within the potentially stereotypical Vietnamese or Asian drug trafficker, without having due regard to the particular evidence and issues in the trial.
	
	
	Second, that the jury may punish the accused for criminal behaviour of other members of the syndicate implicated in the background or context evidence, without having due regard to the personal criminality, if any, of the accused.
	
	
	Third, that the jury may deem that the accused was criminally associated with Suky Lieu long before the period when his association with Suky Lieu is reflected in the intercept material.
	
	
	Fourth that the jury will be overwhelmed by the volume and breadth of the material, which, so it is submitted, is not relevant to the central issues in the trial and will, accordingly, adopt one or other or more of the courses outlined in the preceding three purported prejudicial effects.
	
	
	I do not consider that there is relevantly any risk of unfair prejudice arising from the material relating to the first two periods. Even if I am wrong about that, it seems to me that with appropriate directions the probative value of the evidence is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	On balance, I have reached the same conclusions in relation to the evidence pertaining to the fourth period. It is sufficiently connected, temporally and otherwise, to the events and circumstances surrounding the charged offence, and by its character it is sufficiently similar to the evidence relating to the first two periods to admit of the same conclusions concerning both its admissibility and the inappropriateness of its exclusion under s 137. Like the evidence relating to the first period, the evidence sought to be adduced by reference to the fourth time period is less about the direct association of the accused with the business of Suky Lieu and more about providing background or context which can further sensibly inform an assessment of the aspects of the offending in proof of which it is proposed to be tendered.
	
	
	The material relating to the fifth period is in quite a different category to the balance of the material sought to be adduced.
	
	
	The evidence relating to this period is tendered both on a general circumstantial basis and, additionally or alternatively, for a tendency purpose. This period differs substantially from the earlier periods because it involves admitted criminal conduct on the part of the accused, in respect of his plea to what the County Court characterized as “street level” dealing offences. In the context of that offending, it also involves admitted association with Suky Lieu and admission to acting at his instruction and direction.
	
	
	Logic dictates that the evidence has probative value, for precisely the reasons accepted in respect of the first, second and fourth periods. This is particularly true to the extent it gives further background and context concerning the business of Suky Lieu, and an association of the accused with it, at least at this later point in time. The probative value is necessarily more limited, in my assessment, than the evidence which relates to periods more immediately surrounding, and in particular prior to, the alleged offending conduct. Minds might differ about whether the probative value of this evidence is “significant”. I consider that the temporal disassociation of the conduct from the alleged offending, in particular the fact that it is subsequent to the relevant events, and the different character of the offending (that is, involving street level dealing on the one hand and alleged involvement in much more substantial trafficking on the other) both militate against a conclusion that the evidence has significant probative value. But it is a question of degree.
	
	
	I think as a matter of logic, principle and human experience there must be real limits to the extent to which subsequent conduct can rationally inform an assessment of the existence of a particular state of mind at an earlier point in time.
	
	
	I think there is a point of real distinction between cases which accept the significant probative capacity of evidence of particular personal predilection, such as a sexual interest in children, or even a particular child, for example and the probative capacity of other, later, criminal conduct of a similar but not identical kind, to inform specific states of mind like recklessness and knowledge at a specific, earlier, point in time in relation to a particular event or circumstance that has at best only an indirect connection to the later offending conduct: cf RH v R [2014] NSWCCA 71.
	
	
	Be that as it may, the evidence is relevant and subject to statutory thresholds, such as that in s 97 of the Evidence Act, and exclusionary provisions, relevantly in ss 101 and 137 of that Act, according to the particular separate bases on which it is tendered, it is admissible.
	
	
	Dealing with the evidence first on the basis of its tender as general circumstantial evidence, I am, as I have indicated, of the view that it is prima facie admissible.
	
	
	The question then arises whether it gives rise to a danger of unfair prejudice which outweighs its probative value.
	
	
	To the particular prejudicial effects advanced by the accused in respect of the other contested evidence, which I have already outlined (see paragraphs 63 to 67 above), he adds the following additional contention.
	
	
	It is submitted that the jury may in effect punish the accused for his conduct the subject of the Victorian proceedings, for which he has already served his sentence, without having due regard to the particular evidence and issues in the present trial and the differences in the conduct to which the present trial and the Victorian proceedings each relate.
	
	
	The relevant enquiry as to the existence or otherwise of a risk of unfair prejudice demands consideration of whether the jury might misuse the evidence in some unfair way, for example on account of the evidence provoking some irrational, emotional or illogical response, or by giving the evidence more weight than it deserves. An enquiry of that kind necessarily involves matters of impression and degree.
	
	
	My assessment is that the evidence of the later criminal conduct, and the attendant admissions concerning it, gives rise to a real danger, divorced for the present exercise from considerations of ameliorating directions, of having a powerful, and relevantly unfair, prejudicial effect. It is apt to promote a response in the jury conducive to impermissible reasoning from the fact of admitted guilt in respect of the later matters to inevitable guilt in respect of the charged conduct. Whilst an understandable response as a matter of human experience, it is far from a rational response.
	
	
	In the present case, the danger of that particular response in a jury is real and, in my view, not readily capable of adequate amelioration by directions.
	
	
	As Gleeson CJ and Gummow J observed in Gilbert v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [13]: “The system of criminal justice as administered by appellate courts requires the assumption that as a general rule, juries understand and follow the directions they are given by trial judges. It does not involve the assumption that their decision making is unaffected by matters of possible prejudice”. It is the latter part of that proposition which informs, among other things, the existence of exclusionary discretions.
	
	
	The law recognises that not every potentially prejudicial risk can be adequately overcome, so as to ensure a fair trial, by the giving of directions. In my view, the danger to which I have adverted in respect of the evidence of the later criminal conduct here is so profound that it is not amenable to adequate amelioration by any direction which might be given.
	
	
	Accordingly, in my view the balancing exercise outlined in s 137 requires the exclusion of the evidence on the grounds that its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	I turn now to deal with the alternative basis on which the evidence is tendered, that is for a tendency purpose.
	
	
	As an aside, I should indicate that I consider there is a real question whether the so-called tendency propounded in the notice, that is a tendency “to knowingly engage in the conduct of trafficking controlled drugs at the direction of Suky Lieu”, is truly a tendency to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, in the sense comprehended by s 97 of the Evidence Act. Be that as it may, I will assume for present purposes that it is.
	
	
	I should indicate first that, for the reasons I earlier identified, I do not consider that the evidence satisfies the threshold in s 97(1)(b).
	
	
	For the reasons I have earlier identified, the evidence does have the capacity to rationally inform an assessment of the probability of the existence of specific states of mind at an earlier point in time. However, that capacity is not fairly described as significant in my view.
	
	
	As I indicated when dealing with the tender on the general circumstantial basis, there must necessarily be limits on the extent to which subsequent conduct, albeit similar but not identical in its character, and substantially different in its scope, can rationally inform an assessment of the existence of a particular state of mind, in respect of quite specific circumstances, at an earlier point in time.
	
	
	Accordingly, the probative capacity of the later criminal conduct to inform the specific states of mind of recklessness and knowledge as to specific circumstances as at 2 July, which have at best only an indirect connection to the later admitted conduct, is not reasonably characterized as significant.
	
	
	On that basis I would reject its tender as tendency evidence. In the event I am wrong about the evidence satisfying that threshold, and I accept it is a question on which minds might reasonably differ, I will consider also the balancing exercise required by s 101.
	
	
	The prejudicial effect of the evidence pertaining to the fifth period is identical, whether one is considering its tender on the general circumstantial basis, or on the basis of its use supporting tendency reasoning. As I earlier outlined, the evidence pertaining to the fifth identified period is apt to promote a response in a jury conducive to impermissible reasoning from the fact of admitted guilt in respect of the later matters to inevitable guilt in respect of the charged conduct. The prejudice, which is relevantly unfair, is profound in my assessment.
	
	
	In circumstances where I consider it so profound as to resist fair amelioration by way of directions, I have concluded that the probative value of the evidence, even if it be assessed as significant, does not substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect, that is, the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	For all the foregoing reasons, subject to any specific objections that might arise to discrete pieces of evidence, that have not necessarily been dealt with in this debate, I propose to admit the evidence pertaining to the first four periods and to reject the tender of the evidence pertaining to the fifth period.

	On 7 August 2014 I delivered some remarks regarding the offences committed by Stevan Strbac and his subjective circumstances. On that day I determined that the appropriate length of his sentence would be 22 months. I referred Mr Strbac for assessment as to his suitability to serve his sentence by way of Intensive Correction Order and the matter was adjourned to today.
	
	
	The Court has now received a report from the Fairfield Community Corrections Office dated 14 October 2015 assessing Mr Strbac as suitable for an Intensive Correction Order.
	
	
	Accordingly, I sentence Mr Strbac to 22 months imprisonment and under s 7 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an Intensive Correction Order directing that the sentence be served by way of intensive correction in the community.
	
	
	I fix the date of commencement of the sentence as today, 23 October 2015.
	
	
	I note that Ms Hutchinson has informed me that her client has received advice about the obligations of an Intensive Correction Order and the consequences if he fails to comply with the terms of the order and I regard this as satisfying the Court’s obligations under s 72 of the Crimes (Sentencing) Procedure Act 1999.
	
	
	The intensive correction order is subject to the mandatory conditions prescribed by reg 175 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008 and I note these will also be explained to Mr Strbac by his legal representatives.
	
	
	I again note that the offence of using electricity without authority has been taken into account when imposing this sentence.

2768037,R v Brewer (No. 2) [2015] NSWSC 1547,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	Adam James Brewer has pleaded not guilty to a charge that on 13 March 2014, at Pendle Hill in the State of New South Wales, he murdered Visakesvaran Velupillai (“the deceased”).
	
	
	The Crown has previously consented to the trial proceeding before a Judge alone, without a jury. The statutory framework for a trial before a Judge alone is provided by s. 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (“the CPA”) which is in the following terms:
	


133 Verdict of single Judge

(1) A Judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person. Any such finding has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury.

(2) A judgment by a Judge in any case must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied.

(3) If any Act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any such case, the Judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter.


	
	Section 133(2) of the CPA requires that I expose my reasoning process by linking the relevant principles of law with the facts as I find them to be: Flemming v R [1998] HCA 68; (1998) 197 CLR 250 cited by Bathurst CJ in W v R [2014] NSWCCA 110 at [108] – [110] (Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J agreeing). However, I am not required to express all of the matters which necessarily have to be stated to a jury unfamiliar with basic principles of the law: Markou v R [2012] NSWCCA 64; (2012) 221 A Crim R 79 per Macfarlan J (with whom R S Hulme J and R A Hulme J agreed), citing R v Winner [1995] 79 A Crim R 528 at 531.
	
	
	Further, s 133(3) applies only to warnings. It does not require that every direction given to a jury be referred to when giving judgment in a trial before a Judge alone: W (supra) at [111].
	


The FACTS


	
	Generally speaking the facts surrounding the death of the deceased are not in dispute. I find them to be as follows.
	


The scene of the deceased’s death


	
	The deceased worked at a real estate agency located at 128 Pendle Way, Pendle Hill. The front window of the premises, and a door giving access to them, faced Pendle Way in a generally easterly direction. Immediately to the right of the premises (to the north) was the entrance to an arcade. That arcade ran from Pendle Way (to the east) through to Bentley Lane (to the west). Proceeding through the arcade from Pendle Way to Bentley Lane there was a further entrance to the deceased’s premises on the left.
	
	
	Upon arriving at the premises on the morning of 13 March 2014, the deceased entered the arcade and put some items on the ground near the door to his office. He entered the premises and later swept the area of the arcade immediately outside the door.
	


The arrival of the accused at the deceased’s premises


	
	Early on the morning of 13 March 2014 the accused caught a train from Seven Hills and arrived at Pendle Hill station at approximately 6.22am. At that time he was wearing dark sunglasses, a blue singlet top, dark jeans, and sandshoes. He was carrying a plastic bag with something white coloured inside.
	
	
	Following his arrival at Pendle Hill station, the accused entered a public toilet where he remained for a period of approximately 45 minutes. He emerged wearing a white t-shirt over the blue singlet he was wearing at the time of going inside. He left Pendle Hill station via a footbridge which crossed, and then ran parallel to, the railway tracks, leading to a set of stairs. He descended the stairs and walked along Pendle Way in a generally southerly direction. At some point he crossed Pendle Way from east to west and headed towards the arcade.
	


Events following the arrival of the accused


	
	The accused arrived at the arcade and initially walked past, before turning back and entering it. He walked back up to the footpath on Pendle Way momentarily, looked around, and went back to the door of the deceased’s premises where he picked up something and went inside.
	
	
	The deceased backed out of the office holding a broom, followed by the accused. The deceased and the accused then began to fight in the arcade. Although the CCTV footage which recorded the events in the arcade is not entirely clear, the deceased at one point appeared to be on the ground struggling.
	
	
	The accused then backed down the arcade towards Bentley Lane with the deceased following him and holding onto the broom. There was a scuffle during which the broom fell onto the ground, following which the deceased hit the accused with it. At that stage the accused left the arcade via the doors into Bentley Lane. The deceased remained near the doors, inside the arcade.
	
	
	At about that time Brendan Burwood was walking along Bentley Lane past the entrance to the arcade. He saw a male (the accused) yelling at person inside the arcade (the deceased) saying words to the effect:
	


That’s assault … fuck you.


	
	Mr Burwood also heard words to a similar effect coming from inside the arcade. He said that there were also other words spoken but he did not hear them clearly. He saw only two people and described what he heard and saw as being “like an argument of some sort”.
	
	
	At about that time, the accused returned to the doors leading from the arcade to Bentley Lane. A further fight with the deceased ensued. The deceased then walked back into the arcade towards the door. The accused initially remained outside when further words appeared to be exchanged between himself and the deceased.
	


The stabbing of the deceased


	
	The deceased then walked back down the arcade towards the door of his premises. He was followed by the accused. He picked up the broom which had been previously in his possession and snapped it in half before dropping one half onto the ground. As the deceased bent over (seemingly for the purpose of picking up that part of the broom which had dropped to the ground) the accused, who by that stage had walked up the arcade towards Pendle Way and was standing nearby, commenced assaulting the deceased.
	
	
	A further fight ensued. Both the deceased and the accused moved towards the glass doors leading into Bentley Lane. Although they both moved out of the direct line of sight of the CCTV camera, their appearance in the reflection from the tiled walls of the arcade is generally consistent with them continuing to physically struggle. It was at about that time that the accused stabbed the deceased, causing him to stagger backwards and fall to the ground. The deceased then got up and tried to move back down the arcade towards his premises before stumbling and collapsing onto the ground. Photographs of the scene show blood spatter and blood stains on the floor of the arcade.
	
	
	The deceased was taken to Westmead Hospital and arrived there at 8.20am. Prior to his arrival, an entire trauma team had been assembled in light of indications that the deceased had gone into a state of cardiac arrest. Upon arrival at the hospital the deceased showed no signs of life. He was declared deceased at 8:25am.
	
	
	Dr Irvine, a Forensic Pathologist, conducted an autopsy examination on 14 March 2014. She found stab wounds in the deceased’s left chest, left axilla, left elbow, left shoulder and left hand. She concluded that the deceased died as the result of a stab wound which penetrated his chest cavity between the left fifth and sixth ribs, perforating the pericardium and incising the apex of the heart through the septum.
	


Events following the deceased’s stabbing


	
	The accused walked out of the arcade and along Bentley Lane in a generally northerly direction, carrying a milk crate. He then turned left, before crossing the railway line. He then walked east along Wentworth Avenue and then turned north before entering premises occupied by Hanson Constructions where he was discovered by an employee, Carlo Ianni, in a bathroom cubicle. At that time the following conversation took place:
	


Ianni: What the fuck are you doing in here?

Accused: I was just about to take a tub.

Ianni: Get your shit and fuck off. You’re not meant to be here. Get your stuff and get out.


	
	Mr Ianni went outside and directed another employee, Lorenzo Granda, to call the police. Mr Ianni then walked back to the bathroom and saw that the accused’s jeans had blood spatter at the front. He also observed that the accused had dried blood on both sides of his nose, on his left cheek and on his neck. At that point a further conversation took place:
	


Accused: Bro let me talk to you, let me talk to you. I got jumped by three black cunts at the station.

Ianni:   This is our lunch room and you’re covered in blood.

Accused: Help out a brother, help out a brother.

Ianni:   I’m not interested, just get the fuck out.


	
	At that point the accused started walking out of the premises followed by Mr Ianni. Shortly afterwards, the police came by and Mr Ianni provided them with a description of the accused.
	
	
	After leaving Hanson Constructions, the accused walked in a westerly direction along Wentworth Avenue. He then turned right into Ballandella Road where he walked in a northerly direction, before turning right and walking east along Hallmark Street, where he was arrested at about 8:10am.
	


The accused’s arrest


	
	The accused was arrested by Sgt. Lofts and at the time of his arrest he said (inter alia) the following:
	


You know what, listen to this, I swear on my fucken mum this wombat hit me, no shit, with the fucken thing no shit about four or five times … Yeah, four or five times before I even swung a single punch at him. I use my fist, you know me. I love my fist. Mate I fancy myself with my fist. … The fucken wombat across the road.

I tried to have a shower in Boral. They kicked me out. I go yeah, nice aussies youse kicking me out. You know what I don’t want to go back to mental, I wanna go back, I wanna go back to gaol.


	
	When placed under arrest the accused said (inter alia):
	


Yeah I understand that. I don’t want to go to Cumberland Hospital. … I don’t want to go ….


	
	When asked by Sgt. Lofts what had happened, the accused said:
	


Listen … I walked in right, I walked fair dinkum in. I walked straight into his thing. I was walking down the corridor. I was waiting for my missus she was coming through. I was picking up my done at Parramatta. My missus she was coming through, she gonna come with me. We gotta be at Court first thing in the morning … she has to be. We went to Court yesterday at twelve she had to be we … something small. Anyway I took his tucker in for him, his food, got put on the ground. Me being a crim I don’t like food on the ground.

I said fuck off fucken … and mate I give you my word find a witness I never took one thing from the shop, not a fucken pen, I never stole and never attempted to steal, I mate find a witness he hit me over the head a thousand times mate before I finally got it off him mate and feeding it to him.


	
	When asked by Sgt. Lofts what the deceased had used to hit him, the accused said:
	


A metal, a metal broom. He snapped it in half. Look, I’m bleeding all over. I asked these blokes for a thingo, they just laughed and said fuck off or I’ll smash ya.


	
	The accused then said:
	


Loftus … you know what. When you do your research I don’t think there’s too many unless another Asians going back to his play um yeah I fucken give you my word mate. He stabbed me in the head mate. He attacked me a few times brother I swear on my mum … Listen honestly put me down for starting the fight. Honestly mate put me down for starting the fight. For the record I stabbed the bloke first with a knife in the head first and then in the stomach. That’s it take me to gaol brother I don’t want to go back to hospital I wanna go to gaol. Gaol is where I belong brother. I started something before I left and I mate kick off when I get back there.


	
	The accused also spoke with Det. Roots at the time of his arrest in the course of which he said (inter alia):
	
	
	Mate, seven days ago I was planning on jumping off Centrepoint Tower. Do you think I give a fuck about what you’re recording you wombat … You think you’ve taken a bad guy off the street. I’m not a fucken bad bloke. I’m fucken good. I’m one of the good guys.
	
	
	Generally speaking, the accused appeared to be in a highly agitated state at the time of his arrest.
	


Subsequent events at the police station


	
	At the police station, when the police again told the accused he was under arrest, he responded by saying:
	


This bloke hit me in the head for the fiftieth time. He stabbed me, I stabbed him. … I’m a devil.


	
	Det. Roots then observed the accused head butting the perspex door of a holding cell located in the charge room at the police station. When he expressed his concern the accused replied:
	


Mate, you’re never going to find it. … I had a knife, I scratched it then buried it.


	
	When asked where he had buried the knife, the accused responded:
	


I’m not going to tell you… It had a black handle about this big. … you know what, I’m gonna take you guys on. Come on lets go for it. I’m gonna be put in gaol for a long time because of this, even though it was self-defence. … I want my methadone and I’ll show you where it is.


	
	The accused later told Det. Roots that he carried a knife because he had been previously stabbed.
	
	
	Whilst at the police station, the accused underwent an initial medical assessment from Rhyse Vaughan, a Paramedic. When asked if he had any auditory hallucinations, the accused responded:
	


They are telling me to hurt people … and not to trust you … you’re planning something.

The accused’s transfer to Cumberland Hospital


	
	The accused was taken from the police station to Cumberland Hospital where he was examined by Dr Mushoriwa Zinatsa, who reported:
	


During this assessment I could not find reason for hospital detention under the Mental Health Act. He is not psychotic and no signs of melancholia were observed on this assessment. He is not … manic. He denies suicidal ideas. His thought form was logical. He told me that he used the knife he was carrying to stab the other person ‘because he was using a broom on me’. He denies perceptual abnormality. He is fit to be taken into police custody and be brought before a Magistrate.


	
	Dr Zinatsa certified that at the time of his assessment, the accused was not mentally ill and was not a mentally disordered person.
	
	
	I should observe at this point that the opinion of Dr Zinatsa as to the accused’s mental state at that time is completely at odds with the opinions expressed by Dr O’Dea and Dr Allnutt. I have dealt with this issue when considering the expert evidence below.
	
	
	THE ACCUSED’S EVIDENCE
	
	
	The accused gave oral evidence before me and was cross-examined by the Crown. To the extent that he was able to recall the events leading to the deceased’s death, his recollection was, generally speaking, consistent with the circumstances of the offending as I have found them to be. The accused said (commencing at T88 L31) that on the morning of the deceased’s killing he was in possession of a knife “for protection”. He also stated (commencing at T89 L34) that at one point that morning he was carrying a mallet.
	
	
	The accused explained (commencing at T90 L14) that he had noticed a paper bag on the ground outside the deceased’s premises in the arcade. He thought it contained food. He said that when he entered the deceased’s premises he yelled out “breakfast”, following which the deceased had started to “attack” him. He described (commencing at T94 L34) the deceased going “berko” by picking up a broom and attacking him with it. He described the altercation that followed and said (at T99 L38) that he “pulled out the weapon and lunged at (the deceased)” following which he disposed of it by throwing it into nearby premises. The accused had limited independent recollection of what he had said to the police at the time of his arrest but described himself (at T106 L36) as being “upset about what had happened”.
	
	
	The accused said (commencing at T109 L26) that at the time of the incident he was “getting pills to calm (himself) down” which he later described (at T109 L38) as Rivotrol and Xanax. He also admitted taking Ice in the hours leading up to the incident.
	


THE ACCUSED’S HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS

The evidence of the accused’s mother


	
	The accused’s mother gave evidence (commencing at T154 L4) that in the early part of 2014 she observed the accused to be “erratic and jumpy” and “unsettled”. She explained (commencing at T158 L43) that there was a family history of mental illness and, in particular, a history of schizophrenia with which the accused’s uncle and eldest brother had each been diagnosed. She also gave evidence (at T159 L25) that the accused’s father was taking anti-psychotic drugs before he died in 2010.
	
	
	The accused’s mother also said that she had spoken with the accused on the day of the deceased’s killing, following his arrest. She described him (commencing at T162 L21) as having a “wild” and “fearful” look on his face.
	


Documentary evidence


	
	With the consent of counsel for the accused, the Crown tendered a bundle of medical reports and associated material detailing the accused’s history of mental illness. That material also contained evidence of medical assessments undertaken of the accused following his arrest. The entirety of that material was provided to Dr Allnutt and Dr O’Dea for their assistance in compiling their respective reports. In terms of the accused’s history of mental illness in the period leading up to the deceased’s death, the material establishes the following.
	


June – December 2011


	
	On 8 June 2011 Dr Adams, psychiatrist, provided a report to the accused’s then solicitors. At that time, the accused had been charged with offences of damaging property by fire, and break enter and steal. On that occasion Dr Adams expressed the following opinion:
	


Mr Brewer provided a clear account of how his behaviour began to deteriorate at around the age of nine years, with increasing conduct problems such as fighting, oppositional behaviour towards authority figures, truanting, destruction of property and eventually offending behaviour. Mr Brewer reported beginning to use cannabis at the age of 12 years, and how his frequency and quantity of use rapidly increased thereafter. He noted that his illicit substance use expanded to include intravenous heroin by the age of 15 years. Although the details of his exact use thereafter were vague, he described a pattern suggestive of fluctuating illicit substance and alcohol use from his early 20s onwards. His description of his most recent pattern of substance abuse was in my opinion in keeping with that of polysubstance dependence.


	
	On 1 November 2011 Dr Allnutt provided a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions in connection with the same proceedings. He reported:
	


In my opinion, at the time that I saw the accused he manifested residual symptoms of a resolving psychotic disorder categorised by flat affect (and) ongoing paranoid thoughts about others plotting to harm him but did not endorse any other significant psychotic symptoms that he has endorsed in the past; I note that he has been prescribed antidepressant and antipsychotic medication and this is probably resulted in an amelioration of his symptoms; he has a history of psychotic phenomena over a significant period of time that has impacted on his functioning; his presentation is complicated by a relatively chronic substance abuse disorder including methamphetamines, amphetamines, heroin and cannabis; while drug induced psychosis is a possible diagnosis, it is most likely that he has an underlying chronic psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder which is aggravated by intermittent substance abuse.

At the time that he saw me he described some symptoms that could be consistent with depression including reduced motivation, poor self esteem, loss of interest in activities, anhedonia and reduced energy; but these could also be attributable to negative symptoms of schizophrenia or side effects to psychotic medication (or a combination); in my view these symptoms are most likely attributable to either medication or his schizophrenia predominantly rather than independent depressive disorder”.


	
	In a supplementary report of 16 November 2011 Dr Adams said:
	


In my opinion Mr Brewer’s clinical presentation is in keeping with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. He has a history of experiencing classical symptoms of this illness, namely delusions, hallucinations and disintegration of his thought processes. Mr Brewer also has a history of polysubstance dependence.

January 2012


	
	On 31 January 2012 the accused was taken into custody after being arrested for an offence of break enter and steal. Whilst in custody, he was seen to be standing backwards inside a dock with the door open, attempting to place his underpants (formed into a noose and tied to the top hinge of the open door) around his neck. He was taken to hospital and the following was recorded:
	


Patient was released from jail 2 days ago and yesterday, break and enter attempt, fell through roof, found by police and placed in cell. While in custody, he attempted to harm himself by hanging himself with underwear. Found to have small abrasion on nose, left hand laceration and small abrasion of the right knee. Patient could not tell me why he wanted to end his life. Possible stressors include returning to jail because of breaking parole and additional charges. Patient vague about his medical problems. Difficult to interview because he is slow to respond to answers and requires constant repeating. He appeared drug affected.

February 2012


	
	On 29 February 2012 the accused was in custody at Bathurst Correctional Centre where he was seen by Timothy Hodges, psychologist. Mr Hodges reported (inter alia) as follows:
	


I interviewed Adam Brewer in the wing, he reports that he did try to hang himself with his underwear last month in Police custody but does not remember the event. He stated he has no self harm or suicidal ideation and he presents with good future orientation. He stated that he was under the influence of Xanax and cannot remember anything. He reports he has no self harm or suicidal ideation and had he not taken the Xanax he would never have attempted to hang himself. He reports that when the police told him that he had attempted to hang himself and (sic) he stated he was ‘really surprised’. He stated he has no history of self-harm and has no intention of doing it. He reports he has ‘to (sic) much to live for’, he stated he will not be taking Xanax again.

January 2014


	
	On 18 January 2014 the accused was arrested for stealing. Whilst under arrest he said to police:
	


I’ve had enough, I’m going to end it.


	
	When placed into the police vehicle the accused was seen to be “ramming” himself into the side walls of the rear cage. He was taken to Cumberland Hospital where a mental health assessment noted that he had been “diagnosed as schizophrenia (sic) in gaol”.
	
	
	The history recorded by the Triage Nurse recorded the following:
	


Bizarre behaviour, under arrest pt scheduled with police, eyes closed at triage responds to voice answering appropriately.


	
	A subsequent mental health assessment recorded the following:
	


He was brought in by police as he expressed suicidal ideations to them. He was arrested today as he was shoplifting.

He doesn’t know why police arrested him. He reports that he was cooking at his mother’s place and he needed some items so he went to the shop. On counter, he took his wallet out and along with his wallet, knife came out and the person on the other side called police.

He was in prison for 2½ years because he ‘broke in’ he doesn’t want to give more detail. He denies any + diagnoses but later he mentioned he has schizophrenia.

February 2014


	
	On 24 February 2014 the accused underwent psychiatric assessment at Cumberland Hospital. Past diagnoses of schizophrenia, auditory hallucinations and paranoia were noted.
	
	
	A mental health assessment conducted on 25 February 2014 noted that the accused had suicidal thoughts, auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions. Provisional diagnoses of a relapse of schizophrenia and substance abuse were made.
	


March 2014


	
	On the morning of 3 March 2014 (which was only 10 days prior to the death of the deceased) the accused was seen to be pushing a shopping trolley containing a bolt cutter into the rear entrance of the administration block of Blacktown TAFE. A witness followed the accused into a classroom and observed him standing at a whiteboard pretending to teach a class. The accused was writing several words on the whiteboard before turning and sitting at a desk. At that point, he pretended to type on a computer. A security officer attended and entered the classroom and observed the accused sitting at the computer and talking to himself. The security officer asked the accused to leave and said that he would escort him to the railway station. The accused followed the security officer to the rear of the building where he had left the trolley. The accused then left the area.
	
	
	Later that morning, the police were alerted to the presence of the accused at the Centrelink office at Blacktown. The accused had entered the premises via a rear fire exit, put on a fire helmet and commenced talking to himself. He told Centrelink staff that he wanted to “lay on the train track and die” and said that he was hearing “voices”. When police arrived the accused said he wanted to end his life and that he intended to hit himself with a sledge hammer, stab himself and jump from the roof of the Centrelink building. When told he would be transferred to a mental health facility, the accused became aggressive, telling the police that he would stab, fight and kill anyone who came near him.
	
	
	The accused was taken to Blacktown Hospital. He continued to state that he would fight, kill, stab and murder anyone who came near him. He stated:
	


I know the game, I’ll just say it’s all bullshit, they will just let me go.


	
	The accused was examined by Dr Baheti, who initially decided that he should be released. After the police had expressed their concerns about the accused being released, Dr Baheti admitted him. The accused was then seen to violently head butt the concrete walls of the hospital building, and was restrained.
	
	
	Later that day, police received a radio message stating that there was a patient (later identified as the accused) in the roof of Bungaribee House (which is part of Blacktown Hospital) threatening self-harm. Upon arrival, police were advised that the accused broke the bed in his room and used the timber from it to damage the roof and gain access to the roof cavity. He then climbed into the roof carrying various pieces of broken timber from his bed. Police gained access to the roof through a manhole. The accused ran away from them in an attempt to avoid apprehension. He managed to climb through a small window and then jumped onto the ground from the roof. Due to the significant police presence he was apprehended immediately.
	
	
	As a consequence of those events it was determined that Bungaribee House was not a suitable location at which to house the accused. He was transferred to Cumberland Hospital with the assistance of police. When asked about his actions at Bungaribee House the accused said:
	


I had a fucking brain snap, I’m good now though. The bitch nurse wouldn’t give me food or drink. I asked her so many times and she wouldn’t give me anything so I had to get out of here to get some.


	
	The accused was examined at Cumberland Hospital by Dr Rudas and Dr Baheti and his past psychiatric history was noted. A history taken from the accused’s mother (which she confirmed in evidence) was recorded as follows:
	


She reports that drugs are a big issue in pt life. He has threatened to kill himself at home. She is not aware of previous suicide attempt. She did not know how he had stab wounds on his abdomen. She is concerned about him and thinks he should be in hospital as he is at risk to harm himself.


	
	Further notes taken on the same day record the following additional history provided by the accused’s mother:
	


Says pt has problem with drugs. Causes him to have unsettled behaviour. Over last few days prior to admission, not in control of self. Thoughts were all over the place. Also talking about suicide.

Not sure what drugs he uses. At times gets overactive … at other times not. At times gets v depressed – ‘that’s why he drugs’. Also gets anxious.

Went to prison one time because he set a fire in a bin which spread to a building, burned it badly.

While in prison diagnosed schizophrenia. He gets paranoid at times, says people have been in his room.

At one time he was carrying a knife ‘to stop people trying to stop him committing suicide”!!

Pts fa had alcohol induced psychosis. Paternal uncle committed suicide. Half bro has schizophrenia.


	
	On 6 March the accused was examined by Dr Hoult, psychiatrist who noted:
	


“He admits to hearing voices until 2 days ago. His speech is slightly slurred. He does not yet appear to be adequately care for himself. Still mentally disturbed”.


	
	The accused remained at Cumberland Hospital until 11 March 2014. On the day before his discharge the accused was interviewed by a social worker who noted (inter alia):
	
	
	Burnt a building down 5 yrs ago – when first started hearing voices.
	
	
	Medical assessments post arrest 
	
	
	The accused has undergone a number of medical assessments since being taken into custody. Whilst I do not propose to set out the results of those assessments in their entirety, I do note the following:
	



	
	on 27 April 2014 a mental health review noted that the accused displayed illogical thought processes;
	
	
	on 14 May 2015 it was noted that the accused was hearing voices. Thought form disorder was detected;
	
	
	on 24 May 2014 the accused reported hearing voices;
	
	
	on 22 September 2014 a deterioration in the accused’s mental health was noted, particularly in terms of the level of his paranoia;
	
	
	on 7 October 2014 it was noted that the accused had persecutory beliefs, and that he thought that people were following him and interfering with his food.
	


THE EXPERT PSYCHIATRIC EVIDENCE


	
	Two expert reports, one of Dr Allnutt of 12 October 2015, and the other of Dr O’Dea of 12 October 2015, were tendered in the trial. Dr Allnutt examined the accused at the request of his solicitor. Dr O’Dea examined the accused at the request of the Crown. Both doctors gave oral evidence before me. Both had been provided with the documentation referred to at [44] above, as well as with a transcript of the accused’s evidence.
	


The evidence of Dr O’Dea


	
	In his report Dr O’Dea (commencing at [42]) diagnosed the accused as suffering from schizophrenic illness, complicated by polysubstance use disorder and a vulnerable personality with antisocial traits. Dr O’Dea went on to say (commencing at [45]):
	


[45] On the basis of Mr Brewer's history, and the information available to me, it seems reasonable to assume that his schizophrenic illness was not under adequate control in the weeks leading up to the alleged offence and in the weeks following the alleged offence. On the basis of the natural history of schizophrenic illnesses, it is reasonable to assume that at the time of the alleged offence, his schizophrenic illness would have been similarly active. His apparent demeanor at the time of his arrest by police was in keeping with this view.

[46] As such, and from a psychiatric perspective, it could be argued that he has the defence of substantial impairment available to him. His schizophrenic illness would be considered an underlying condition, and his active symptoms and signs of his schizophrenic illness at the time of the alleged offence, (including paranoia and affective instability) would be considered an abnormality of the mind arising from this underlying condition. It could be argued that this abnormality of the mind arising from this underlying condition would have substantially impaired his capacity to control his actions in relation to the alleged offence.


	
	Significantly however, Dr O’Dea also said (commencing at [48]):
	


[48] In addition, I would consider that, from a psychiatric perspective, Mr Brewer would also have the insanity defence available to him. His schizophrenic illness would be considered a disease of the mind, and his active symptoms and signs of his schizophrenic illness at the time of the alleged offence would constitute a defect of reason by virtue of a disease of the mind. It could be argued that this defect would have resulted in Mr Brewer not knowing that his actions in relation to the alleged offence were wrong, in so far as he would not have been able to reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure.

[49] Whilst self-defence is a legal issue, and Mr Brewer may have believed that the deceased may have kill him, his actions in not fleeing the scene when he apparently had the opportunity to do so, if in fact that was the case, would point to his problems at the time with his ability to reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure.

[50] Regardless of the outcome of the Court proceedings, Mr Brewer will require long term, successful and ongoing psychiatric treatment, initially in a secure psychiatric facility, and long term abstinence from alcohol and illicit substance use, in order to maximise his response to treatment and minimise his risk of further offending behaviour, with the insanity defence likely to facilitate this process.


	
	When asked by the Crown Prosecutor to explain the basis of his opinion that the accused had available to him a defence of mental illness, Dr O’Dea responded (commencing at T192 L8):
	


A. As detailed there, because I diagnosed him as suffering from a schizophrenic illness, which I would consider would satisfy the concept of a disease of the mind, and I considered, extrapolating back to the time of the alleged offence, that it could be argued that at that stage he was suffering from a defect of reason by virtue of that disease of the mind or schizophrenic illness, and it could be argued that, on that basis, he was not able to reason about the matters in relation to the alleged offence with a moderate degree and sense of composure, and therefore that that could satisfy the second arm of the M'Naghten rules.

Q. And in paragraph 46 you say that he was substantially impaired in his ability to control his actions?

A. Yes.

Q. And how do you compare that inability to control his actions due to a substantial impairment, how do you compare that with what you've indicated in relation to the insanity or mental illness defence?

A. Well I am not sure how to answer that, but I am not sure that I, you know, there's a direct comparison in so far as, from a psychiatric point of view, his schizophrenic illness, and the disabilities and impairments related to that at the time of the alleged offence would seem to me to satisfy both of those sets of conditions, the insanity defence, of course, being more prescriptive in detail, and the substantial impairment one being less so. Because my view is that they're different kinds of concepts, but a schizophrenic illness I would consider would satisfy both an underlying condition, as set out in the substantial impairment defence, and a disease of the mind in the insanity defence.

Q. And of the two of them, so far as you're concerned, does one fit better the circumstances of the accused than the other?

A. Yes, I think that the one that probably fits better for Mr Brewer is the insanity defence, on the basis that it is something that I highlighted in paragraph 50.

Whilst in terms of criminal responsibility both would fit, from a psychiatric point of view, the insanity defence, his condition is much more a disease of the mind as we would understand it, I guess, than an underlying condition, which is a bit more general.


	
	He was then asked in cross-examination (commencing at T197 L33):
	


Q. … so would it be fair to put it this way; that he actually, because of his mental illness, was not capable of taking the sensible and safe option that maybe a rational not mentally ill person was?

A. Well that's the upshot, isn't it. The thesis is that his mental impairment, or sorry, mental illness impaired his ability to do that, to an extent that it rendered him, from the perspective of the law, not capable, because none of this is all or none, where it's either he's 100% in control or zero per cent in control and 100% out of control.


	
	When asked by me whether, in terms of any defence of mental illness, he took the view that the accused did not know the nature and quality of his act, or that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong, Dr O’Dea responded (commencing at T197 L50):
	


A. Yeah, my view is that he didn't know what he was doing was wrong, and I based that view on what I understand in the legal circumstances is meant by that, which is that he was not able to reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure, as I understand it's been detailed in case law.

Q. And what was it in particular about his mental condition at the time that, in your view, prevented him from being able to reason in that way?

A. His overall schizophrenia and, well, schizophrenic illness, and of course there's two components when I say that. One is the sort of active symptoms that I hypothesised at the time, because, of course, I'm extrapolating backwards, and the other is, in addition to the active symptoms, the underlying deficits, and of course the active symptoms at the time that I'm postulating are significant problems with his affect, insofar as he was irritable, angry and aroused, to a, you know, whilst everybody has those emotions from time to time, his was a sustained and disabling level of those emotions, together with his level of paranoia at the time, together with the inconsistent account, the account of experiencing auditory hallucinations of his father, and that was sort of the upfront symptoms that would have been causing that, and the underlying ones, which are those of schizophrenia, which is essentially considered a brain disorder, there's a whole lot of underlying brain deficits, which is in areas of judgment and understanding and weighing up of the various components of what people should or shouldn't do. Schizophrenia is fundamentally a cognitive condition.

Q. I think you acknowledged in that answer that, obviously, you examined the accused sometime after the event?

A. Yes.

Q. In terms of the symptoms that you've described, I take it that what you're

saying is that, in your opinion, given the history and given all the material of which you were provided, the likelihood is that he was exhibiting some or all of those symptoms at the time of the offending?

A. That's correct, and I think, as I've said in the report, it was based on the fact that there was a number of psychiatrists, not 100% of them, but a number of psychiatrists who were reporting, leading up to the alleged offence, that he had a major schizophrenic illness, and then, after the event a number of psychiatrists considered that he was having an ongoing psychosis, and the nature of schizophrenia and the natural history of schizophrenia is such that it doesn't wax and wane where people are very unwell one day and then two days later they're very well and then they become very unwell again subsequent to that. They're usually fluctuating, but very unwell through the whole process, and therefore I think there is good reason to extrapolate and speculate that in between times, that is at the time of the alleged offence, he was still very unwell from the perspective of his schizophrenia.

The evidence of Dr Allnutt


	
	In his report, Dr Allnutt concluded (at p. 14) that the accused suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, or a schizoaffective disorder, which was aggravated by the ingestion of various substances. Dr Allnutt took the view that the accused’s illness had been compounded by a persisting tendency to discontinue prescribed medication, and by a severe substance use disorder characterised by the use of cannabis, methamphetamines, heroin, alprazolam, cocaine and (possibly) alcohol.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt specifically considered the accused’s mental state at the time of killing the deceased. He concluded that in light of the accused’s family history there was a likely genetic predisposition to the development of a chronic psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. He noted, in particular, that at the time of the accused’s various hospital admissions between January 2014 and March 2014, the accused had reported auditory hallucinations and thoughts of being followed and being under threat.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt concluded that the accused’s history was consistent with a propensity to engage in impulsive behaviour when in a psychotic state and when using substances. He said in particular (at p. 15 of his report):
	


Thus at the material time of the alleged offending occurred the defendant was experiencing a constellation of psychotic and anxiety symptoms and was also likely disinhibited due to intoxication by methamphetamine that he had recently taken (I did not have a blood test).

The defendant describes entering the deceased's premises with the intention of bringing hot food inside. It is after this that the alleged interaction and (sic) the defendant commenced. This appears to be have been a relatively impulsive decision on the part of the defendant.

Given the probable underlying diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, aggravated by methamphetamines I believe there are grounds to conclude that he manifested both an ""underlying condition"" (paranoid schizophrenia) causing an ""abnormality of mind"" (psychosis).

Thus the defendant was experiencing a state of mind that could have impacted on his capacity to understand events, know right from wrong, and control his actions to a substantial degree.

Determining whether this was the case is difficult because the defendant's perception of being under attack (based on the CCTV video) is reality-based. That is, the defendant correctly understood that he was involved in an aggressive interaction with the deceased and that there was a potential for serious harm.

The CCTV footage is somewhat ambiguous, as it appears that both deceased and accused alternated in their role as aggressor (this is however a matter for the court). In my view determination needs to be made as to whether or not the stabbing would be regarded as purely an attack, purely defensive or a ""pre-emptive strike"" on the part of the accused - that is a defensive attack. His account is that it was of a defensive nature.

At the time of his arrest the video footage does not reveal overt symptoms of psychosis. He does report that he felt justified in regard to his actions at the material time of the alleged offence, which persisted while in police custody. There is however evidence of psychotic symptoms preceding and following the alleged offence and on this basis on balance he was psychotic at the material time of the alleged offence.


	
	When giving evidence Dr Allnutt was taken (commencing at T167 L42) to the contents of paragraph [48] of the report of Dr O’Dea, in which Dr O’Dea had expressed the view that the accused had a defence of mental illness available to him. When asked whether he agreed with that opinion Dr Allnutt said:
	


A. Can I say that, I think the issue is difficult, it's a difficult determination to make. On the one hand, this offence is, to a large degree, reality based.

Q. Can I stop you there. That's a phrase you've used throughout your report and consistently; what do you mean by that?

A. Well, that there are reasonable grounds to be of the view that at the time of the alleged offending, he felt threatened for real reasons, rather than feeling threatened because of a frank delusional belief in absolute terms. And what makes it difficult, is that there is potentially an overlap between being psychotic, and prone to feel threatened and being threatened which makes it difficult to determine around the relative contribution that the illness makes to the offending.


	
	Dr Allnutt then continued (commencing at T172 L11):
	


The one thing that does go towards mental illness defence, and towards not knowing right from wrong, I think, is his apparent sense of justification, that seems to me to be authentic, but at the time that the CCTV when they arrest him, and also to some degree, I think it came across in his evidence, that he still feels justified that he was being attacked.

Justification, when it's derived from a delusional belief is an irrational justification and interferes with the person to reason about wrongfulness because you feel it’s right. Really, it's a spectrum that the Court has to consider. If the Court is considering any one of those defences. It lies somewhere in that spectrum and it's difficult to determine where on that spectrum it lies.


	
	Dr Allnutt was firm in his opinion (at T180 L20) that the accused’s psychosis was present prior to his act of killing the deceased. Importantly, in terms of a defence of mental illness, Dr Allnutt said (commencing T188 L10):
	


One of the things that is always difficult to differentiate if one's considering a substantial impairment defence verses an insanity defence, is distinguishing between the arms so, on an insanity defence, he would have a disease of the mind…Distinguishing between knowing right from wrong being substantially impaired to know right from wrong, or being able to reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure, I'm not sure how one distinguishes those two. I would say that an insanity defence is open to him on that basis. And it depends on how the Court distinguishes between those two arms as to which box the Court would put it into.


	
	THE ISSUES 
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s act of stabbing the deceased caused the deceased’s death. I am also satisfied that in stabbing the deceased the accused acted voluntarily. Indeed, the parties agreed that there was no issue as to either of those matters.
	
	
	Ultimately the parties also agreed, having regard to the entirety of the evidence, that the first substantive issue to be considered was whether or not a defence of mental illness was available. It was agreed that in the event that I were to conclude that such a defence was not available, issues of self-defence and substantial impairment would arise. However, before turning to any of those issues it is necessary for me to consider a discreet matter raised by counsel for the accused.
	


The accused’s disavowal of a defence of mental illness


	
	In the course of his evidence (commencing at T110 L25) the accused said the following:
	


Q. You don't want to run a defence of mental illness, that is in the sense that you were in effect criminally insane at the time, do you?

A. No.

Q. Why don't you?

A. Because I'm not.

Q. Why do you say that?

A. Because I'm not. I know what happened that day, I know what I was feeling.

Q. What were you feeling?

A. Well, I was normal.

Q. Why were you normal?

A. Well, because I was.


	
	In respect of the accused’s assertion that he was “normal”, Dr Allnutt said (commencing at T179 L44)
	


A. No, I wouldn't put much weight on a person with ‑ if it's accepted that he was experiencing psychotic symptoms, then saying he's normal would be a lack of insight. And that's consistent with psychosis. So I wouldn't put weight on his interpretation of his feeling normal. And there's also what he meant by the word ""normal"". But we know he was taking substances.

HIS HONOUR

Q. What is normal to him may be completely abnormal to someone else?

A. Correct.


	
	Mr Skinner, who appeared on behalf of the accused, confirmed (commencing at T164 L1) that his instructions were “not to run a defence of mental illness”. He said that he considered himself bound in that regard. However he later accepted if the issue of a defence of mental illness arose on the evidence it should, notwithstanding his instructions, be addressed. Mr Skinner said (at T164 L12):
	


“…..if its raised on the evidence, it’s a matter that should be considered. If I can assist in that regard, I will. I won’t attack it, I don’t think I’m obliged to do that”.


	
	In the course of submissions Mr Skinner confirmed that position (at T210 L40) and conceded (commencing at T212 L33) that he could not “rationally argue against considering a defence of mental illness first before considering any other issue that might arise on the evidence”.
	
	
	I was referred by Mr Skinner to a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Dezfouli v R [2007] NSWCCA 86. In that case the appellant, after a special hearing conducted pursuant to s. 21 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, was found not guilty, on the grounds of mental illness, of charges of manslaughter and maliciously damaging property by fire. Bell J (as her Honour then was) noted (at [43]) that in the course of the special hearing senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant had not acted in accordance with his instructions in putting to the jury that there was “no doubt” that the appellant was insane. Her Honour concluded (at [46]):
	


[46] The scheme of the Act is designed to ensure that an accused person’s interests are protected in circumstances in which it is recognised that because of mental illness or incapacity he or she lacks the capacity to make reasoned forensic decisions. The special hearing was conducted by Mr Toner in an endeavour to advance the appellant’s interests as he perceived them to be. Counsel was not required to follow the appellant’s instructions.


	
	The present proceedings are a trial. They are not a special hearing. Both Dr Allnutt and Dr O’Dea came to the view that this accused is fit to be tried. Accordingly, her Honour’s observations as to the relevance of the scheme of special hearings have limited application to the present circumstances.
	
	
	As I have noted, Mr Skinner accepted that in the present case a defence of mental illness is squarely raised by the evidence of Dr Allnutt and Dr O’Dea. In R v Foy (1922) 39 WN (NSW) 20, Cullen CJ observed (at 21):
	


“As it would be contrary to justice that a person should be convicted of crime committed whilst he was insane merely because he himself later does not set up that defence, an issue on the question might properly be left to the jury though (the accused) relies at the trial on a defence on the merits only.”


	
	For present purposes, I constitute the jury. In the circumstances, and given the opinions of Dr Allnutt and Dr O’Dea, the defence of mental illness must be considered, notwithstanding the accused’s stated position and his instructions to his counsel.
	


THE DEFENCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS

The statutory provisions


	
	Section 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (“the MHFPA”) is in the following terms:
	


38 Special verdict

(1) If, in an indictment or information, an act or omission is charged against a person as an offence and it is given in evidence on the trial of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be reasonable, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done or omission made, then, if it appears to the jury before which the person is tried that the person did the act or made the omission charged, but was mentally ill at the time when the person did or made the same, the jury must return a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness.

(2) If a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness is returned at the trial of a person for an offence, the court may remand the person in custody until the making of an order under section 39 in respect of the person.


	
	In the event that a special verdict is returned pursuant to s.38 of the MHFPA, the provisions of s.39 then apply:
	


39 Effect of finding and declaration of mental illness

(1) If, on the trial of a person charged with an offence, the jury returns a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness, the court may order that the person be detained in such place and in such manner as the court thinks fit until released by due process of law or may make such other order (including an order releasing the person from custody, either unconditionally or subject to conditions) as the court considers appropriate.

(2) The court is not to make an order under this section for the release of a person from custody unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person’s release.

(3) As soon as practicable after the making of an order under this section, the Registrar of the Court is to notify the Minister for Health and the Tribunal of the term of the order.


	
	I note that s. 37 requires that certain explanations be given to the jury where a question of mental illness is raised. As I constitute the jury in the present proceedings, I have had regard to the provisions of s. 37.
	
	
	The principles applicable to a defence of mental illness
	
	
	In order for a defence of mental illness to be made out, there must be evidence that at the time of committing the act causing the deceased’s death the accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind, as to not know the quality and nature of the act that he was doing or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong: R v McNaughten (1843) 8 ER 718; R v S [1979] 2 NSWLR 1.
	
	
	The test was stated by Dixon J in R v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182 at 189-190 in the following terms:
	


The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know, in this sense, whether his act was wrong if, through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind, he could not think rationally of the reasons which, to ordinary people, make that act right or wrong?

If, through this disordered condition of the mind, he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure, it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by wrong? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people.


	
	In R v Stables [2014] NSWSC 697 Hidden J considered (commencing at [28]) the proper approach to be taken in a case where an accused is charged with a crime of specific intent, and a defence of mental illness is raised. His Honour noted that in R v Minani [2005] NSWCCA 26; (2005) 63 NSWLR 490 Hunt AJA (with whom Spigelman CJ and Howie J agreed) had said (at [32]):
	


Proof of the specific intention which the Crown must prove in such a case is not always an easy one where there is an element of mental illness involved. In Hawkins v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 500 (at 510, 512-514, 517), the High Court held that, contrary to what had previously been thought to be the law in this State, evidence of mental illness is relevant to the question as to whether the accused’s act was done with the specific intent charged. The High Court held that the order in which the issue should be determined in a case where there is evidence of mental illness is:

(1) was it the act of the accused which, in this case, caused the malicious wounding?

(2) was he criminally responsible for doing that act?

(3) was that act done with the specific intention required?

The second question is resolved by a finding that mental illness had been established. The third question arises only if the second question is answered adversely to the accused and, in those circumstances, the evidence of mental illness (even though insufficient to make out the defence) is relevant to the issue of specific intent.


	
	Hidden J noted in Stables that there have been cases in which the issue has been approached in accordance with the decision in S, and in the absence of any reference to the decision in Minani. The approach in S involves determining whether all of the requisite elements of the offence have been proved before considering the availability of a defence of mental illness. I made reference to these issues in R v Brindley [2014] NSWSC 1274 and concluded (as had Hidden J in Stables) that the adoption of either approach in the circumstances of that particular case produced the same result.
	
	
	In the present case, I have already concluded that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s voluntary act caused the death of the deceased. In my view, the approach set out in Minani, which follows that of the High Court in Hawkins, is the preferable one. Adopting that approach, and having already concluded that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s voluntary act caused the deceased’s death, I must proceed to consider the defence of mental illness. However, I should say that the adoption of the approach set out in S would lead me to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in stabbing the deceased, the accused intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. That would similarly lead to a necessity to consider the defence of mental illness. It follows that such defence arises for consideration, irrespective of the approach which is adopted.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	I have already outlined the evidence of Dr Allnutt and Dr O’Dea. Both of them had available the voluminous material documenting the accused’s history of mental illness. Both concluded that the accused was suffering from a schizophrenic disorder at the time of stabbing the deceased.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea was firm in his opinion that at the time of killing the deceased the accused was not able to reason about the circumstances with a moderate degree of sense and composure. He said that in his opinion the accused did not know that what he was doing in stabbing the deceased was wrong, a circumstance which he attributed to the accused’s schizophrenic illness.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea acknowledged that in expressing these opinions he had obviously assessed the accused sometime after the event, such that he had, in effect, worked backwards. However, it is clear from his evidence that Dr O’Dea placed considerable weight on the material documenting the accused’s history of mental illness, some of which is summarised at [45] and following above. Importantly, Dr O’Dea made the point that although schizophrenic symptoms might, over a period of time, be seen to fluctuate in terms of their severity, a person with a schizophrenic illness is “very unwell through the whole process”.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt took the view that at the time of the offending, the accused was experiencing a state of mind that had the capacity to impact, to a substantial degree, upon his understanding of events and importantly, upon his capacity to know right from wrong.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt acknowledged that the present case was, from a psychiatric perspective, a difficult one. He explained that such difficulty arose, at least in part, from the fact that there was some evidence which supported the view that the accused felt threatened by the deceased’s actions “for real reasons”, rather than because of a delusional belief. However, he expressed the view that one particular factor which supported the existence of a defence of mental illness was the accused’s apparent sense that his actions in killing the deceased were somehow justified. He explained that justification which is derived from a delusional belief is an irrational justification, and one which interferes with the person’s ability to reason about the wrongfulness of his or her act. Ultimately, and despite his acknowledgement that the case was a difficult one, Dr Allnutt concluded that a defence of mental illness was open.
	
	
	In my view, the opinions of Dr O’Dea and Dr Allnutt provide clear support for the conclusion that a defence of mental illness is made out. I accept their opinions that the accused was suffering from a schizophrenic disorder at the time of killing the deceased. Clearly, that is a disease of the mind. Accepting the opinions of Dr O’Dea and Dr Allnutt, that disease of the mind gave rise to a defect of reason on the part of the accused, which resulted in the accused not knowing that what he was doing was wrong, having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people. For the reasons explained by Dr Allnutt, the accused’s evidence that he was “normal” at the time should be rejected.
	
	
	If medical evidence as to an accused’s mental illness is unanimous, it cannot be rejected by a tribunal of fact in the absence of other material which casts some doubt on it: R v Afele [2014] NSWSC 366 at [68] and the authorities cited therein. The opinions of Dr O’Dea and Dr Allnutt, both as to the nature of the accused’s underlying mental illness and its effect on his actions in stabbing the deceased, are consistent. However, the opinion of Dr Zinatsa (set out at [36]-[37] above) is to the contrary. In those circumstances, the expert evidence could not be said to be unanimous. However, neither the Crown nor counsel for the accused submitted that I should accept the opinion of Dr Zinatsa over the opinions of Dr O’Dea and Dr Allnutt as to the accused’s mental state at the time of his offending. Dr Allnutt gave evidence (commencing at T178 L20) that although he had regard to Dr Zinatsa’s opinion, he concluded that the accused was mentally ill at the time of his offending. Importantly, in reference to Dr Zinatsa’s opinion, Dr Allnutt said (commencing a T178 L30):
	


“That document is about eight lines. I don't know the I first of all don't know the doctor's qualifications. There's no evidence of the quality of the assessment, what he asked for. And I've also, in my experience, it's not uncommon for, at this stage, where one's had the opportunity to look at everything, to disagree with what might have been a cross section of assessment done in a busy outpatient unit or a busy ED at the material time.

Interestingly enough, on the DVD, he doesn't manifest overt symptoms of mental illness either in his interaction with police and that's probably what the doctor saw. But I don't think the doctor had the entire brief in order to have all the information that was available to him that's been available to us so this is an on balance opinion, looking at everything”.


	
	The evidence indicates that Dr Zinatsa is in fact a Psychiatric Registrar. There is therefore no doubt that he was appropriately qualified to express the opinions set out in his report. However, as Dr Allnutt pointed out, there is no evidence at all as to the nature and extent of Dr Zinatsa’s assessment of the accused. What is clear is that unlike Dr Zinatsa, both Dr Allnutt and Dr O’Dea had a substantial amount of documentary material available to them to assist in forming an opinion as to the accused’s mental state at the time of killing the deceased. It is clear that Dr Zinatsa did not have that material. It is also clear that, as one might expect, both Dr Allnutt and Dr O’Dea placed significant weight on that material in reaching their conclusions.
	
	
	In these circumstances, I regard the opinions of Dr Allnutt and Dr O’Dea to be substantially more reliable, and deserving of far greater weight, than that of Dr Zinatsa. I do not accept the opinion of Dr Zinatsa that at the time of his examination the accused was neither mentally ill nor mentally disordered.
	
	
	It should also be noted, bearing in mind my observations in [103] above, that I invited both the Crown and counsel for the accused to draw my attention to any evidence which might cast some doubt upon the reliability of the opinions of Dr O’Dea and Dr Allnutt. Counsel for the accused did not point to any such evidence. The Crown faintly submitted that it would be open to me to conclude from the CCTV footage that the accused gave the impression of “acting normally” before he stabbed the deceased and that he was “coherent and descriptive” when later speaking to the police. However the Crown accepted that Dr Allnutt had specifically alluded to the fact that a person suffering from schizophrenia may appear objectively “normal”. Ultimately, the Crown accepted that in terms of the defence of mental illness there was not “a lot of scope” to go beyond the expert evidence.
	
	
	For all of these reasons I am satisfied that the accused was suffering from a schizophrenic illness at the time of stabbing the deceased, which resulted in his not knowing that what he was doing was wrong. I am therefore satisfied that a defence of mental illness is established. In these circumstances it is not necessary for me to consider any of the remaining issues which were foreshadowed.
	
	
	I am conscious of the fact that the members of the deceased’s family suffered a sudden and indescribable loss on the morning of 13 March 2014. Some of them have been present in Court during the course of the trial and have heard and seen parts of the evidence as it has been given. I am hopeful that the conclusion of these proceedings may assist in bringing them some degree of closure, and I extend the sincere sympathy of the Court to each of them.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	For the reasons expressed, my findings and orders are as follows:
	



	
	I find the accused not guilty of the murder of Visakesvaran Velupillai on the grounds of mental illness.
	
	
	I order that the accused be detained, pursuant to s. 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, in an appropriate correctional centre, or in such facility as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may determine, until he is released by due process of law.
	
	
	I direct the Registrar to notify the Minister for Health, and the Mental Health Review Tribunal, of these orders.

2768044,ARMSTRONG v REGINA [2015] NSWCCA 273,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: Paul Darcey Armstrong (the applicant) pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Felipe Flores (the deceased) on 2 September 1991. The basis for liability for manslaughter, as distinct from murder, was provocation.
	
	
	On 30 May 2014, the sentencing judge sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 13 years and 3 months, commencing on 21 October 2012, with a non-parole period of 9 years and 11 months. The earliest date upon which the applicant was eligible for release on parole was to be 20 September 2022, whilst the balance of the term was to expire on 20 January 2026.
	


Factual background


	
	The summary below is taken from the statement of agreed facts tendered at the sentencing hearing, supplemented by the findings of the sentencing judge in R v Armstrong [2014] NSWSC 700 (Sentencing Judgment). Neither party disputed these findings.
	
	
	The deceased was a homosexual male who had the HIV virus. He was known to frequent gay nightclubs and establishments in the Darlinghurst area.
	
	
	Shortly after midnight on 2 September 1991, the deceased went to the Exchange Hotel on Oxford Street, Darlinghurst. He was observed to be intoxicated. While there, he met the applicant, a male, who was taller than 185 cm and of a solid muscular build. They agreed to have sex.
	
	
	After leaving the Exchange Hotel, the applicant drove the deceased to a secluded spot at Lincoln Crescent, Woolloomooloo. There, oral sex took place, during which the deceased’s trousers and underpants were lowered. During or after oral sex, the deceased told the applicant that he was HIV positive. At the time the applicant had a fear of contracting HIV. As a result of what was said and due to concern as to the possibility of contracting HIV, the applicant lost control. The applicant violently assaulted the deceased and inflicted fatal injuries on him.
	
	
	A post mortem examination revealed that the deceased had suffered severe internal injuries. These included three fractured ribs on the right side and two on the left side and a large laceration extending between both atria of the heart. There was a large laceration to the liver, which almost split the liver in half, bruising to the spleen, extensive bruising to the scrotum and a laceration in the groin area. There was also an impression made on the deceased’s face, believed to be a shoe print.
	
	
	The sentencing judge noted that the Crown accepted that the applicant’s loss of control was induced by the deceased telling him that he had the HIV virus. She also noted that the Crown accepted that, taking into account the community concern in 1991 about contracting HIV, this could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the applicant to have so far lost control as to have formed an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	After the assault, the applicant dragged the deceased, still undressed, to a dark place in the area. The sentencing judge found that he did this so that the deceased would not be discovered in sufficient time for the assault to be associated with the applicant. She found that by the time that the applicant had dragged the deceased, the applicant had regained control. She found that he dragged the deceased “in order to reduce the prospects of his involvement being revealed by his proximity to the scene, delay the discovery of Mr Flores and to remove any chance that his life could be saved”: Sentencing Judgment at [109].
	


The events leading up to the plea of guilty to manslaughter


	
	The applicant was first interviewed in connection with the killing on 4 December 2008, following which he was arrested. He stood trial and was convicted of murder. On 12 August 2010, he was sentenced by Buddin J to a total term of 17 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years and 6 months, commencing 4 December 2008. The total term was to expire on 3 December 2025 and the applicant was to be eligible for release on parole on 3 June 2020: R v Armstrong [2010] NSWSC 800.
	
	
	The applicant also stood trial and was convicted in the District Court of two unrelated counts of sexual intercourse without consent. He was sentenced for this offence by Murrell DCJ (as her Honour then was) on 13 August 2010, the day following his sentence for murder. There is some disparity between the sentence as recorded in her Honour’s remarks on sentence and that recorded on JusticeLink. In respect of Count 2, the remarks by her Honour recorded a sentence for a fixed term of 2 years and 6 months, commencing on 20 July 2018 and expiring on 19 January 2021. In respect of Count 1, her Honour’s remarks on sentence recorded a head sentence of 5 years 10 months and 15 days, commencing on 20 January 2019 and expiring on 3 June 2024, with a non-parole period of 3 years 10 months and 15 days, expiring on 3 June 2022. The overall sentence was thus for a term of 5 years 10 months and 15 days, commencing on 20 July 2018, the applicant being eligible for parole on 3 June 2022 and the overall term expiring on 3 June 2024.
	
	
	By contrast, the entry in JusticeLink records a sentence on Count 2 of a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months, commencing on 7 June 2018 and expiring on 6 December 2020. In respect of Count 1, the entry records a head sentence of 4 years 10 months and 17 days, commencing on 6 June 2019 and expiring on 22 April 2024, with a non-parole period of 2 years 10 months and 17 days, expiring on 22 April 2022. The overall sentence was thus 5 years 10 months and 17 days, commencing on 7 June 2018 and expiring on 22 April 2024, the applicant being eligible for parole on 22 April 2022.
	
	
	Whichever version of the sentence imposed by Murrell DCJ is correct, it can be seen that the sentence on Count 1 was to be served entirely concurrently with the non-parole period fixed by Buddin J for the sentence for murder, while that for Count 2, partly concurrently with that non-parole period and wholly concurrently with the head sentence. The end result was that, as a result of the sentences imposed by each of Buddin J and Murrell DCJ, the applicant was sentenced to a total term of 17 years expiring on 3 December 2025 and was first eligible for parole on either 22 April 2022 or 3 June 2022, depending on whether the sentence recorded in the remarks on sentence or that contained in JusticeLink was actually imposed by Murrell DCJ.
	
	
	The applicant appealed against his conviction for murder. His appeal was upheld and a new trial ordered. In consequence, the Court of Criminal Appeal revised the sentences imposed for the sexual assault offences: Paul Darcey Armstrong [2013] NSWCCA 137. The fixed term of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment for Count 2 was stated to commence on 4 December 2008 and expire on 3 June 2011. The sentence of 4 years 10 months and 17 days imprisonment imposed for Count 1 was stated to commence on 4 December 2009, with a non-parole period of 2 years 10 months and 17 days, expiring on 20 October 2012, the balance of term expiring on 20 October 2014. Thus, when the sentencing judge came to impose the sentence, she noted that the applicant was sentenced in respect of the sexual offences to an overall term of imprisonment commencing on 4 December 2008, expiring on 20 October 2014, with a non-parole period expiring on 20 October 2012.
	
	
	I have recorded the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge in par [2] above. The effect of her Honour’s orders was to accumulate the whole of the sentence for manslaughter on the non-parole period for the sexual offences. The net result was that (assuming that the sentence of Murrell DCJ as recorded on JusticeLink was correct), while when the applicant stood convicted of both murder and the sexual offences, he was eligible for parole on 22 April 2022, he is now eligible for parole on 20 September 2022. Further, while his sentence for murder would have expired on 3 December 2025, his sentence for manslaughter now expires on 20 January 2026.
	


The remarks on sentence


	
	Neither the factual findings made by the sentencing judge, her Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence, nor her assessment of the subjective circumstances of the applicant, were challenged on this application. It is thus necessary to do no more than set out her conclusions in summary form.
	
	
	Her Honour set out the circumstances in which the offence occurred in the manner I have described above. Her Honour noted that the principal disputed fact at the sentencing hearing was whether, as the Crown contended, the applicant appreciated that he had killed the deceased at the time, or shortly after, his death, or, as the applicant contended, he only appreciated this in December 2008, when he was questioned by the police.
	
	
	The sentencing judge described the applicant as an “unsatisfactory witness” whose evidence she could not accept unless corroborated: Sentencing Judgment at [83]-[84]. She rejected his evidence that he did not know that the deceased had died in 1991, but rather found that the applicant had concluded that he had got away with killing the deceased, whose death could be attributed to so-called “gay bashings” at the time. The sentencing judge did not accept that the deceased was capable of struggling with the applicant, or that he caused the applicant any injury. The sentencing judge pointed to the fact that the maximum penalty for the offence was 25 years and that there was no standard non-parole period. Her Honour noted that the applicant made no inquiry of the deceased as to whether he was HIV positive prior to having sex with him. She rejected his evidence that there was a convention as a result of which the applicant assumed that, if the deceased was infected with the virus, he would have informed the applicant as a matter of courtesy.
	
	
	Her Honour stated that she regarded the manslaughter as objectively very serious, being “a brutal and savage attack by a large, strong man against a relatively diminutive weaker man”: Sentencing Judgment at [111]. She stated that she did not regard the provocation as particularly great and she described the applicant’s conduct after the crime as both “callous and selfish”: Sentencing Judgment at [113].
	
	
	Considering the appropriate sentence, the sentencing judge noted that the crime was a historic crime, having been committed in 1991. She concluded, however, that sentencing practice for the offence of manslaughter had not moved adversely to the applicant since that time.
	
	
	The sentencing judge noted the sentences imposed by Buddin J and Murrell DCJ, as varied by the Court of Criminal Appeal. She concluded that it was not appropriate to backdate the sentence for manslaughter to a date earlier than the expiration of the non-parole period for the sexual offences, as there was entirely separate criminality between the manslaughter and the sexual offences. She concluded that the principle of totality did not require any part of the sentence to be served concurrently with the non-parole period for the sexual offences.
	
	
	Her Honour found that the applicant did not demonstrate any remorse for his crime. In relation to his subjective circumstances, she noted that he was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1995 and that he was on anti-retroviral medication. She noted that he had been assaulted in gaol, as a result of which he had reduced vision in his left eye. She noted that he had lost contact with his family since being in gaol.
	
	
	The sentencing judge referred to a psychologist’s report of a Ms Amber Duffy, in which, she stated, the applicant was found to have avoidant, schizoid, masochistic (self-defeating), dependent and anti-social traits. She noted that the report said that he suffered substantial anxiety, but had been reluctant to seek counselling whilst in custody.
	
	
	The sentencing judge noted that the applicant’s prior convictions did not entitle him to any leniency. She also rejected the proposition that he had good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	So far as a discount for the plea of guilty was concerned, her Honour noted that a four week trial had been avoided. However, she pointed out that the applicant was aware of the advantage of a plea to manslaughter when charged with murder. She noted that, in these circumstances, he pleaded at the last possible opportunity. In those circumstances, she was only prepared to allow a discount of 5%.
	
	
	The sentencing judge declined to find special circumstances arising out of the fact that the applicant had been in prison since 4 December 2008. She repeated her view that the sentence should stand apart from and not be affected by the sentences imposed for the sexual offences. In that context, her Honour made the following remarks:
	


“[143]   I note that it is implicit in the variation by the Court of Criminal Appeal of the sentence for the sex offences that Buddin J was satisfied that there were special circumstances. It was not submitted that I was bound by that finding. Indeed, as I indicated to the parties, I have not considered Buddin J's remarks on sentence lest I be influenced by the factual substratum of the trial which was necessarily different from the Agreed Facts and evidence before me. I do not regard the sentence imposed by Buddin J, which was set aside when the conviction was quashed, as having any bearing on the exercise of my sentencing discretion.”

The grounds of appeal


	
	The applicant relied on the following ground of appeal:
	


“1.   Her Honour failed to take into account a relevant consideration; namely one or more of the following:

a)   The sentence imposed upon the applicant by Buddin J (R v Armstrong [2010] NSWSC 800),

b)   The sentence imposed upon the applicant by Murrell DCJ on 13 August 2010 (as set out in, and varied by, this Court in Armstrong v R [2013] NSWCCA 137), and/or

c)   The total effective sentence and total effective non-parole period faced by the applicant, as a result of the sentences imposed upon by Buddin J and Murrell DCJ, prior to the quashing of his murder conviction by this Court.”

The parties’ submissions


	
	The applicant relied on what he described as the basic principle that ordinarily the sentences imposed in a first trial should be regarded as the upper limit of the sentence to be imposed following an appeal and second trial, otherwise the offender will be seen to have been worse off as a result of having brought a successful appeal against conviction. This is described as the ‘ceiling’ principle.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that exceptions to the principle were rare and needed to be clearly articulated in the reasons of the second sentencing judge. He submitted that exceptions most commonly arose if the view was formed that the earlier sentence was manifestly inadequate or where there was materially different information before the second judge as compared to the first. The applicant submitted that in the present case, there was no suggestion of any error in the approach taken to sentencing by Buddin J or Murrell DCJ.
	
	
	There was some debate between the parties as to the extent that the principle was or should have been drawn to the attention of the primary judge and the extent that her Honour took it into account. The applicant acknowledged that neither the principle, nor the cases which supported it, were articulated in the submissions before the sentencing judge. However, he pointed to the context in which that occurred, in particular, that it was self-evident that a conviction of manslaughter should lead to a lesser sentence than that for murder arising out of the same circumstances. Further, the applicant noted that it was in fact submitted before the sentencing judge that the applicant should be entitled to retain the benefit of some concurrency and not lose that benefit as a consequence of running his appeal and retrial. The applicant also noted the response of the sentencing judge that the applicant had received “an enormous benefit in that he had the opportunity to plead guilty to manslaughter”. The applicant also pointed to the fact that material supplied to the sentencing judge demonstrated that sentences for manslaughter, generally speaking, were manifestly less than that imposed in the present case. Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that, in those circumstances, it was unsurprising that the principle was not raised and that it was acknowledged that there may need to be some lessening of concurrency.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the fact that the sentences imposed by Buddin J and Murrell DCJ were before the sentencing judge, that neither party had sought to place before her Honour the remarks on sentence of either of them and that neither party sought to have her Honour read the remarks on sentence of Buddin J or the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on appeal, although she indicated that she would do so if requested. Senior counsel for the Crown, however, fairly acknowledged that as the sentencing judge was aware that the sentence for manslaughter would be significantly less than that imposed for murder, it was understandable why the ceiling principle was not the focus of the sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	Senior Counsel for the applicant submitted that the obvious fact which required application of the basic principle was that the sentencing judge was not concerned with the offence of murder. She submitted that the application of the principle was further supported by the principle of equal justice.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that, in considering the principle, it needed to be recognised that there was more involved in a sentence than the head sentence. She submitted that all components of the sentence imposed by Buddin J needed to be taken into account, including the total sentence, the minimum period to be spent in custody and the extent to which service of the sentence was ameliorated by being made concurrent with other sentences. She submitted that unless the sentencing judge came to the view that the sentence she was to impose for manslaughter would be manifestly inadequate if made concurrent, in the order of about 2 years, the previous concurrency ought to be preserved.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that in sentencing, one of the factors required to be taken into account, in an ameliorative way, was the existence of the sentencing regime prior to the appeal. She drew an analogy with a situation of parity, submitting that the same principle of equal justice which required parity to be taken into account in the case of co-offenders should be applied in the present case.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the applicant also drew on the principle of totality, pointing to the fact that the total criminality “was less in a meaningful way than the total criminality the applicant was to be sentenced for prior to the appeal”.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the applicant submitted, referring to the paragraph in the remarks on sentence to which I have referred to in par [26] above, that it was clear that the sentencing judge did not regard the sentence imposed by Buddin J as having any bearing on her sentencing discretion. She submitted that although the statement was made when dealing with the issue of special circumstances, it was a clear statement of broad application, especially given that her Honour did not clearly state otherwise why she did not take the principle into account.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the remarks of the sentencing judge, to which I have referred in par [26] above, were confined to the consideration of special circumstances and were not a general statement that no regard would be paid to the prior sentence. The Crown pointed to the fact that the sentence imposed was significantly less than that imposed by Buddin J for murder and did not of itself offend the ‘ceiling’ principle.
	
	
	The Crown pointed out that the sentencing judge gave consideration to the question of concurrency submitting that that demonstrated that she was cognisant of the degree of overlap between the two sentences. It was pointed out that the sentencing judge specifically addressed the reason why she was taking a different approach to totality than that taken by Murrell DCJ.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was questionable, in the current circumstances, where the applicant was convicted of an entirely separate offence following the appeal, whether the ceiling principle would apply. The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge was obliged to give effect to her own assessment of totality and that she gave specific reasons for the course that she took.
	
	
	In support of the proposition that the ceiling principle did not apply in the particular circumstances of the present case, counsel for the Crown submitted that Murrell DCJ was sentencing “on the back of a lengthy murder sentence”, in contrast to the position as it emerged before the sentencing judge.
	


Consideration


	
	What has been described as the ‘ceiling’ principle in cases of conviction following a retrial, consequent upon a successful appeal, is well established. It was stated by Street CJ in R v Gilmore (1979) 1 A Crim R 416 (Gilmore) in the following terms (at 419-420):
	


“It is a sound principle of sentencing that, on a new trial consequent upon the quashing of a conviction by the Court of Criminal Appeal, the accused should ordinarily not receive a longer sentence or non-parole period than those following upon the first trial. The application of this ordinary principle will, of course, necessarily yield in relation to the non-parole period if there is some significant subsequent circumstance to be taken into account. For example, an escape from custody pending the new trial or the committing of other offences whilst on bail, resulting in either case in the imposition of a sentence prior to the new trial itself, would have a direct significance upon the non-parole period to be specified if the new trial results in a conviction. But, so far as concerns the head sentence, that passed on the first trial should ordinarily not be exceeded if the new trial results in conviction again.

…

The policy consideration underlying the specification of the upper limit on the sentence is twofold. In the first place, a person whose conviction is tainted in that the first trial was defective to an extent not capable of being saved by the proviso, should not, in fairness, be required to run any risk of suffering a heavier sentence on a new trial as a consequence of exposing on appeal the defective nature of the first trial. It is in the public interest in ensuring orderly and proper administration of the criminal law that defects in trials should be challenged and laid bare on appeal. As a corollary to this, it is wrong that any person should suffer ill-founded criminal judgment in consequence of a defective trial, and feel constrained to avoid exposing that defect lest on a new trial a heavier sentence be passed.”


	
	Subsequently, in R v Bedford (1985) 5 NSWLR 711 (Bedford), Street CJ seemed to modify the principle to some extent. His Honour described it as a prima facie approach and, if a judge considers that a longer sentence is appropriate, he or she is obliged to give effect to his or her views. It was emphasised, however, that if this course was to be adopted, the judge should give a specific indication of the reasons as to why it was considered appropriate: Bedford at 714.
	
	
	The principle was considered by the High Court in R H McL v The Queen [2000] HCA 46; 203 CLR 452 (McL). Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Callinan JJ made the following remarks concerning the principle:
	


“[23]   The process of discretionary reasoning appearing in the above passage involved no error of principle. In the course of argument in this Court, references were made, not by counsel, but by members of the Court, to the decision in R v Gilmore in which Street CJ referred to a consideration which a judge, re-sentencing after a second trial an offender who had earlier appealed successfully against the conviction at a first trial, ought to take into account. In brief, in the absence of countervailing considerations, the sentences imposed following the first trial should be regarded as the upper limit of the sentence to be imposed following the second trial, otherwise an offender will be seen to have been worse off as a result of having brought a successful appeal against a conviction.” [internal citations omitted]

McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ described the application of the principle as follows:

“[72]   If the appellant is convicted on any count at the re-trial, the sentencing judge will also have to take into account another important factor in the sentencing process. Ordinarily but not invariably, a successful appellant should not receive a longer sentence after conviction on a re-trial than he or she received at the original trial. If the sentencing judge at the re-trial thinks that the original sentence was manifestly inadequate, it is open to that judge in the exercise of the sentencing discretion to give a sentence higher than that imposed on the first occasion. But an exercise of discretion by a sentencing judge that increases the original sentence given to the accused is necessarily rare. That is because such an increase may be perceived, by the public and the accused, as containing a retributive element imposed because the accused had successfully appealed against his or her earlier conviction or sentence. If the raising of a sentence after a successful appeal became common, it might discourage appeals. Such a result would be contrary to the public interest, for an organised society has a vital interest in the proper administration of its criminal justice system. Rights of appeal are an important means of preventing the perpetuation of error in criminal trials.”


	
	As the applicant pointed out, in the present case, there was no suggestion that the sentences imposed by Buddin J or Murrell DCJ, including the structure of the sentence imposed by Murrell DCJ, were manifestly inadequate or for that matter, infected by error.
	
	
	In Tarrant v R [2007] NSWCCA 124; 171 A Crim R 425 (Tarrant), after reviewing the authorities, the Court stated (at [30]) that there was force in the proposition that Street CJ in Bedford watered down his statement of principle in Gilmore. The Court observed, however, that the observations of the High Court in McL appeared to have “restored Gilmore to prominence as an expression of the rationale of this approach to sentencing”: Tarrant at [30]. The Court emphasised that a “judge at a second trial need not perpetuate a sentence which is manifestly inadequate” or may “pass a heavier sentence if he or she makes [different] findings of fact … from those made by the judge at the first trial”: Tarrant at [31].
	
	
	The application of the principle is relatively straightforward when the second sentence is for the same offence as that for which the offender was originally sentenced. When that is not the case, it is more complex. Thus, in Bedford, the offender had been convicted of offences against two victims. In respect of the first victim, he was sentenced to an aggregate of 6½ years, in respect of the second, to a cumulative 3½ years, making a total of 10 years with a non-parole period of 5 years being specified. Following successful appeals against conviction, he was retried on the first offence and sentenced to 6½ years, with a non-parole period of 3 years. On appeal, it was argued that the offender should be entitled to the benefit of 7½ months served by him which was exclusively referable to the sentence imposed at the first trial, in accordance with the principles in Gilmore. The argument was rejected, Street CJ stating (at 714) that some consideration must have been given at the first trial to the principle of totality in fixing the individual sentences. In those circumstances, he concluded that the applicant was no worse off.
	
	
	A similar situation arose in R v MM [2002] NSWCCA 431; 135 A Crim R 216. At the first trial, the applicant was convicted and sentenced in respect of 14 offences. Following a successful appeal, he was retried and convicted of 11 of the same charged 14 offences and acquitted of three. The same overall sentence was imposed. In rejecting an appeal on the ground that this amounted to an effective increase in sentence, without good reason being demonstrated, the Court explained (at [16]) that it was important for the sentencing judge to have particular regard to totality and the overall requirement that the sentence reflect the objective seriousness of the offences. The Court also emphasised (at [30]) the independent sentencing discretion of the second sentencing judge.
	
	
	None of the cases to which I have referred above dealt with a situation where the offender was convicted of a lesser offence following a successful appeal against conviction, nor where, following his or her first conviction, another judge had imposed sentences for different offences. The former matter was considered in R v Mitchell [2002] NSWCCA 380 (Mitchell). Following a trial, the applicant was convicted of 3 offences, kidnapping, sexual assault and common assault. For the kidnapping, he was sentenced to 6½ years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4½ years. For the sexual and common assault offences, he was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of 3 years and 6 months, respectively.
	
	
	Following an appeal, the convictions were quashed and a retrial was ordered. Thereafter, the applicant agreed to plead guilty to all of the charges other than the charge of kidnapping. The sentencing judge imposed the penalty originally given for the kidnapping offence for the sexual assault offence. The Court held that the sentencing judge erred in adopting this approach. The Court indicated that “the applicant would have been entitled to expect that had he gone to trial for the offences for which he had originally been tried …and had he been convicted of those offences, he would have received no more than the sentence imposed initially upon him”: Mitchell at [22]. However, the Court found that as a result of the sentence imposed by the second sentencing judge, he in effect received the same sentence imposed on him in the first trial, less a discount for a plea of guilty. However, the Court varied the sentence for the sexual assault offence to a period of 4 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months, a somewhat greater sentence than that originally given for that offence.
	
	
	The circumstances of the present case are different to any of the cases to which I have referred. First, it must be remembered that the sentence imposed for manslaughter of 13 years and 3 months (approximately 13 years and 11 months prior to the 5% discount for the plea), was less than the offence imposed for murder, as was the non-parole period (see par [10] above).
	
	
	Further, the sexual offences were entirely unrelated offences. In the instant case, apart from the ceiling principle, the only basis on which it could be concluded the sentences were to be served wholly or partly concurrently, would be by application of the principle of totality, to ensure that the sentence was just and appropriate, reflecting the overall criminality and avoiding a crushing sentence: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59 at 63; Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 304, 308; Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610.
	
	
	In the present case, it was not suggested that, apart from the failure to apply the ceiling principle, the sentencing judge erred in considering questions of totality or the extent to which the sentence should be served concurrently. However, the sentence for manslaughter was heavy and the failure to apply the principle, in my opinion, cannot be explained by the fact that because a lesser overall sentence for manslaughter was imposed, there was no need for any concurrence with the second offence.
	
	
	Further and importantly, contrary to what was stated in Bedford, the sentencing judge gave no reasons for failing to consider the principle. Indeed, having regard to the passage from her judgment set out in par [26] above, she appeared to regard the earlier sentences as irrelevant. In my respectful submission, in these circumstances, her Honour fell into error.
	
	
	Thus, it is necessary to resentence the applicant. Although the applicant at one point in his submissions suggested that the error could simply be rectified by re-establishing the earlier concurrency, in my opinion, that is not permitted by the authorities. Rather, the appellate court is required to exercise its independent discretion in resentencing the applicant: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at [42].
	
	
	However, the resentencing exercise in this case is simplified by the fact that the circumstance of the offence, as recorded by the sentencing judge, her analysis of the objective seriousness of the offence and her consideration of the subjective circumstances of the applicant, have not been disputed. I have summarised these matters above, taking into account what her Honour said in respect of each of them.
	
	
	Although the Court was provided with some statistics concerning sentences for manslaughter, I do not consider them to be of much assistance having regard to the wide variety of circumstances in which this crime can be committed. As her Honour said, the maximum sentence is 25 years and this offence was objectively serious. I agree with the sentencing judge that it is not possible to conclude that the applicant has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	In relation to the discount for the plea, I would give a somewhat higher discount than that given by the sentencing judge. The plea did avoid a four week trial and it was by no means clear that the Crown would have accepted the plea had it been offered prior to the original conviction being overturned. I would regard 10% as an appropriate discount.
	
	
	Taking these matters into account, as well as the subjective circumstances referred to by the sentencing judge, I would impose a total sentence of 12 years and 3 months. Like her Honour, I am unable to find special circumstances, so I would impose a non-parole period of 9 years and 2 months.
	
	
	If the sentence was accumulated on the non-parole period for the sexual offences, the earliest date that the applicant would be eligible to be released would be 19 December 2021. This does not seem to me to give adequate weight to the ceiling principle, particularly having regard to the fact that the plea of guilty was to a lesser offence than that for which the applicant was originally convicted. There should be a degree of concurrence.
	
	
	I would sentence the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 12 years 3 months, commencing on 20 March 2012, with a non-parole period of 9 years and 2 months. The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible to be released on parole is 19 May 2021 and the sentence will expire on 19 June 2024.
	
	
	In the result, I would make the following orders:
	



	
	Grant the applicant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Allow the appeal.
	
	
	Set aside the sentence imposed on the applicant and, in lieu thereof, make the following orders:
	



	
	The applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 years and 3 months, commencing on 20 March 2012, with a non-parole period of 9 years and 2 months.
	
	
	The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for parole is 19 May 2021.
	



	
	PRICE J: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of the Chief Justice and the note of agreement from Beech-Jones J.
	
	
	It is regrettable that neither the Crown nor counsel for the applicant drew the ceiling principle, nor the cases that supported it, to the attention of the sentencing judge. Whilst in submissions to this Court, Senior Counsel submitted that it was unsurprising that the ceiling principle was not raised particularly as it was “self-evident” that a conviction for manslaughter should lead to a lesser sentence than that for murder, the Chief Justice’s judgment demonstrates that the application of the ceiling principle in the circumstances of her Honour’s sentencing task was not without difficulty.
	
	
	The assistance provided by the Crown, and counsel for the applicant, fell short of the help that her Honour could otherwise have reasonably expected. Neither counsel who appeared on the appeal appeared at the trial
	
	
	I agree with the Chief Justice and the orders proposed.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: I agree with the Chief Justice and the orders he proposes. In particular I agree that the “ceiling principle” described by the Chief Justice applies to the circumstance of a person being sentenced for manslaughter when they have previously been convicted and sentenced for murder in respect of the death of the same person. I also agree that its proper application requires a consideration of not just the overall length of a sentence but all the components of the sentence including its commencement date relative to other sentences so as to avoid a person effectively being punished for mounting a successful appeal.

2768060,Z v R [2015] NSWCCA 274,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: I agree with Wilson J.
	
	
	WILSON J: This is an application pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by her Honour Judge Woodburne SC in the District Court at Sydney on 16 December 2014.
	
	
	Her Honour sentenced the applicant in relation to two related sets of offences. The first offence in time related to the shooting of a man at Doonside on 29 November 2010 (“the shooting offence”); the second set of offences concerned three firearm offences.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded not guilty in relation to the shooting offence. His trial with respect to that matter commenced on 18 March 2014. On 4 April 2014 the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder, but guilty of an alternative charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to do so.
	
	
	The offence, which is contrary to s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900, occurred in the context of a dispute between members of rival criminal gangs. On 29 November 2010, the applicant, at that time a member of an Outlaw Motorcycle Gang (OMCG), went to the residence of a member of another rival criminal organisation, and shot the victim, AB (a pseudonym), twice, causing him serious injury.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for an offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to do so is 25 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 7 years is specified in the Table to Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the CSP Act”).
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to the three firearm offences on 17 April 2013, two days after his trial for those offences had been due to commence.
	
	
	There were two counts of selling a pistol or prohibited firearm contrary to s 51(1A) of the Firearms Act 1996. Such an offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment; a standard non-parole period of 10 years is specified in the Table to Division 1A of Part 4 of the CSP Act. The firearms involved were a .45 calibre Sig Sauer P220 self-loading pistol, and a 9mm Parabellum calibre sub-machine gun. Each was sold to an individual who was not authorised by licence to possess it.
	
	
	The third offence was one of possession of a prohibited firearm, it being a shortened .357 Magnum revolving cylinder fire rifle, without being authorised by licence to do so. That offence, contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment; a standard non-parole period of 3 years applied at the relevant time, in January 2011.
	
	
	In sentencing the applicant on 16 December 2014, the sentencing judge took into account assistance provided to the authorities by him, pursuant to s 23 of the CSP Act, and to the pleas of guilty which had been entered. The result was that her Honour awarded the applicant a combined discount of 50% on the sentences that would otherwise have been imposed for the four offences, including relevant to the s 33 offence, even though that matter went to trial.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced as follows:
	



	
	For the possession of the firearm: a non-parole period of 2 years and 7 months imprisonment to date from 18 January 2011 (the date of his arrest) and to expire on 17 August 2013, with an additional term of 1 year and 5 months to date from 18 August 2013 and expiring on 17 January 2015, the total term being one of 4 years imprisonment;
	
	
	For the selling of the Sig Sauer pistol: a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months imprisonment to date from 18 January 2012 and expiring on 17 April 2015, with an additional term of 1 year and 9 months to date from 18 April 2015 and expiring on 17 January 2017, the total term being one of 5 years;
	
	
	For the second of the offences of selling a firearm, being the sub-machine gun: a non-parole period of 3 years and 10 months imprisonment to date from 18 January 2013 and expiring on 17 November 2016, with an additional term of 2 years and 2 months to date from 18 November 2016 and expiring on 17 January 2019, the total term being one of 5 years imprisonment); and
	
	
	For the shooting offence: a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months imprisonment to date from 18 January 2015 and expiring on 17 October 2018, with an additional term of 4 years and 3 months to date from 18 October 2018 and expiring on 17 January 2023, the total term being one of 8 years imprisonment.
	



	
	The total effective sentence was a non-parole period of 7 years and 9 months imprisonment to date from 18 January 2011 and expiring on 17 October 2018, with an additional term of 4 years and 3 months to date from 18 October 2018, expiring on 17 January 2023, making an overall head sentence of 12 years imprisonment.
	
	
	On 18 December 2014 the applicant lodged a Notice of Intention to Appeal Against Sentence. His Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal and Grounds of Appeal were filed on 17 June 2015, within the available period.
	


The Proceedings in the District Court


	
	As noted, the applicant was convicted of the shooting offence after trial; he entered (very late) pleas of guilty to the firearms offences.
	
	
	Following a number of adjournments granted to the parties the sentence proceedings were heard on 28 November 2014, with her Honour imposing sentence on 16 December 2014.
	


The Facts of the Offences


	
	In relation to the shooting offence, the Crown tendered “Proposed Facts on Sentence”, facts with which the applicant took no issue. Relevant to the firearms offences an Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered. The sentencing judge found the facts of the offences to be in accordance with that evidence, as follows.
	
	
	During November 2010 there was animosity between two rival criminal gangs. At about 11 pm on 13 November 2010 police patrolling the Kings Cross area stopped a group of males wearing OMCG colours. Shortly after midnight AB was stopped and spoken to by Constable Hyde. AB was with a group of males. He was wearing the clothing of another gang. AB said he was there because had heard his rivals were in Kings Cross. AB was a member of his gang both before and after the time he was shot, being that group’s “Sergeant”.
	
	
	On 29 November 2010, the day of the shooting, AB was living with his wife and children at an address in Doonside. At around 10pm that night he went out onto his porch to smoke a cigarette and send some text messages on his mobile phone. Parked at the front of his house was a truck owned or used by him.
	
	
	From the porch, AB saw a person dressed in black and wearing a black balaclava walk out from behind the truck. This was the applicant. He approached AB and, producing a dark coloured handgun, said, ""Hey Cuz"". He walked to the top of the stairs leading to the porch and shot AB in the left thigh.
	
	
	AB fell to the surface of the porch facing away from the applicant. The applicant thereupon shot him a second time, to the back of his right thigh.
	
	
	The victim’s wife came to the door and the applicant ran off towards a dark coloured car waiting a short distance down the road. Someone telephoned Triple 0, with the call logged at 10.13pm.
	
	
	Police and an ambulance arrived. AB was taken to Westmead Hospital. He was found to have two bullet entry wounds, in each of his left and right thigh. There were associated fractures to the left femur and left lower pelvis, and two penetrating wounds to the upper rectum. A bullet was found lodged in his pelvis and another was near the left lower region of the spine. The bullets were surgically removed and a reversible colostomy procedure was undertaken.
	
	
	At the scene of the shooting, police located shell casings. Later inquiries of telephone call records established that, at about the time AB was shot, the applicant was in the vicinity of a call tower at Doonside. He had made calls to fellow OMCG members before and after the shooting, but his mobile telephone was not in use for about an hour around the time of the shooting.
	
	
	Between March and November 2010 the applicant had a number of discussions with an individual, named as “M”. Around November 2010 the applicant told M that he could obtain prohibited firearms, and there were a number of discussions concerning firearms.
	
	
	M later participated in a controlled operation, and was fitted with a listening device by police on those occasions when he met with the applicant.
	
	
	On 22 November 2010 M met with the applicant and arranged to purchase a pistol from him for the sum of $6,000.
	
	
	On 29 November 2010 there was another meeting about the sale of the pistol.
	
	
	On 1 December 2010 the applicant again met M and sold him a .45 calibre Sig Sauer self-loading pistol. M paid the applicant $6,000 in cash, that sum having been provided to him by police as part of the controlled operation. It had a serial number but was not registered. This was the weapon that had been used to shoot AB.
	
	
	After obtaining the pistol from the applicant M delivered it to police. The firearm was subsequently examined by ballistics experts and matched to the two projectiles that had been removed from AB’s body. M was not a person authorised to have possession of a firearm.
	
	
	In the following week M and the applicant had a number of discussions about M buying another firearm. The applicant offered to sell M an 'uzi' sub-machine pistol for $27,000.
	
	
	Each of the meetings between M and the applicant was electronically recorded pursuant to a warrant permitting the covert recordings to be made. One exchange recorded between the applicant (“A”) and M was:
	


“A: Notorious ran into one of our coffee, one of our coffee shops

M: When

A: Coffee, at Mount Druitt last night

M: They ran in

A: We got, we got the sergeant. It was, it was all on the news. We shot the sergeant.... Then we got it, until they went to the coffee shop next to the tattoo shop....who shot... to the coffee shop with baseball bats.

M: The Doonside one? Yeah?

A:...

M: Their sergeant? Fuck! And then they ran into your shop yesterday?

A: With baseball bats, the useless cunts. They just bashed the old bloke, some worker, old bloke, poor cunt, bashed the old cunt for no reason.

M: That's fuckin slack

A: That's what...

M: But brother this whole thing like why? Over money? Over power?

A: For the agg bro. Cause of that.”


	
	Newspaper reports from the time coincide with what the applicant told M.
	
	
	On 7 December 2010 M again met with the applicant. That meeting was also lawfully recorded. There was a further conversation about the shooting of the Sergeant of the rival gang, during which the applicant made a number of admissions, including that he was a member of the Milperra/Bankstown Chapter of an OMCG, that the Sergeant of the rival gang had been shot in the leg, and that a shop had been burnt down in retaliation.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the conversation the following exchange was recorded:
	


“M: Okay, hey brother. I died laughing about the guy shot in the balls. Who there..

A: He got lucky (whispering)

M: Who ... you.

A: He got he got lucky and dived behind, he dived behind the fucking wall, like he... had the wall but didn't go through

M: So what brother you got a shot at him and then what he jumped

A: No oh he.... Dived behind the door... this is the door, his leg was left outside so I sprayed it [..].”


	
	The sale of the sub machine gun by the applicant occurred on 7 December 2010. M was provided with $27,000 cash as the purchase price of the firearm. He was fitted with a listening device. Later that day the applicant went to M’s premises. He was carrying a purpose made silver case that contained a 9mm sub-machine pistol, 2 magazines with a capacity of 21 rounds, 50 rounds of 9mm ammunition, a silencer, and a fore end, that being an additional screw-in handle that allowed for two handled firing. The applicant assured M that the gun was “rapid, very rapid fire”.
	
	
	He told M not to get caught with the firearm, warning him:
	


“10 years with the silencer […] For your sake bro, cause I love you I'll tell you that”.


	
	The firearm was not registered.
	
	
	A ballistics expert who examined the firearm considered that it appeared to have been home made. It was in working order and capable of propelling projectiles in rapid succession with one depression of the trigger. The firearm is a prohibited pistol, regarded as a sub-machine pistol.
	
	
	The third firearms offence related to the applicant’s possession of a revolver.
	
	
	On 18 January 2011 the applicant met with M near Rhodes. He had a discussion with him, and then walked alone towards his car. He was arrested. On searching his car police found an object wrapped in blue fabric under the front passenger seat. It contained a fully loaded shortened .357 Magnum Uberti revolving cylinder fire rifle. The butt stock had been removed and replaced with a pistol type grip. The weapon was readily able to be concealed.
	
	
	The applicant declined to participate in a record of interview.
	
	
	On that same day a search warrant was executed at the applicant’s home in Kellyville and a number of items were located, including a quantity of black balaclavas, some black rubber gloves, items of OMCG branded clothing, and cash from the sale of the firearms to M.
	


The Seriousness of the Offences


	
	Her Honour assessed the shooting offence to be one with a very high level of objective criminality, falling towards the upper range of objective seriousness for an offence of its type.
	
	
	Significantly, the sentencing judge regarded the fact that the offence was committed in the context of organised criminal activity, with the victim targeted by virtue of his membership of a rival gang, as heightening the gravity of the applicant’s crime.
	
	
	There had been a degree of planning involved, with the victim’s home address identified, a firearm and ammunition obtained to carry out the attack, a balaclava and gloves used to disguise the applicant’s identity, and a driver utilised to speed the applicant’s get-away.
	
	
	A weapon was used and the victim was shot twice, with the second shot fired after the first had already brought him injured to the ground. The sentencing judge noted the high degree of violence involved, and observed that the use of the firearm involved a grave risk of serious injury or death.
	
	
	Her Honour referred to the nature and extent of the injuries to AB, and to the extensive medical treatment required, assessing the injuries as of a high level.
	
	
	The offence had been committed in a residential street, on the front verandah of the victim’s home, with his wife and two young children inside the house. Her Honour referred to the risk of injury to persons other than the intended victim, and to the capacity of a shooting in a public street such as this to undermine the sense of safety and security citizens are entitled to feel inside their homes.
	
	
	As to the firearms offences, her Honour noted that the sales of the two firearms were planned and considered acts designed to relieve the offender of the weapons and enrich him or his gang. Although the offender had made it known to M that he was able to supply the weapons and was well aware that M was not acquiring them as a mere curiosity without intending that they be used, her Honour concluded that the fact that the weapons were not disseminated (because of police intervention) ameliorated the gravity of the crimes.
	
	
	She regarded the sale of the pistol as falling within the mid-range of objective seriousness. The sale had been for the not insignificant sum of $6,000; the gun was not loaded (although the applicant had said he could supply ammunition for it); it had a serial number, although it was not registered. The applicant sold the firearm without regard for what use it might ultimately be put to.
	
	
	As to the second s 51(1A) offence, in relation to the sub-machine pistol, the sentencing judge concluded that it fell above the mid-range of seriousness for an offence of its type. She noted that, although the weapon appeared home-made, it was in working order and had been sold with magazines, ammunition, a silencer, and a fore end handle. Whilst the sale of the weapon was an element of the offence, her Honour referred to the large amount of money involved, it being a commercial transaction of some significance.
	
	
	The possession offence was also assessed as falling above the mid-range of seriousness for an offence of its type. Her Honour noted that the weapon was shortened and readily concealed, it was found unsecured in a motor vehicle where it was ready to hand. The gun was loaded and in working order and its presence in a car in a public street posed a risk to public safety. The context of the applicant’s possession of the weapon was relevant, that being that the applicant was a member of a criminal gang who had demonstrated his willingness to use a firearm for criminal ends.
	


The Applicant’s Subjective Case and Other Relevant Considerations


	
	The applicant did not give evidence on sentence, although he had touched on some personal matters in his evidence at trial.
	
	
	A psychiatric report from Dr Olav Nielssen was tendered to the sentencing court by the applicant, as were a number of character testimonials.
	
	
	The applicant was aged 23 at the time of the offences and 27 when he was sentenced. He was born in Northern Iran and began his schooling in that country. A promising start to his education was disrupted by revolution and war, and the applicant and his family were eventually forced to flee their homeland. The family went to Turkey, thence New Zealand (when the applicant was aged 15 years) and, finally, Australia.
	
	
	Subsequently the applicant undertook some study through TAFE and worked as a security guard and, after his security license was cancelled, in the construction industry.
	
	
	At age 21 the applicant was before the courts for offences of affray and intimidating a police officer. At 22 he was convicted of assault. The facts of those offences were before the Court and each was a serious infringement involving considerable violence or the threat of it.
	
	
	At the time of the current offences the applicant was still serving sentences related to those offences, being at liberty subject to three separate good behaviour bonds. Consistent with principle, the sentencing judge noted that the commission of the offences by the applicant in breach of conditional liberty was a matter of serious aggravation.
	
	
	Although the applicant does not drink alcohol he reported to Dr Nielssen that he has used both methylamphetamine and anabolic steroids in the past. His use of the former led to a brief admission to a psychiatric ward due to a drug induced psychosis. Dr Nielssen concluded that the applicant had a psychotic illness in remission. There were, however, no residual signs of any chronic mental illness and no ongoing treatment was indicated. There was no causal link between the illness and the offences.
	
	
	It was the applicant’s use of illicit drugs that led to his association with bikie gangs. The applicant reported that he had joined an OMCG having been attracted to the money, drugs and camaraderie made available to him by reason of his membership. He told Dr Nielssen that he had been able to leave the gang without adverse consequences.
	
	
	The applicant was spoken of highly by a former employer, and by his partner. He retained the support of his family and partner.
	
	
	Although the applicant maintained that it had not been him who shot AB, the sentencing judge was prepared to allow the applicant the benefit of a conclusion that he accepted responsibility for that and the firearms offences, and regretted the consequences of his actions.
	
	
	Her Honour found nothing in the evidence that lessened the applicant’s moral culpability for these crimes, and gave effect to principles of general deterrence and, to a degree, specific deterrence.
	
	
	She found that the applicant had taken steps towards rehabilitation, the future of which was largely dependent upon him.
	
	
	The sentencing court also took into account those matters that enlivened the operation of s 23 of the CSP Act, and the late pleas of guilty to the firearms offences.
	


The Application to this Court


	
	If granted leave, the applicant seeks to advance six grounds:
	



	
	Her Honour erred in finding that the offence committed contrary to s 33 Crimes Act 1900 was aggravated by the fact that the conduct resulted in a grave risk of death to the victim;
	
	
	Her Honour erred in finding that the offence committed contrary to s 33 Crimes Act 1900 was aggravated by the fact that the offence was committed without regard for public safety;
	
	
	In determining the objective seriousness of the offence committed contrary to s 7(1) Firearms Act 1996 her Honour erred in taking into account the applicant’s involvement in the OMCG;
	
	
	Her Honour erred in finding that the offences were aggravated by the fact that the applicant had previously been convicted of serious, personal violence offences;
	
	
	The sentence imposed upon the applicant in respect of the offence contrary to s 33 Crimes Act 1900 was manifestly excessive; and
	
	
	The overall sentence was manifestly excessive.
	


Ground 1: Her Honour erred in finding that the offence committed contrary to s 33 Crimes Act 1900 was aggravated by the fact that the conduct resulted in a grave risk of death to the victim


	
	As part of her assessment of the objective gravity of the crime of causing grievous bodily harm to AB with intent to do him grievous bodily harm, her Honour found at p 9 of her sentence judgment (“ROS”), that:
	


“The use of the firearm involved a grave risk of death to [AB], even if, as the jury found, the offender did not intend to murder [AB]. The medical evidence established that had he not been treated, his injuries would have caused serious complications or death.”


	
	Of that conclusion the applicant confidently asserts, at [6] of his written submissions (“AWS”):
	


“This reference is, of course, a reference to the aggravating feature set out in s 21A(2)(ib) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.”


	
	Section 21A(2)(ib) of the CSP Act provides for that following aggravating feature can be taken into account on sentence:
	


“the offence involved a grave risk of death to another person or persons.”


	
	Having read her Honour’s remarks, and considered the two sentences of which the applicant complains in the context of the whole, I do not share his confidence that the sentencing judge was, “of course” purporting to make a finding pursuant to s 21A(2)(ib) of the CSP Act that there was a grave risk of death, such that the gravity of the offence was aggravated.
	
	
	What the sentencing judge was plainly doing at that point in her judgment was making an assessment of the seriousness of the offence, as she was required to do prior to determining the sentence to be imposed.
	
	
	She prefaced this and other relevant findings by noting that she was obliged to determine the objective seriousness of the offence. Her Honour went on to refer to the fact that the crime was planned, that it occurred in the context of organised criminal activity, within the curtilage of a suburban home, and that a weapon was used.
	
	
	The impugned sentences followed immediately after the Court’s comments concerning those matters.
	
	
	That her Honour was doing no more than considering those features of the offence which were relevant to its gravity is clear from what was said, and the context in which it was said. The reference to the fact that there was a grave risk of death is simply a statement of fact that could likely be said of many such offences where a firearm was used and more than one shot was fired directly into a victim’s body. It did not amount to a conclusion that a statutory feature of aggravation was made out beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Indeed, the second of the two sentences relied upon by the applicant as pointing to error establishes clearly that no such error occurred. In the second sentence her Honour noted that, without the benefit of timely medical treatment, there was a grave risk of “serious complications or death”. That was very much a qualified observation. It demonstrated that, whilst the applicant’s crime was a very dangerous one, and it involved very serious risk to the victim, her Honour was not thereby concluding that the statutory feature of aggravation had been established.
	
	
	The sentencing judge nowhere referred to the statutory scheme pursuant to s 21A of the CSP Act in relation to this aspect of the matter. She did not use the word “aggravation” or make any reference to what had to be found relevant to s 21A(2)(ib) for that particular feature of aggravation to be established. In the absence of references of that kind, and in circumstances where her Honour referred equally to the risk of death and of serious medical complications, I am unable to conclude that the reference was necessarily to s 21A(2)(ib), as the applicant complains.
	
	
	Even had that been the inevitable meaning of the sentencing judge’s comment, it would not in any event be erroneous. The act of discharging a firearm directly at another person must be an act which carries a grave risk of death, even where there is no actual injury, and certainly regardless of the degree of injury inflicted or the availability of appropriate medical treatment. It is the act of aiming a loaded gun at another person, and firing the weapon at the person’s body which carries the risk, without more.
	
	
	In Colomer v R [2014] NSWCCA 51 at [38] – [40], it was held that there was a grave risk of death in the act of pointing a firearm at another person when the gun was “cocked”, with a bullet in the chamber, even where the firearm was not actually discharged.
	
	
	The applicant fired a high calibre pistol directly at the victim at relatively close range. Having hit his target, the applicant discharged a second shot directly into the body of his victim. On that evidence alone, the sentencing judge was entitled to conclude that there was a grave risk of death and, had she done so, there would have been no error.
	
	
	This ground is misconceived and I would not grant leave to argue it.
	


Ground 2: Her Honour erred in finding that the offence committed contrary to s 33 Crimes Act 1900 was aggravated by the fact that the offence was committed without regard for public safety


	
	Ground 2 involves a similar assertion about a comment made by the sentencing judge during the course of assessing the objective gravity of the offence. The applicant contends that, although she did not say so, the sentencing judge must have made a finding that a particular statutory feature of aggravation had been established on the evidence. The relevant provision is s 21A(2)(i) of the Act. This complaint relies upon a similar misreading of the process in which her Honour was engaged.
	
	
	The applicant asserts error by reference to the following two paragraphs from the sentence judgment:
	


“The offender went to [AB]’s porch and it was there he discharged the firearm. That is not to say, however, there was not therefore any risk to anybody else…[AB]’s wife came to the door when she heard the shots and there were other residents who were roused by the commotion. The offender fled with his weapon to the waiting car.

Whilst not exhibiting a high level of terror, risk or injury as in Razzak, it must be acknowledged that carrying a loaded gun in a suburban street brings with it an unacceptable level of risk to the residents of such street.”


	
	Making the same assertion as was made relevant to ground 1, the accused submits that:
	


“It is submitted that the discussion of “risk” to the victim’s wife and the residents must be a reference to the aggravating factor set out in s 21A(2)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, namely, that “the offence was committed without regard for public safety.”


	
	It is contended that, in making the observations she did, the sentencing judge was in fact making a finding that the offence was committed without regard to public safety, in circumstances where the evidence did not permit such a finding to be made.
	
	
	I am unable to draw the same conclusion that her Honour's comments ""must"" be a conclusion pursuant to s 21A(2)(i) of the Act, that the applicant's crime was an offence committed without regard for public safety.
	
	
	Context is again of relevance. The sentencing judge's remarks were made in the context of her assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. In that context, her Honour had regard to the location at which the offence occurred, and its potential dangerousness. There should be nothing troubling about a conclusion that discharging a firearm twice in the immediate vicinity of a residential building in which three people other than the intended victim were present, and at no great distance from a public street in a residential area, was an act that paid no regard to the safety of any person who might have been in the vicinity.
	
	
	Cognisance of those relevant factual features is to be distinguished from a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that a particular statutory feature referred to in s 21A(2) of the Act as a feature aggravating the commission of a crime has been established. The two should not be conflated in the absence of any more specific finding by the sentencing judge than is present in her Honour’s remarks.
	
	
	The applicant is seeking to read into the impugned passage something which is simply not there.
	
	
	Even had her Honour intended by her remarks in this regard, to make a finding that the particular feature of statutory aggravation had been made out, I would not regard her as thereby falling into error.
	
	
	The applicant submits that, in that the offence was committed within the curtilage of a private residence (something specifically noted by the sentencing judge at ROS 8), at a late hour of the evening, the evidence did not support a conclusion that the offence was committed without regard for public safety.
	
	
	The applicant relies upon R v Tuala [2015] NSWCCA 8 at [85] in support of his contention. There, Simpson J (as she then was), considered the application of s 21A(2)(i) of the Act to the offence then under consideration by this Court. With the agreement of Ward JA and me, her Honour noted:
	


“The shooting offences were committed in a public place, in the vicinity of a TAFE college, in daylight. I would therefore accept that they were indeed committed without regard for public safety. The question that arises in respect of the Crown’s proposition (vii) is not whether the offences were aggravated by that circumstance, but whether Robison DCJ failed to take it into account.”


	
	I do not take her Honour’s comments in this paragraph of Tuala as intended to lay down a rigid rule that only an offence committed in a public place in daylight hours will be one which may be taken to have been committed without regard for public safety. Those were relevant features in that particular matter, but each case must turn on its own facts.
	
	
	It could not be said, for example, that a shooting that occurred in the garden of a private residence at midnight could not be one committed without regard for public safety, if there was a well-attended party being held at that location at the time, with many people milling about in the vicinity of the shooting. Whether the commission of a particular offence demonstrates a disregard for public safety will depend upon the particular circumstances.
	
	
	Here, the applicant was carrying a loaded firearm in a public street and on private property in a residential area. There were persons other than AB in the area, notably his wife and children. The applicant’s conduct was, in those circumstances, clearly without regard for the safety of other persons who might have been in the vicinity, and whose safety was jeopardised by the applicant’s conduct.
	
	
	No arguable error has been established and I would not grant leave to advance this proposed ground.
	


Ground 3: In determining the objective seriousness of the offence committed contrary to s 7(1) Firearms Act 1996 her Honour erred in taking into account the applicant’s involvement in the OMCG


	
	The applicant’s complaint in support of this ground is that the sentencing judge erroneously concluded that the purpose of the possession of the firearm by the applicant was to advance the cause of the gang with which he was associated by resort to a firearm. The applicant contends that such is the only possible meaning of the following comment from the sentence judgment, at ROS 20 - 21:
	


“The learned Crown Prosecutor submitted, and I accept, that it is relevant to take into account the offender’s involvement at that time in the [OMCG]. The offender has demonstrated in his preceding activities, that is, the offence of cause grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, his willingness to progress the cause of the [OMCG] by resort to a firearm. This is not to punish the offender for the criminal tendency or to punish him for some intended misuse. Rather, it is due recognition of the context in which the offence occurred.”


	
	Specifically disavowing the importance and meaning of the last two sentences of that passage, the applicant submits that, “notwithstanding her Honour’s comments”, the line of reasoning employed was such that the sentencing judge was doubly punishing the applicant for a tendency or perceived tendency to misuse a firearm.
	
	
	I am not as willing as the applicant is to simply disregard part of her Honour’s relevant comments when determining the significance of the impugned passage. In particular, the last two sentences must inform her Honour’s purpose and meaning in making the comments; it would be quite wrong to simply ignore them because, presumably, they undermine the applicant’s argument.
	
	
	The sentencing judge specifically noted that she had regard to the applicant’s willingness to act in a way supportive of the activities of an OMCG, and to do so by utilising a firearm, as “due recognition of the context in which the offence occurred”. That was, in my opinion, an entirely proper way to approach the matter.
	
	
	The context of the applicant’s possession of a loaded and unsecured firearm was a relevant consideration that informed the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The offence did not fall to be assessed in a factual vacuum, as the applicant submitted, divorced from all else that had gone before. It was appropriately considered and assessed in the overall context in which it was committed, that being the applicant’s membership of, and participation in a criminal gang, and his possession and use of firearms as a means to advance the perceived interests of that gang.
	
	
	I would regard it as erroneous had the sentencing judge approached the matter as the applicant submitted was appropriate, by limiting the relevant factual background to the discovery of the firearm wrapped in fabric under a seat in the applicant’s car (AWS [15]).
	
	
	Her Honour properly considered the offence in its broader context. There is no error in that approach.
	
	
	I would not grant leave to argue this ground.
	


Ground 4: Her Honour erred in finding that the offences were aggravated by the fact that the applicant had previously been convicted of serious, personal violence offences


	
	As with grounds 1, 2, and 3, the applicant has extracted a discrete portion of the sentencing judge’s remarks, sought to sever it from the context in which it was made, and relied upon a sentence divorced from the whole to argue that her Honour “obviously” had in mind (AWS [17]) a feature of statutory aggravation (s 21A(2)(d) of the Act), wrongly applied.
	
	
	The remarks relied upon are as follows,
	


“As already mentioned, the offender was the subject to each of these bonds at the time of the commission of the four offences that bring him before the Court. This is a matter of aggravation. It might be noted that the offences of affray (s. 93C Crimes Act) and intimidate police officer while in execution of officer’s duty, although no actual bodily harm is occasioned to the officer (s 60(1) Crimes Act) are defined as “serious personal violence offences” even though they were subject to a two year jurisdictional limit in the Local Court.”


	
	The critical portion of the paragraph is the first two sentences, in which the sentencing judge referred to the breach of three good behaviour bonds by the applicant as a matter of aggravation. The applicant concedes that there can be no error in those sentences, but goes on to assert that the balance of the paragraph is “obviously” a reference to s 21A(2)(d) of the CSP Act, and it should thereby be inferred that the sentencing judge gave undue weight to the applicant’s prior criminal history.
	
	
	Section 21A(2)(d) provides for the following aggravating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence:
	


“The offender has a record of previous convictions (particularly if the offender is being sentenced for a serious personal violence offence and has a record of previous convictions for serious personal violence offences).”


	
	The facts of the applicant’s earlier crimes of violence were tendered to the sentencing court without objection. What those facts reveal are the commission by the applicant of crimes which, for offences of their nature, were very violent or threatened considerable violence. Having been placed on three separate good behaviour bonds for those offences, the applicant breached the conditional liberty afforded him in the most serious of ways, by committing four very grave offences, one of them an offence involving a very high level of violence, with the remainder being serious firearms offences.
	
	
	It was open to the sentencing judge in those circumstances to give very considerable weight to the applicant’s history of offending conduct, and his subsequent disregard for the orders of the courts which directed him to be of good behaviour.
	
	
	Acknowledging that the applicant’s breach of conditional liberty was an aggravating feature to which her Honour was entitled to have regard, the applicant nevertheless complains that the sentencing judge was in error in referring to his previous convictions as offences of serious personal violence, and must by that reference have been drawing a conclusion adverse to the applicant of the presence of the aggravating feature listed by s 21A(2)(d).
	
	
	This contention is again made in circumstances where the sentencing judge made no reference to s 21A(2)(d), and was considering the applicant’s criminal history in a context different to that which would attach to a discussion of the presence of features of statutory aggravation.
	
	
	Whilst a “personal violence offence” has a particular statutory meaning pursuant to s 4(a) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 that does not encompass those offences of which the applicant had been previously convicted, the phrase also has an ordinary meaning and usage which predates the statutory scheme. There is for example, an entire chapter (chapter 50) in the Sentencing Bench Book (Judicial Commission of New South Wales) that deals with personal violence offences. That chapter includes offences contrary to s 60 of the Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	Although her Honour’s exact meaning is unclear to me, what is clear is that the impugned sentence was something of an aside (“it might be noted that”), and was not a reference to a finding that a statutory feature of aggravation had been made out. The sentencing judge was doing no more than observing that the applicant’s criminal history was for serious offences of personal violence, an observation that was correct.
	
	
	I see no error, and certainly no error that has wrongly aggravated the penalty imposed upon the applicant.
	
	
	I would not grant leave to raise this ground.
	


Ground 5: The sentence imposed upon the applicant in respect of the offence contrary to s 33 Crimes Act 1900 was manifestly excessive


	
	The applicant contends that, having regard to the discount of 50% the notional “starting point” for the sentence was manifestly excessive, and thus the sentence imposed must also be manifestly excessive.
	
	
	In support of his complaint of manifest excess, the applicant provided the Court with sentencing statistics published by the Judicial Commission relevant to offences contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900. In reliance upon those statistics, the applicant submitted that the “starting point” of the sentence imposed by her Honour was “very much at the top end of sentences imposed” (AWS [22]).
	
	
	Such an argument says nothing about whether a particular sentence might be regarded as manifestly excessive (or manifestly inadequate). It is an argument which has been frequently rejected by this Court, and yet it continues to be advanced. In Ma and Pham v R [2007] NSWCCA 240, Hulme J, with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Hoeben J (as their Honours then, respectively, were) said, at [91],
	


“Subliminal in the reference to the statistics and the observation that the sentences here fall into the highest end of the range is the proposition that that is indicative of error. The proposition must be rejected. As this Court has said on many occasions, the range extends to the maximum penalty set by Parliament and it is against that that an offender's conduct must primarily be judged. Certainly, the statistics may at times inspire further reflection on the sentence in a particular case and perhaps give some limited guidance but, of themselves, they do not demonstrate error. Particularly is this so because, within each category, they provide no details of the cases reflected in them.”


	
	See also a similar comment from Hulme J in Hampton v R [2010] NSWCCA 278; (2010) 208 A Crim R 478, at [55] – [56].
	
	
	The extent of the range with respect to the applicant’s crime is a sentence of imprisonment for 25 years. The other statutory guidepost was the standard non-parole period (“SNPP”) of 7 years specified against this offence, although it was of lesser significance in the context of this case than was the maximum penalty, as was discussed in R v Mitchell & Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296; (2007) 177 A Crim R 94, at [37],
	


“Where a particular case falls well above the mid-range of offending, the standard non-parole period will have less significance as a guidepost and more attention should be directed to the maximum penalty in determining the appropriate sentence. This must be so otherwise an offence falling within the worst category of case, and so notionally attracting the maximum penalty, would be drawn away from that point by the standard non-parole period and a court could never impose the maximum penalty. This does not mean that the standard non-parole period loses all relevance and it may still have work to do as a guide to determining the non-parole period. So, for example, with an offence of objective seriousness well above mid-range it may be unlikely that, even after a discount for the plea of guilty, or a consideration of the subjective circumstances of the offender or a finding of special circumstances the result would be a non-parole of, or below, the standard non-parole period prescribed.”


	
	Her Honour’s assessment of the particular offence, within the range of such matters, was that it fell towards the higher end of that spectrum. For my part, I see no error in her Honour’s conclusion in that regard.
	
	
	This was an extremely grave offence. The applicant went, disguised and armed with a loaded, unregistered firearm to a residential home in which a family with young children lived, that home being located in a residential street where doubtless other families lived. The applicant had planned to commit the crime which followed. Two shots were fired directly into the body of the victim, with the second shot discharged after the victim had already fallen injured to the verandah. The crime was committed in furtherance of the objectives of a criminal gang. The injuries occasioned to the victim were serious. It is only the fact that the injuries were not as serious as some encompassed by the phrase grievous bodily harm, that prevented this matter from falling within the worst category for such a crime. There were wider consequences, including the disquiet and fear that such a crime, committed in a suburban street, would inevitably engender in the local community.
	
	
	Particularly bearing in mind the legislative guideposts relevant to an offence contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900, and noting the very grave nature of this offence, I am not persuaded that there is any error in the sentence imposed.
	
	
	Leave to argue this ground should be refused.
	


Ground 6: The overall sentence was manifestly excessive


	
	The final ground of appeal sought to be advanced by the applicant is that the overall sentence is manifestly excessive. The total effective sentence was a non-parole period of 7 years and 9 months imprisonment, with an additional term of 4 years and 3 months. The overall head sentence was one of 12 years imprisonment.
	
	
	Her Honour was obliged to sentence the applicant for four very serious crimes, each of which had been committed in the context, and against the background, of the applicant’s participation in a criminal gang, whilst subject to conditional liberty. Each of the four offences was objectively grave. Each was one which required, in particular, principles of general deterrence to be given prominence.
	
	
	Others must be deterred from committing offences of serious violence utilising a firearm, and especially when such crimes occur within the course of gang activity. Equally, firearms offences are an increasing threat to the community, and the possession and sale of such weapons fuels the commission of crimes involving guns. General deterrence is of great importance in deterring such crime.
	
	
	It was necessary for the sentencing court to impose a sentence which met the objectives set out in s 3A of the CSP Act, and complied with all relevant principles of sentencing. In her detailed and careful judgment, her Honour set out all relevant features of the matter, and noted applicable law and principle. She did not allow extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect her decision, or fail to consider some material matter, or mistake the facts: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at [504]-[505].
	
	
	The party advancing a claim of manifest excess, or manifest inadequacy, must establish that the sentence was unreasonable or unfair: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [325]. That burden is to be discharged in an environment where there is no “correct” sentence.
	
	
	As was noted in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [27]:
	


“Express legislative provisions apart, neither principle, nor any of the grounds of appellate review, dictates the particular path that a sentencer, passing sentence in a case where the penalty is not fixed by statute, must follow in reasoning to the conclusion that the sentence to be imposed should be fixed as it is. The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached. As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies.”


	
	These words are not to be regarded as hollow rhetoric to be piously intoned and then carefully ignored. First instance judges are to be allowed the flexibility the High Court referred to in Markarian because it is the sentencing judge who has had the best and most complete opportunity to consider the evidence (in this case encompassing evidence given at trial by witnesses including the applicant), to apply the relevant principles to the evidence, and to arrive at a sentence which is intuitively reached, and which is based in part on the experience of the court.
	
	
	An approach of isolating individual sentences from the context of a lengthy sentence judgment, and then seeking to read into the extracted words a meaning which is not explicitly there, with the aim of discovering error is to be rejected. Nor is a sentence to be regarded as manifestly excessive or inadequate because this Court might have imposed a different sentence: Markarian at [26] – [28].
	
	
	Nothing in her Honour’s careful judgment bespeaks error requiring the intervention of this Court.
	
	
	The broad sentencing discretion that reposes in the sentencing court did not miscarry. The individual and the overall sentences imposed were well within the proper exercise of that discretion. Indeed, only the assistance given by the applicant to the authorities could justify the leniency implicit in the sentences imposed.
	
	
	Leave to appeal should be refused.
	


Proposed Orders


	
	I propose that leave to appeal is refused.
	
	
	R S HULME AJ: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Wilson J. I agree with her Honour that the appeal should fail.
	


Ground 1


	
	While I am not prepared to conclude that every use of a gun involves a grave risk of death to a victim, the injuries suffered by the victim in this case – injuries extending significantly beyond the thighs apparently aimed at – demonstrate firstly that the weapon was not fired with such care and precision as to avoid that risk and secondly, in fact, there was a grave risk of death – a consequence only avoided by the medical treatment which the victim in fact received.
	
	
	I reach this conclusion without deciding whether or not the sentencing judge was intending to reflect the terms of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  Certainly there are in her Honour’s series of references to “planned and organised criminal activity”, that the offender “used a weapon”, that its use “involved a high degree of violence”, and was “within the curtilage of [the victim’s] home, “and involved a grave risk of death” echoes of s 21A. Her Honour’s reference to risk to the victim’s wife and “unacceptable level of risk to the residents of” the street also suggests her Honour had in mind the provisions of s 21A (2)(i) “the offence was committed without regard for public safety”. However even without the terms of s 21A these matters would be relevant and, given the other conclusions at which I have arrived, I do not find it necessary to decide whether her Honour was directing attention specifically to the dictates of the section.
	
	
	Ground 1 fails.
	


Ground 2


	
	In support of this ground, reliance was placed on remarks of her Honour:
	


“The offender went to [the victim’s] porch and it was there he discharged the firearm. That is not to say, however, there was not therefore any risk to any one else… [The victim’s] wife came to the door when she heard the shots and there were other residents who were roused by the commotion. The offender fled with his weapon to the waiting car.

Whilst not exhibiting a high level of terror, risk or injury as in “Razzak”, it must be acknowledged that carrying a loaded gun in a suburban street brings with it an unacceptable level of risk to the residents of such street.”


	
	Given the deliberateness of the actions of the Applicant in, as the Facts on Sentence recount, walking within sight of the victim to the top of the stairs leading to the porch and, as may be inferred, deliberately choosing the victim’s thighs as the place to shoot, I doubt whether there was more than slight risk to anyone other than the victim.
	
	
	Providing things went according to plan, there was minimal risk to persons other than the victim. However, things do not always go according to plan. From time to time persons do react and interfere with the actions of persons armed with weapons. Offenders generally seek to avoid being caught and in the commonly emotion charged atmosphere of serious offending and escape, damaging events do happen.
	
	
	While as I have said I would not regard any risk to persons other than the victim as more than slight, I do not regard her Honour as wrong when she concluded that there was a risk to the victim’s wife. However, neither that finding nor that of an “unacceptable level of risk to the residents” amounts to a finding that, in terms of the ground, the offence was “committed without regard to public safety.”
	
	
	Ground 2 also fails.
	


Grounds 3, 4, 5 and 6


	
	I agree with the reasons of Wilson J.
	


Generally


	
	I would add the following.
	
	
	The discount allowed to the Applicant for the grievous bodily harm offence was unduly generous. In addition, there was a significant degree of concurrency in the sentences imposed.
	
	
	There has been no Crown appeal against any of the sentences but even were I inclined to uphold one of the grounds of appeal, I would have been disposed to deprive the Applicant of the benefits referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph by way of offsetting any benefit from such upholding. Actions such as those the subject of the charges against the Applicant are far too frequent in the community and the courts need to impose penalties which in fact operate as a real deterrent.

Introduction


	
	The applicant, Akl Hawchar, applied for an authority to drive a taxi-cab on 16 December 2014. His application was refused.
	
	
	He sought an internal review of that decision. The internal review decision made on 31 March 2015 affirmed the decision to refuse to grant an authorisation to drive a public passenger vehicle under s 33B of the Passenger Transport Act 1990 (the Act). The applicant seeks the review of that decision.
	


The issues in the case


	
	The issues in this case were whether the applicant is considered to be of good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person to be the driver of a taxi-cab. For the reasons that follow, I affirm the decision under review.
	


The law


	
	Section 33(1) of the Act confers power on the respondent to “authorise persons to drive taxi-cabs subject to and in accordance with this Division”
	
	
	Section 33(3) of the Act provides:
	


“The purpose of an authority under this Division is to attest:


	
	that the authorised person is considered to be of good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person to be the driver of a taxi-cab, and
	
	
	that the authorised person is considered to have sufficient responsibility and aptitude to drive a taxi-cab:
	



	
	in accordance with the conditions under which the taxi-cab service concerned is operated, and
	
	
	in accordance with law and custom.”
	


The evidence


	
	The applicant provided a two-and-a-half page statement and various supporting documents (Exhibit A1). He provided eight references in similar terms from various people (Exhibit A2). Each was addressed “To whom it may concern”, stated how long the referee had known the applicant, that he was a trustworthy friend and had been found at all times to be an honest peace-loving, courteous, dependable and caring person. Each referee said that he would be happy to provide further information if required and provided a telephone contact.
	
	
	The respondent relied on 507 pages of material it had filed in the Tribunal, two bundles of documents produced under summons by Parramatta Local Court (Exhibits R1 and R2) and NSW Police Force Court History Convictions for the applicant (Exhibit R3).
	
	
	In his application to drive a taxi-cab the applicant signed and declared that he had read and understood all the questions and that his answers were true, correct and accurate in every detail.
	
	
	In response to question 16(h) on the Medical Assessment Form Public Passenger Vehicle Driver dated 15 October 2014, if he had ever had or been told by a doctor that he had “psychiatric, psychological, nervous disorder or depression” the applicant placed a cross in both boxes “yes” and “no”, put a tick next to the “yes” box and wrote next to the boxes: “False statement by Police want my license back and my plate back and all my losses since my license was cancelled”.
	
	
	In answer to question 24, the applicant said that he had not, in the last ten years, ever been before a court in NSW or elsewhere for any reason where he had been found guilty or convicted for an offence.
	
	
	In his internal review application, the applicant stated:
	


“The charges I’ve received shouldn’t of been charged to my name because I was helping the police with information about the firearms on the property. Police put in false claims in the statements, they misunderstood me, the firearm was not on me, or in car, or on my property, all claims were falsified. When explaining to the police about the situation, police claimed that they would put exactly what was said, but put different information which I never provided. The charges that have been included in this decision are dismissed without me paying any fines or any conviction.”

Consideration and findings


	
	In his statement, the applicant claimed that he needed legal aid to support his case and a Lebanese Arabic interpreter. Near the beginning of the hearing, I asked the applicant if he wanted an interpreter. He said that he had been in Australia for 38 years. As long as I explained things, he would not need an interpreter. The hearing proceeded. I did not observe the applicant to have any difficulty understanding or answering questions in English. He did not claim that he could not understand what he was being asked. He answered in English.
	
	
	Following is a summary of the applicant’s criminal history which is based on the evidence before the Tribunal and which it accepts. The offences are set out chronologically beginning with the most recent. The offences were discussed during the hearing. A summary of the applicant’s evidence is set out after each offence.
	
	
	On 15 October 2010, the applicant was convicted of the offence of ‘Possess firearm under prohibited order – not prohibited firearm/pistol –T2’ at Parramatta Local Court and placed on a s. 9 bond, that is a bond pursuant to s. 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, for two years. His signature appears on the “Bond to comply with conditions” under the wording “I accept the bond”. That offence was committed on 23 May 2009 in Granville. The applicant claimed that that charge was dismissed.
	
	
	It is relevant to this case that the applicant’s shooter’s licence had been revoked in 1997. The revocation order was included in Exhibit R2. It is one of the matters about which the applicant continues to feel aggrieved.
	
	
	On 12 May 2010 the applicant was convicted of the following offences at Parramatta Local Court and placed on a s. 9 bond for two years for each conviction:
	



	
	Possess unregistered firearm-prohibited firearm -- T2;
	
	
	Possess ammunition without holding licence/permit/authority;
	
	
	Not keep firearm safely – prohibited firearm;
	
	
	Use unauthorised prohibited firearm –T2.
	



	
	Those offences were committed on a property in the Mudgee area on 8 November 2009. The applicant claimed that those charges were dismissed.
	
	
	The applicant’s signature again appears on the “Bond to comply with conditions” document under the words “I accept the bond”.
	
	
	On 26 May 2004 the applicant was convicted of the offence of ‘Stalk/Intimidate with intent to cause fear physical/mental harm – T2’, placed on a s 9 bond for two years and fined $300. He said that the charges had been dismissed. He did not hurt anyone.
	
	
	On 8 June 2001 the applicant was convicted of two offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm –T2, placed on a s9 bond for three years and fined $150.
	
	
	In 1997, the applicant was charged with assault and four charges of offensive language in relation to officers of the NRMA and the police. The transcript of proceedings on 14 March 1997 shows that the Magistrate dismissed the charges and discharged the applicant into the care of his wife, pursuant to s 32(3)(a) of the Mental Health Criminal Procedure Act having heard evidence from the applicant’s wife that she would ensure he attended medical appointments and take his medication.  At the end of the hearing, the Magistrate explained that the applicant was being discharged into the care of his wife: “to see that you continue with this medical treatment and that you continue to take your medication, do you understand?” The applicant replied “Yes sir”.
	
	
	The Magistrate made those orders based on the report of a treating psychiatrist dated 13 March 1997 which stated that the applicant was diagnosed as paranoid and that “it is anticipated that this patient will do well if he continues to” abstain from heavy alcohol drinking, continues to attend a psychiatrist once a month initially and later once every two or three months and continues his compliance with his medications, “including the anti-psychotics”. The history recorded that “he had delusions and hallucinations … He believed that the NRMA officers were following him around and reported to this practice that an NRMA vehicle parked in from of him…..he indicated that the NRMA officers are trying to send him crazy due to ‘jealously’”. The doctor referred to the court case, “the jist (sic) of which is that he has been paranoid and threatening to officers of the NRMA and police”.
	
	
	When the applicant was referred to 25 NRMA drivers claiming he had harassed them, he claimed that they had harassed him because he made claims against his policy.
	
	
	When the applicant was referred to information about transport officers claiming he had harassed them, the applicant said that he never harassed anyone. He had a loud voice. He just wanted his taxi authority back.
	
	
	He denied abusing police. When referred to page 178 of the respondent’s documents, he said that he had never said that he did not swear.
	
	
	In the course of his evidence, the applicant said that if you have a computer and paper you can write anything against him. You need more proof than that to say he is violent. In summary, he claimed that the police report in 1996 started everything that happened against him. He had paid $55,000 to extend the hours he could operate his vehicle. He has not been able to earn any money since he lost his authority to drive a taxi-cab. He rang the Department of Transport. He is going to sue them for 15 years of lost income. He believes he could have had three houses and three taxi plates like a friend of his who died. He also lost his shooter’s licence. I find that those grievances continue to dominate his thinking.
	
	
	When asked at the hearing if he had ever been told that he had a mental illness, the applicant said no. When asked if he remembered being charged with assaulting NRMA officers, the applicant said that they were false statements.
	
	
	When reminded that the 1997 charges were dismissed because he had been diagnosed with a mental illness and he was discharged into the care of his wife who had given evidence that she would make him take his medications, the applicant said that was all wrong and he did not take medication. (See pages 237 to 243 of the respondent’s documents.)
	
	
	When the applicant was referred to a report from a general practitioner dated 18 April 1997 which stated that in his opinion, the applicant can work as a taxi driver during the day “if he takes his antipsychotic drug Stelazine 5 mg at night time”, the applicant said he “never took it” (page 250 of the respondent’s documents).
	
	
	When referred to a psychiatrist’s report dated 20 April 2010 provided in relation to the applicant’s defence of the 8 November 2009 offences, the applicant said that he took it but never read it. The solicitor said to go to the doctor so he did not go to gaol. The doctor wrote that the applicant was reluctant to discuss his psychiatric history or that he had ever been told that he was paranoid but did say he had seen at least two psychiatrists. The applicant agreed that one had suggested he take medication “for worry” but he refused to take them. The doctor’s diagnosis was chronic paranoid schizophrenia.
	
	
	Mr Wozniak referred to paragraphs 9 and 10 of the 27 April 2000 decision of the Administrative Decision Appeals Tribunal of New South Wales, Hawchar v Director-General, Department of Transport [2000] NSWADT 50 which recorded the applicant’s answers to the same questions. The applicant elaborated upon his criticism of one doctor he accused of being a sick man at that time. The applicant made a serious allegation about how that doctor treated female patients.
	
	
	The applicant referred to the assessment completed by a doctor on 17 October 2014 which he submitted with his application. He said that he had been seeing the doctor for the last three years. The doctor assessed the applicant as meeting the relevant criteria for an unconditional authority. The doctor ticked the box “No” in response to question 35 “Is Neuropsychological Assessment required (e.g. in a case of head injury)?” This doctor was also the author of the 18 April 1997 report referred to above.
	
	
	Given the applicant’s mental health history including the 2010 psychiatric report, and his denial of that history and his criminal history, I give no weight to that medical report.
	
	
	I accept that the applicant genuinely believes what he said at the hearing. However, his evidence is not consistent with the reality of his mental health or criminal histories.
	
	
	I have taken into account the references the applicant provided. However, I give them little weight. None of the references reflects that the referee knows the purpose for which the reference would be used, or knows of the applicant’s criminal history, referred to above.
	
	
	The Appeal Panel of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal said in Director General, Transport NSW v AIC (GD) [2011] NSWADTAP 65 (23 December 2011), the concepts of “good repute” and “fit and proper person” involve different considerations. “The former concept goes to the way in which a person is regarded by others in the community … while the latter concept goes to an individual’s intrinsic characteristics, whether they are known to others or not”.
	
	
	I accept Mr Wozniak’s submission that in this case, the applicant’s criminal history is cogent evidence of bad repute. The applicant does not accept that he has committed the offences. He is therefore incapable of rehabilitation by accepting what he has done and changing to show that he is now of good repute. In making those findings, I have given most weight to the recent 2009 offences. However, the length of his criminal history, the number of offences, and seriousness of his offences are also relevant to the finding that I have made.
	
	
	It follows from my finding that the applicant genuinely believes what he said at the hearing, that I do not accept that this is a case where an applicant has intentionally given incorrect answers to the questions on the application form such that the answers demonstrate bad repute.
	
	
	The decision-maker relies on the applicant giving correct answers to the questions asked in the application form. The applicant did give incorrect answers to the two questions. I find that his inability to correctly answer the questions is an intrinsic characteristic that means that he is not a fit and proper person to be a driver of a taxi-cab.
	
	
	For the above reasons, I affirm the decision under review.

Introduction


	
	On 16 April 2014 Mr Rodney Willis, aged 76, was murdered by the husband of the offender who hit his head with shocking force, using first a tyre lever and, when that did not inflict sufficient injury, with a heavy pipe shortly after. The post mortem examination revealed skull fractures in the right parietal, left temporal and base of Mr Willis’ skull together with very significant brain damage and associated lacerations. He was in his own home and taken unawares by the attack. He plainly suffered extreme pain before unconsciousness supervened, probably at an early point. This calculated, cruel murder was committed in an attempt to delay the detection by Mr Willis of a theft by his killer and his wife, the present offender, of almost all the money in his bank account. The judge who sentenced her husband accepted that the initial attack was undertaken with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm but the second attack was intended to kill. On 5 December 2014 the co-offender pleaded guilty to the offence of murder. The starting point for his sentence (reduced for reasons which are presently irrelevant) was 38 years imprisonment.
	
	
	When first arraigned upon an indictment charging her with Mr Willis’ murder on 3 July 2015, the offender pleaded not guilty and a trial date of 26 October 2015 was fixed. On 3 September 2015 she was rearraigned and then entered a plea of guilty. The essential basis of this plea is that the offender had agreed with the co-offender that he was to inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr Willis but had neither contemplated his death nor agreed to it.
	


Facts


	
	Tendered on the sentence proceedings was a statement of agreed facts from which the following narrative is largely taken. As at the date of his death Mr Willis, as I have mentioned, was 76 years of age residing in The Rock (a small town about 30km south west of Wagga Wagga) in a granny flat at the rear of a house occupied by his maternal nephew, Mr Owen, and the offender, the co-offender and their two young daughters. The offenders discovered that Mr Willis had something over $30,000 in his bank account and agreed to steal $30,000 from him by the co-offender writing out a cheque for that sum payable to himself, of course unbeknownst to Mr Willis. On 15 April 2014 the co-offender deposited the cheque into his bank account. On the morning of the next day, Mr Willis discovered that the money was missing when he withdrew a small amount from an ATM. He spoke to a number of people in town about the missing money and went home at around 10am to contact his bank. (Following his death paperwork relating to the missing funds was found on Mr Willis’ dining table and it is apparent that he intended to telephone his bank about the issue.) Although it is not clear how, the offender discovered shortly after 10am that Mr Willis had found out about the missing money and she told the co-offender. As the agreed facts state –
	


“The offender and co-offender discussed the situation and they jointly decided to delay and/or prevent Mr Willis alerting the authorities by inflicting upon him at least really serious bodily harm. It was contemplated by the offender that the co-offender would use a weapon.”


	
	The co-offender then went to the main door of the granny flat, which was open. Mr Willis was just inside. The co-offender, who had taken a tyre iron with him, hit Mr Willis several times on the head but, thinking that this did not sufficiently disable him, returned to the house, turned up the sound on the television, took a heavy pipe from the yard, returned to the flat and renewed his attack. In his apparently candid account to police about what had happened (except that it omitted all mention of the offender), he said that Mr Willis was still alive after he used the pipe, so he thought about getting “something bigger … [which] might like do it quicker but I couldn’t … do it, I couldn’t do it”. He returned to the house and left him to die.
	
	
	Mr Owen had gone out earlier and returned at approximately 11am. He and the two offenders smoked cannabis together for about 20 minutes. Sometime before 11.30am Mr Owen went to the granny flat and, hearing Mr Willis whimpering through the bedroom window, looked inside and saw his uncle lying on the floor with blood on his head. He thought he had fallen over and went inside. Mr Willis was lying on his back on the bedroom floor gasping for breath. Mr Owen returned to the house and told the offender what he had seen. They then told the co-offender, who was in the shower at the time. Mr Owen then contacted “000” on his way back to the flat. Though he attempted to assist his uncle, he was unable to follow the directions of the “000” operator. He found a neighbour who applied CPR until an ambulance and police arrived at about 11.50am. However, Mr Willis did not respond and CPR ceased, death being pronounced at 12.17pm. I should say, in fairness, that it is certain that there was nothing either Mr Owen or the neighbour could have done to save Mr Willis’ life. Neither the offender nor the co-offender attempted to assist Mr Willis.
	
	
	Sometime before police arrived, the co-offender made arrangements with his sister to travel to Melbourne by train, which they caught at 2.15pm. Whilst in Melbourne, he admitted to friends that he had committed the murder and one of them contacted the authorities to tell them of these admissions. In the meantime, at about 3.17pm, the offender told police that the co-offender had not been in the premises and stated that she did not know how to contact him, also stating that she had no idea what had happened to Mr Willis. On 18 April 2014 the offender travelled with friends to Melbourne to collect the co-offender, en route making admissions as to what she knew about what had happened to Mr Willis. The offenders then left Melbourne and returned to The Rock, where they both made further admissions to friends about their involvement in the crime, including the offender admitting that she had washed the bloodstained clothes that the co-offender had been wearing at the time of the attack.
	
	
	Both offenders were arrested on 20 April 2014 but declined to answer any questions. However, on 30 April 2014 the co-offender, then in custody, was interviewed as a volunteer, and made the admissions about killing Mr Willis to which I have already referred.
	
	
	It is clear that Mr Willis was assaulted to prevent him from stopping payment on the forged cheque and exposing the offenders' theft. It is admitted by the offender, in effect, that this would be achieved by attacking him and inflicting grievous bodily injury. Mr Young SC, counsel for the offender, contended that the offender intended no more than that Mr Willis was to be rendered unconscious. I do not accept this submission. Firstly, there is no evidence that supports it. Secondly, it is inconsistent with the plea. It is obvious that unconsciousness may be brought about in a number of ways and by force of varying degrees. The mere causing of unconsciousness by the use of force would not, or may not, amount to the infliction of grievous bodily harm and an intention merely to cause unconsciousness would be insufficient to establish the intentional element of the crime of murder which requires an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. There is nothing in the agreed statement of facts that discloses the degree of injury the offender thought might result from the intended attack, let alone that suggests that she discussed the issue with her co-offender. In the end, Mr Young in effect submitted that I should act on the basis that the mode of causing unconsciousness was understood by the offender as involving the infliction of grievous bodily harm. In light of the admissions implicit in her plea and this explicit concession, I was prepared to allow the plea to stand. In the result, there is no further material on the offender’s intention except that she agreed the co-offender was to use a weapon to inflict very serious injury that would delay or prevent Mr Willis from contacting “the authorities”, which must mean the bank or the police. If this were to be effected, considerable injury must have been contemplated: momentary disablement would not have sufficed. This is to give the offender the benefit of the doubt that prevention, as distinct from delay, was not in mind, since this would have implied a fatal attack. Given the basis of the plea, as accepted by the Crown, such a conclusion is not open. I should mention also that the evidence does not permit the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was aware that the co-offender attacked Mr Willis a second time.
	
	
	There are cases in which grievous bodily harm might well be inflicted without a significant risk of fatal consequences and such cases will usually be less culpable than those where a fatal consequence is likely. In this case, there is no evidence of the offender's understanding as to the extent of force to be used except that it would be grievous bodily harm (caused by violent use of a weapon) sufficient to significantly delay any attempt by Mr Willis to frustrate the fraud and the offender must be sentenced on the basis that she did not contemplate the possibility that Mr Willis might be killed. It seems to me that, in fact, the offender was indifferent to the extent of injury to be inflicted, providing it served the purpose, a decision that she left to her co-offender. In the result, her moral culpability, though less than it would have been if it were possible to conclude that the offender had actually contemplated that her co-offender might inflict on Mr Willis the most serious injuries short of lethal, is very grave, especially having regard to the consequence that Mr Willis died as a result.
	
	
	It is generally, though not invariably, the case that the commission of murder when the intention is to inflict grievous bodily harm is significantly less culpable than where the intention is to kill. These matters are inherently incommensurable but I accept the submission of Mr Young SC, with which the Crown prosecutor agreed, that in this case the offender’s culpability is significantly less than it would have been had she contemplated the possibility that Mr Willis would be killed. Moreover, I should also sentence on the basis that her culpability is less than that of her co-offender because he inflicted the injuries on Mr Willis and she was not present at the time.
	


Subjective circumstances


	
	The offender has a minor and inconsequential criminal record.
	
	
	A report by Anna Robilliard, forensic psychologist, was tendered without objection. It contains an extensive account of the offender's background and psychological situation. Although it is true that the offender did not give evidence and, accordingly, did not verify the history contained in the report, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to act on the basis that she told Ms Robilliard the truth. This is especially so given that the Crown prosecutor did not submit otherwise.
	
	
	The offender, now just short of her 27th birthday, was adopted from an orphanage in Romania when aged something over two years by an Australian couple and has little knowledge of her biological parents. She was brought to Australia about a year later and lived with her adoptive parents at their home just outside metropolitan Sydney. Her relationship with her parents, especially her mother, was troubled and she was estranged from them from time to time. At the age of 17 she moved out of home following a contretemp with her mother and came and went on several occasions, last living with her parents in 2014. Although she attended school until year 10, she was overtly rebellious and frequently truanted. After school she worked at a supermarket on a checkout, staying over a year but then resigned, obtained work at a nursing home and undertook TAFE training, achieving Certificates III and IV as an Assistant in Nursing. She had a number of unsuccessful relationships. She last had paid employment at age 21 when she was a business manager for a company that sold vacuum cleaners. She said she worked hard and used amphetamines in order to work longer hours. (She continued to use drugs, including amphetamines, up to the date of her arrest.) It was at this time that she met her husband, the co-offender, and resigned when she was pregnant with their first child, although she returned and worked into the early months of her second pregnancy. The relationship with the co-offender was unstable from the outset and never improved although it did not involve physical abuse. They have two young children, now being cared for by her parents and brother. The offenders have now agreed to a divorce.
	
	
	It appears that the offender has been using drugs including “speed” and “ice” from about the age of 19. She reported to Ms Robilliard that, when the offence took place, she and the co-offender “were off our heads on ice”. She said that the offence “would never have happened if I was in my right mind”. By virtue of s 21A(5AA) of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) this cannot be taken into account as mitigation. Nevertheless, it might at least partially explain how she came to commit the offence. Whilst not mitigatory, I accept that the scheme, so far as both offenders were concerned, indicated a degree of impulsive irrationality to which their having been affected by drugs may well have contributed. This is relevant to prospects of rehabilitation and provides some support for the information, to which I briefly refer below, from her close relatives that the offence was out of character.
	
	
	Psychometric testing demonstrated that the offender was within the below average to average intelligence range with particular strength in the verbal domain. Her ability to care for herself and adequately maintain self-sufficiency in the community appeared to be appropriate and there was no indication of cognitive impairment or intellectual disability. However, testing showed marked dysfunctional personality disorders associated with instability and unpredictability of mood and behaviour with lack of foresight and a capacity for antisocial impulsive acting out. She also had symptoms of PTSD (from several traumatic incidents in her childhood), elevated anxiety and reactive depression. There was persuasive evidence of remorse. I do not regard the offender’s psychological condition as justifying significant mitigation, although it might explain to some degree the ill-judged impulsivity of the offence. It is not otherwise connected with its commission and Mr Young SC did not submit otherwise.
	
	
	As mentioned, tendered in the proceedings were letters from the offender’s close relatives: her father, cousin, aunt and another relative by marriage, all of whom of course have known her since childhood. They strongly feel, based on their knowledge and experience of her over the years, that her commission of this offence was completely at odds with the person they knew. At the same time, as Ms Robilliard’s report shows, the offender has some deep seated psychological problems of which her family appear to have been unaware but which, perhaps exacerbated by drug abuse, have had a significant and harmful effect on the woman they thought they knew.
	
	
	Although the psychological problems to which I have adverted suggest that the offender’s rehabilitation will not be easy, the offence took place in a particular context when she was in a relationship with a person from whom she is now separated and is unlikely to be renewed. I accept that she is genuinely contrite. She is still relatively young and the lengthy term of imprisonment, together with the rehabilitation programs which she will very likely undertake, hold out a very real prospect that, on her release, she will be able to avoid reoffending. Avoidance of drug use will be of considerable importance. The close and continuing support of her family will be an important factor in this respect.
	
	
	I accept that the offender loves her children, who are still very young, and that an additional heavy price she will pay for the commission of this offence, for which lengthy incarceration is inevitable, is that she will be unable to be a mother to them as they grow into young adults, with a consequential substantial risk that their relationship might be broken beyond repair. This is an additional hardship which results from her imprisonment and should be taken into account. (I note, however, that it is somewhat difficult to accept that she was able to provide appropriate care for her children whilst abusing drugs to the level which she disclosed to Ms Robilliard.)
	


Victim impact statements


	
	Victim impact statements have been received from Mrs Christine Willis, Mr Willis’ sister in law. Ms Holly Marsden and Ms Meaghan Owen, two of his nieces. The latter read her statement to the Court. These statements are moving testimony to the terrible grief and pain that members of Mr Willis’ family suffered as a result of his shocking death. He was clearly a gentle and decent man whose quiet contribution to the lives of his family and loved ones had a profound effect upon them, and the loss of which has given rise to great suffering.
	
	
	I note that the use and purpose of these statements is governed by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I have taken them into account in accordance with the principles repeatedly stated by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Of course, Mr Willis' death came at the cost not only of individuals whose lives he had touched but also the community of which he was a part.
	


Consideration


	
	The offender had agreed to the commission of a terrible crime, which would have been very grave, even if Mr Willis had not died as a result. Although she did not intend that he would be killed and did not contemplate this possibility, the law applies criminal culpability to this consequence. A life has been taken and the administration of criminal justice requires due acknowledgment of this in the measure of punishment.
	
	
	The maximum term of imprisonment for the crime of murder is life imprisonment, with an applicable standard non-parole period of 20 years. It is clear that this is not a case falling in the worst category of the crime and a sentence of life imprisonment is not appropriate. There was no intention to kill, nor did the offender commit the violence and, although she agreed to the infliction of grievous bodily harm, there is no evidence from which I could conclude that she instigated the offence. The offence was impulsive. Other matters of relevance to the assessment of objective seriousness are: Mr Willis was vulnerable by virtue of his age; the offence was committed in his home; it involved the use of weapons; the motive was greed and an attempt to escape justice; the degree of violence contemplated by the offender was very substantial and, although this is an inherent element of the offence, much more than minimally satisfied it.
	
	
	Whilst an assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is an necessary part of the sentencing process, the notion is essentially incommensurable, especially for an offence of one of such inherent seriousness as murder. I consider that the offence here is not to be regarded as falling into the more serious class. I think that the case falls just below the middle of the range. This, of course, yields no particular outcome either rationally or in point of principle, since the ultimate sentence must necessarily be an instinctive synthesis of all the relevant factors, objective and subjective. I bear in mind, as well as the maximum sentence, that the standard non-parole period is a marker for cases falling into the mid-range of objective seriousness and is relevant even for those cases outside that range.
	
	
	I have already dealt with the subjective features which require consideration.
	
	
	Although not provided as soon as practicable, the offender pleaded at a stage well before the trial. I consider a 15 per cent utilitarian discount is appropriate. It was submitted by Mr Young SC that the scale of the offender’s psychological problems, for which she has received no professional assistance, justifies the need for long term supervision to support her ability to cope in the community and reinforce her rehabilitation and that the period on parole derived from the application of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 would or might be insufficient. To the matters mentioned by Mr Young, I would add the consideration that the likelihood of the offender’s being able to re-establish a positive relationship with her children will be enhanced by an earlier release. I have concluded that there are special circumstances in the offender’s case that justify a variation of the statutory calculus and have given effect to this conclusion in the sentence which is imposed. It is true that supervision is unlikely to exceed three years, but the remaining period on parole will be a deterrent to the commission of further offences. The sentence must commence when the offender was taken into custody, namely 20 April 2014.
	


Sentence


	
	The starting point for the overall sentence is 25 years imprisonment, to which should be applied the 15 per cent utilitarian discount to which I have referred, resulting in a term of 21 years (rounded down). I impose a non-parole period of 12 years commencing on 20 April 2014 and expiring on 19 April 2026. The balance of term of 9 years commences on 20 April 2026 and expires on 19 April 2035.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 25C(1) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, I advise you of the existence of the Act and the fact that it applies to you and to this offence.

		02 November 2015",2015-10-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768089,R v Wong [2015] NSWSC 1612,"Judgment


	
	On 11 September 2006, the Prisoner killed Deng Cheng Li. On 11 September 2015, after some 2 weeks of hearing a jury convicted the Prisoner of murder. It now falls to me to sentence him. I instruct myself that any conclusions I reach must be consistent with the jury’s verdict, and that I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of any further findings I make adverse to the Prisoner, but that in the case of findings that operate by way of mitigation, it is sufficient if I am satisfied of them on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	The circumstances of and leading up to the killing were as follows.
	
	
	The Prisoner was born on 27 August 1985 and is a citizen of Malaysia. He came to Australia in March 2006 to participate in a course called mechanical engineering. Before the course was completed, he and others in it were told it could not be continued but if they continued to pay fees their visas could be extended. Somehow or other the Prisoner effected an extension of his visa, accepted a recommendation to go to Wagga Wagga and did so. In June 2006, he found work there at a Chinese restaurant called “Noodle Paradise” conducted by Mr Li, the deceased.
	
	
	The Prisoner continued working there until shortly prior to the death of the deceased, cooking, preparing food and cleaning up etc. He was paid a wage which increased during the period of his employment to $700 per week from which $100 was deducted for accommodation provided to him on the premises. In fact he and the deceased each had a bedroom behind the restaurant. One of two toilets nearer the rear had been rigged up to provide some sort of washing facilities.
	
	
	According to the Prisoner, initially his relationship with the deceased was good but it deteriorated after some time. The Prisoner contended that the deterioration was a consequence of events that happened to Mr Li during a trip to Melbourne, but certainly in the latter days of his employment, Mr Li was dissatisfied with the Prisoner’s work performance. There is evidence that suggests the dissatisfaction was justified though this may not have been recognised by the Prisoner.
	
	
	The Prisoner worked on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the 8th, 9th and 10th September. Monday was the one day in the week that the Prisoner normally had off. According to the Prisoner, on the evening of the 9th and after all the other employees had left, the deceased informed the Prisoner that Monday would be his last working day in the restaurant.
	
	
	The Prisoner’s wages were paid in cash and there was no evidence to suggest there was any formal record of them. According to the Prisoner, at the time he was given notice he had not been paid for some weeks, the deceased having said that business was bad and he didn’t have money to pay the Prisoner. In his ERISP the Prisoner said that it was two weeks for which he had not been paid. In evidence he said it was three weeks.
	
	
	On 14 August, the Prisoner had bought a computer and thereafter, except for a few days, the Prisoner had virtually no money in his bank account.
	
	
	The Prisoner said that on hearing his employment was terminated he felt angry and upset – more upset than angry because he had wanted to work until the expiry of his visa. On the Monday, the Prisoner rang Austrian Airlines to book a flight back to Malaysia and Countrylink to book a seat on the XPT to Sydney. In a recording of the latter call which occurred shortly after midday on the Monday, the Prisoner is heard to say, “I can’t pay before 5 at night… cause my boss pays me during the night time, 9 o’clock”.
	
	
	The Prisoner said that during the afternoon the thought occurred to him of tying the deceased up or having the deceased tie himself up so the Prisoner could be assured of payment, and then phoning from Sydney to ensure the latter’s release. In fact the Prisoner seems to have equipped himself with a ball of string that was found in his clothes.
	
	
	After the restaurant closed on the Monday night, the deceased drove some of his other employees home and while the deceased was away the Prisoner secreted a knife in the restaurant cool-room. His intention was to scare the deceased into complying with the tying up.
	
	
	On the deceased’s return, the Prisoner asked him for his wages. The deceased passed over a transparent bag that the Prisoner said felt as if it had only $500 in it. The Prisoner protested that that was not enough and was met with a response, “No money, the business no good”. After some minutes of argument the Prisoner noticed a bunch of coins on a table. He moved to possess them. The deceased stood and then, using two hands, pulled the Prisoner by his collar, threw the Prisoner on a bed and told him to get out of the shop and go back to his own country. The Prisoner’s account of being so handled by the deceased derives some support from the deceased’s DNA being found on the collar of the Prisoner’s shirt.
	
	
	The Prisoner was then released. He returned to his room where he thought for a time, grabbed the ball of string that was there and returned to the deceased’s bedroom, inviting him to tie himself up. The deceased told the Prisoner on at least two occasions he was crazy. The Prisoner then went to the cool room and obtained the knife. He returned to the deceased’s room, showed him the knife and again asked the deceased to tie himself up.
	
	
	The deceased responded by taking hold of a folded chair and rushing towards the Prisoner. According to the Prisoner he ran into a more open area and tripped with the deceased on top of him. The Prisoner said that the deceased’s hand was around his throat, he was being choked, his vision was dimming and, frightened that he would pass out or die, stabbed the deceased under his armpit with the Prisoner’s right hand. A little later he stabbed the deceased somewhere in the middle of his chest and said these were the only two occasions of stabbing that he remembered. After the second stabbing the deceased removed his hand and the Prisoner stood up.
	
	
	A little later the deceased collapsed and the Prisoner pulled him into a nearby toilet and then went in search of money. He took $600 to the deceased’s pocket, the $500 he had been offered and on a couple of occasions he went to the till in the restaurant, finally succeeding in opening it.
	
	
	In the midst of these activities the Prisoner also interfered with the deceased’s computer and which was controlling a CCTV system in the premises. For a time that system did not work but the computer was programmed so the system would reboot after a period. It did and the Prisoner’s acting in and adjacent to the cool room and stealing from the till were the subject of recordings that were tendered in evidence.
	
	
	The Prisoner then left the shop, boarded a train to Sydney and then boarded a flight to Malaysia. In 2014 the Malaysian Police asked him to turn himself in at a police station. The Prisoner did so, was arrested and then extradited to Australia.
	
	
	The issues raised at the Prisoner’s trial were self defence and provocation. His conviction of course means that the Crown negatived these two defences.
	
	
	I have set out the Prisoner’s version of what happened. The Crown was not in a position to contradict most of it but they did have the scene of the murder and a record of the post mortem examination. The latter revealed that the deceased had suffered 4 stab wounds to the chest, an incised wound to the right scalp, the knife penetrating the deceased’s skin and then exiting from it, other incised wounds to the left flank, left neck, probably the right upper lip and to a number of fingers on both hands. There were a number of other lesser injuries including bruising and a mild blunt force head injury. Three of the stab wounds to the chest were the cause of death.
	
	
	The crime scene revealed a deal of blood in the area behind the 2 bedrooms, indicating significant movement of the deceased after he commenced to bleed and that his body had been dragged by the Prisoner into one of the toilets, presumably with a view to concealing the body.
	
	
	It is impossible to deduce from the jury’s verdict the extent to which they accepted or rejected the Prisoner’s evidence other than his claim that he stabbed the deceased because he feared he would pass out or die. It is impossible to deduce why the issue of provocation was resolved in favour of the Crown. It may have been for a number of reasons one of which might have been because the jury did not accept that the deceased’s conduct could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the Prisoner to have so far lost control so as to have formed an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. In other words, the jury’s resolution of the provocation issue in favour of the Crown did not necessarily involve a rejection of much of the Prisoner’s evidence.
	
	
	And as the Prisoner’s actions do bear on his criminality, I am accordingly required to come to some conclusions as to what occurred. Necessarily involved in that is some view as to the Prisoner’s credibility.
	
	
	That task is not easy. For example, given the number of knife wounds to the deceased, it is difficult to accept that the Prisoner was being honest when he said that he could only recall two. There is inconsistency in the number of weeks the Prisoner said that he had not been paid. His story about tying up the deceased, which logic suggests would have required some co-operation by the deceased has a deal of the bizarre about it. It is no less bizarre if fabricated after the event. On the other hand the ball of string was present during the altercation, and became bloodied, and the evidence indicated that no such string was kept in the premises.
	
	
	Notwithstanding these matters, having listened to and observed the Prisoner, I am nevertheless disposed to accept much of what the Prisoner has said as to the events leading to his offence. I accept his evidence that he was owed wages by the deceased. I accept that he had virtually no additional funds. He would seem to have had no family or friends’ support in Wagga Wagga. It follows that the termination of his employment, and presumably the termination of the arrangement he had to live in the restaurant must have been particularly stressful. There was nothing to suggest that he was otherwise disposed to stealing and it seems to me likely that the Prisoner’s approach to the deceased on the night the deceased was killed, was to obtain what he believed to be rightfully his. It may be accepted he had earlier concealed the knife but the evidence tends to indicate he only resorted to using this when his original efforts to be paid were unsuccessful. Certainly the Crown has not proved the contrary of the matters stated in this paragraph.
	
	
	In its written submissions on sentence, the Crown described the attack on the deceased as “frenzied”. I agree. The number and nature of injuries to the deceased make it impossible to conclude otherwise. They argue for a complete absence of self-control at the time they, or at least the majority of them, were inflicted – so much so that I find it impossible to be satisfied that the Prisoner had an intention to kill as distinct from simply lashing out. Of course, the extent of his lashing out must be given full weight.
	
	
	Against this background, I turn to the statutory provisions to which I must have regard. It is not I think necessary that I dilate upon the purposes of criminal punishment or s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I can also put aside s 61(1) of that Act because I agree with the Crown that the killing of the deceased was not such as to fall within the terms of that section. Relevant however is s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900, setting out the maximum penalty for murder, viz. life imprisonment. Another provision which the High Court has indicated is to be used as a guide is the standard non-parole period which has been prescribed – 20 years, which s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act says “represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences” of its nature.
	
	
	Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act sets out an extensive list of aggravating and mitigating factors to which I am also obliged to have regard. Many have no relevance but the aggravating factors that do are:-
	



	
	The offence involved the use of violence and a weapon;
	
	
	The offence was committed in the home of the victim;
	
	
	The injury or damage caused by the offence was substantial;
	
	
	The Prisoner abused a position of trust in relation to the victim;
	
	
	The victim had some vulnerability because of his age and size, certainly relative to the Prisoner.
	



	
	The first and third of these are incidents inherent in the Prisoner’s offence or the way in which it was carried out and I take the view that they do not justify “additional regard” within the terms of the section. Of course they will be reflected in the sentence. In light of the circumstances that led to the offence, I do not regard the others as justifying more than at most, a marginal increase in penalty.
	
	
	Relevant also is that the offence involved a series of criminal acts – knife and other blows – and that there was a degree of planning not “of” but that led to the offence though I am not persuaded that the particular activities of the Prisoner in carrying out the murder were of the type to which s 21A(2)(m) and (n) are directed.
	
	
	The Crown in written submissions drew attention to a substantial number of other matters that it submitted argued for the offence being regarded as in the middle range of objective seriousness. It does not seem to me necessary to canvass all of those matters in these remarks though I should mention the last. In it, the Crown submitted that the offence was motivated by the Prisoner’s desire to eliminate rather than simply reduce, the prospect of the Prisoner being apprehended before he had an opportunity to leave Australia. For reasons apparent in what I have said above, I do not accept that this was the situation.
	
	
	I turn to subjective matters. The Prisoner was but 20 years old at the time. He has no record of previously committing criminal offences and was of good character. Based on that past and that the offence for which he is to be sentenced arose from the particular circumstances in which he found himself, I think it unlikely that he will re-offend and think that he does have good prospects of rehabilitation. Of course one must recognise that having behaved, to an appreciable degree, in an out of control and irrational way in committing the subject offence, absence of control and irrationality might manifest themselves again. However, the sentence which I must necessarily pass can be expected to have a strong salutary effect in any such situation.
	
	
	During the course of the sentencing hearing the Crown read a letter from Mei Li, the daughter of the deceased who described the emotional and financial impact the deceased’s death had had on her family. Such impacts are of course not uncommon and a Judge cannot practise long in this jurisdiction without becoming acutely conscious of them, though it certainly seems as if the impact on the deceased’s mother, paralysed from polio, has been appreciably worse than often occurs. I take account of what Ms Li has said in arriving at my decision.
	
	
	Looking only at the Prisoner’s assault on the deceased, his crime was horrendous. However, that is not the only matter to which one should have regard and when taken into account also is the Prisoner’s motivation, the fact that his crime was unpremeditated and, as I think it may be described, a consequence of his plans going wrong, it seems to me to fall below the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	That said, the punishment the law and sentencing principles require must be stern.
	
	
	Of course to be taken into account also are the Prisoner’s subjective features to which I have referred.
	
	
	The Crown referred me to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Tran v R [2011] NSWCCA 116. I have also had regard to the decisions in R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240; R v KJS [2011] NSWSC 1690; R v Maglovski (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 16; R v O’Connor [2008] NSWSC 1297 and R v O’Donnell [2009] NSWSC 42 and borne in mind numerous other decisions to which I have been party or had to consider over the years.
	
	
	Mr Todd, appearing for the Prisoner, urged a finding of special circumstances. While appreciating that this is the Prisoner’s first time in custody and having regard to the length of the period when he will be eligible for parole, I do not regard the case as one justifying such a finding.
	
	
	Kin Yee Wong, for the murder of Deng Cheng Li, I sentence you to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 16 years and 6 months commencing on 28 June 2014 together with a balance of term of 5 years and 6 months commencing on 28 December 2030. I record as the first date upon which it appears to the Court you will be eligible for release on parole is 28 December 2030.

2768096,Chen v R [2015] NSWCCA 277,"Judgment


	
	HIDDEN J: The difference between the non-parole periods imposed upon the applicant and his co-offender is certainly marked. However, in the light of the distinction between the objective criminality and subjective circumstances of the two, I agree that it cannot be said that his Honour’s discretion miscarried. I agree with the orders proposed by Adamson J.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Adamson J.
	
	
	ADAMSON J: The applicant, Wei Zhong Chen, seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed on him by Madgwick ADCJ at the District Court at Sydney on 10 October 2014 for various offences relating to identity fraud, to which he pleaded guilty.
	
	
	His Honour also sentenced a co-offender, Ke Yan Chen. However, although the sentence hearings in respect of the applicant and the co-offender began on 10 October 2014, the co-offender’s sentence was not passed until 16 December 2014, as the co-offender wished to rely on a pre-sentence report. The same counsel appeared on behalf of the applicant and the co-offender at the sentence hearings on 10 October 2014 (when the applicant was sentenced), although other counsel appeared for the co-offender on 10 and 16 December 2014. No issue was raised by the applicant about the joint representation.
	
	
	His Honour imposed aggregate sentences in respect of the applicant and the co-offender. His Honour allowed the maximum discount of 25% for the plea of guilty in both cases. An aggregate sentence of six years with a non-parole period of four and a half years was imposed on the applicant. There was no finding of special circumstances. An aggregate sentence of three years with a non-parole period of 18 months was imposed on the co-offender, following a finding of special circumstances.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	If leave is granted, the applicant relies on the following grounds:
	



	
	There is an unjustifiable disparity in the non-parole period imposed on the applicant, when compared to the non-parole period imposed on the co-offender, Ke Yang Chen.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge erred in finding that there was no basis to make a finding of special circumstances in that he failed to give adequate or proper consideration to whether the parity principle itself justified the making of such a finding.
	


The offending conduct


	
	The applicant and the co-offender were involved in dealing with confidential and personal identification information for the purpose of producing false credit cards, driver’s licences and Medicare cards to a standard that made their lack of authenticity difficult to detect. They were part of a larger operation involved in the commission of identity fraud offences. There was no evidence that either the applicant or the co-offender used or attempted to use the false credit cards that were produced.
	
	
	Because both proposed grounds concern parity, it is necessary to consider in some detail the applicant’s offending conduct by comparison with that of the co-offender. A joint statement of agreed facts was annexed to a certificate dated 28 May 2014 pursuant to s 35A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Act) (the Agreed Facts). The Agreed Facts dealt with conduct that formed the basis of the offences proceeded with, as well as those that were included on each Form 1 and were to be taken into account under s 32 of the Act.
	


The applicant’s offending conduct


	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to a total of 13 matters.
	


Offences of dealing with identification information: s 192J of the Crimes Act


	
	Six of the charges (sequences 2, 4, 7, 9, 10 and 24) were offences against s 192J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), dealing with identification information, for which the maximum penalty was 10 years and no Standard Non-Parole Period (SNPP) was prescribed. The conduct referable to each of these charges is set out in the table below:
	



	
		
			
			Sequence No.  / Time
			
			
			Conduct
			
			
			Indicative sentence
			
		
		
			
			2 / June-August 2013

			3 years
			
		
		
			
			4 / July 2013
			
			
			Dealing with identification information associated with a driver’s licence in the name of a fictitious person, David Barreti, which was used to establish the identity of a credit card holder on two occasions

			3 years
			
		
		
			
			24 / unknown but prior to seizure by police on 10 September 2013
			
			
			Dealing with identification information relating to 125 partially completed NSW driver’s licences containing names, dates of birth, addresses, licence numbers and card numbers.
			
			
			3 years
			
		
	



	
	Twelve additional matters were taken into account on the applicant’s Form 1 with respect to sequence 4 pursuant to s 32 of the Act. The matters on the Form 1 included nine offences of deal with identification information (s 192J, Crimes Act); two offences of possess equipment to make a false document (s 256, Crimes Act); and one offence of deal with property suspected proceeds of crime (s 193C, Crimes Act). The offence against s 193C of the Crimes Act carried a maximum penalty of two years; the other offences carried maximum penalties of ten years.
	


Offences of possess equipment to make false document: s 256(1) of the Crimes Act


	
	Five of the charges (sequences 12, 13, 14, 15 and 18) were offences against s 256(1) of the Crimes Act, possess equipment to make false document, for which the maximum penalty was 10 years and no SNPP was prescribed. These charges arose out of the seizure by police of items from the applicant’s unit in Riverwood on 10 September 2013 pursuant to a lawful warrant. The primary bedroom in the unit (of which the applicant was the only user) was set up as a sophisticated identification manufacturing operation. The items referred to in sequences 12, 13, 14 and 15 in the table below were found in the bedroom of the applicant’s unit at Riverwood. The items referred to in sequence 18 in the table below were found in a kitchen drawer in a unit at Beverly Hills which was the applicant’s main place of residence at the time of his arrest on 10 September 2013.
	
	
	The conduct referable to each of these charges is set out in the table below:
	



	
		
			
			Sequence No. 
			
			
			Conduct
			
			
			Indicative sentence
			
		
		
			
			12
			
			
			Possession of three card printers located inside a bedroom.
			
			
			3 years
			
		
		
			
			13
			
			
			Possession of a tipping machine (used to apply the coloured finish, usually gold, silver or black, to embossed or raised numbers or letters such as appear on genuine credit cards and Medicare cards), a laminator and three electronic embossing machines.
			
			
			3 years
			
		
		
			
			14
			
			
			Possession of 167 plastic cards with branding of various Australian institutions (including Westpac, National Australia Bank and Commonwealth Bank) and 70 non-embossed white plastic cards, some of which had a magnetic stripe.
			
			
			3 years
			
		
		
			
			15
			
			
			Possession of 578 (being the remainder of the total of 703 false NSW drivers licences found in the bedroom, once the 125 licences which had identification information on them were deducted: see sequence 24 above) driver’s licences in various states of preparation.
			
			
			3 years
			
		
		
			
			18
			
			
			Possession of 101 cards containing a design and the word “Medicare” resembling genuine Medicare cards, both in appearance and quality.
			
			
			3 years
			
		
	


Offence of possess identification information: s 192K of the Crimes Act


	
	One of the charges (sequence 22) was an offence against s 192K of the Crimes Act, possess identification information, for which the maximum penalty was seven years and no SNPP was prescribed. This charge arose out of the seizure of equipment by police from the Riverwood unit in September 2013. Several computers and associated equipment, such as hard drives and USB drives, were seized and analysed. The indicative sentence for this offence was two years.
	
	
	Among the matters revealed by analysis of the computers were the following:
	



	
		
			
			Computer
			
			
			Items found
			
		
		
			
			Toshiba laptop
			
			
			779 files which included either passport-styled photographs of men and women; pictures of false NSW drivers licences; pictures and scans of documents that recorded identification information such as dates of birth, addresses and licence numbers; software indicated that the computer was linked to the card printers seized at the premises
			
		
		
			
			Noontec Sunlite external hard drive
			
			
			3,810 files of the same nature as were found on the Toshiba laptop. Many of the files had multiple (sometimes hundreds) of layers, each of which represented a different component of a drivers licence so as to create the appearance of authenticity.

			Of these files, there were 1,300 NSW driver’s licences and 32 Victorian driver’s licences in a state of finish which would permit then to be printed onto plastic cards. Of these, 6 were identified as having been used to commit fraudulent transactions to purchase and sell motor vehicles.
			
		
	


Offence of possess false document: s 255(b)(ii) of the Crimes Act


	
	One of the charges (sequence 25) was an offence against s 255(b)(ii) of the Crimes Act, possess false document, for which the maximum penalty was 10 years and no SNPP was prescribed. This charge arose from the seizure of equipment by police from the Riverwood unit in September 2013. The indicative sentence for this offence was three years.
	
	
	The items seized included 10 credit cards in a more complete form, including three Westpac credit cards, three Commonwealth Bank cards and four National Australia Bank credit cards, all of which bore names and embossed credit card numbers. One of the credit cards bore the name “James Ashford” (referred to in sequence 7 above) and another bore the name “David Barreti” (referred to in sequence 4 above).
	


The co-offender’s offending conduct

Offences charged


	
	The co-offender was required to be sentenced for a total of eight substantive offences. There were four counts of dealing with identification information contrary to s 192J of the Crimes Act (which corresponded with sequences 4, 7, 9 and 10 for the applicant in the table above). He was also required to be sentenced for the following four offences, as a result of items seized when the police executed a warrant at his home at Burwood on 10 September 2013:
	



	
		
			
			Sequence no.

Form 1 matters


	
	In addition to the offences charged, there were seven matters on the co-offender’s Form 1, which comprised six charges against s 192J (deal with identification information), which corresponded with six of the charges on the applicant’s Form 1, and one charge of possess prohibited drug (two cigarettes containing cannabis).
	


The sentence hearing

The first day: 10 October 2014


	
	The Crown tendered the (joint) Agreed Facts and a Form 1 in respect of each of the applicant and the co-offender. The Crown also tendered the criminal and custodial histories of each. Mr Greenhill SC, who appeared on behalf of the applicant and the co-offender, tendered references in support of the applicant from his then de facto wife (subsequently legal wife) and a friend, Mr Xu, for whom he performed work as a part-time welder and references in support of the co-offender from his brother and his employer, Jimmy Dai.
	
	
	The Crown confirmed that the applicant, having been granted bail for a period, had been in custody for three months and the co-offender had been in custody since his arrest on 10 September 2013. The Crown accepted that both pleas were made at the first available opportunity.
	
	
	His Honour raised the relative culpability of the two offenders with Mr Greenhill who confirmed that he would not seek to argue that the applicant did not have an important role. Mr Greenhill also confirmed that he would not make a submission that custodial sentences were inappropriate in either case. His Honour indicated to Mr Greenhill that a sentence of eight years after a trial (that is, without a discount for the plea of guilty) “would not be too much” for the applicant.
	
	
	His Honour indicated that he did not discern any special circumstances with respect to the applicant. The following exchange occurred:
	


“GREENHILL: …I’m instructed to submit to your Honour that there are special circumstances by reason of him having a six year old daughter. Your Honour I realise the shaky ground on which I make that submission.”

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

GREENHILL: But I can’t think of any other special circumstances which would result in any mitigation of the offences.”


	
	His Honour repeated the figure of eight years for the applicant (prior to the discount for the plea) and invited Mr Greenhill to make submissions as to why any lesser sentence was warranted. Mr Greenhill accepted that the offences were committed while the applicant was on a good behaviour bond pursuant to s 9 of the Act for unrelated matters (common assault and breach of Apprehended Violence Order). He made the general submission that a starting point of eight years was too high.
	
	
	In respect of the co-offender, Mr Greenhill submitted that there were special circumstances: that he had no criminal prior history although he was 48 years old; it was his first time in gaol (and that he had been in custody since his arrest on 10 September 2013) that he had good prospects of rehabilitation; and that his was a “different case to [the applicant]”. His Honour asked why there was no pre-sentence report and was told that it had not been sought. His Honour proposed to adjourn the proceedings in respect of the co-offender to enable such a report to be obtained. His Honour indicated that he was considering an aggregate sentence of three years but that he would consider whether to find special circumstances in light of the pre-sentence report on the adjourned date, 12 December 2014. His Honour referred to the fact that by that date the co-offender would have already spent a significant time in custody and raised the possibility of his being released to parole on the adjourned date.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the hearing on 10 October 2014 his Honour delivered remarks on sentence regarding the applicant, which are summarised below.
	


The adjourned date: 12 December 2014


	
	On the adjourned date, 12 December 2014, Mr Parsons, who appeared on behalf of the co-offender on that date (instead of Mr Greenhill), tendered a pre-sentence report in respect of the co-offender. Mr Parsons submitted, on behalf of the co-offender, that he had supplied information to the applicant, who had the infrastructure in the form of manufacturing equipment to make the licences, credit cards and Medicare cards. As no transcript for 10 October 2014 was available, his Honour adjourned the sentence hearing to 16 December 2014 and passed sentence on the co-offender on that day.
	


The remarks on sentence

The remarks on sentence in respect of the applicant (delivered on 10 October 2014)


	
	His Honour recounted the nature of the offences and the maximum penalties for each. He said of the applicant:
	


“[He] may be seen as the master printer of cards of varying kinds, credit cards and cards identifying fictitious people which, to a high level of scrutiny, would pass as Medicare cards and New South Wales driver’s licences.”


	
	His Honour referred to the sophistication of the operation and to the “very substantial operational effort involved”. The sentencing judge described the applicant as “a man in his fifties who had skills and experience as a gyprock installer, a trade which can produce an acceptable living wage”. Of his criminal history his Honour said:
	


“He has previous convictions for dishonesty and minor violence and in particular was sentenced in Queensland to two and a half years imprisonment for involvement in a similar scheme. He had earlier in New South Wales been dealt with in a non-custodial way for credit card fraud too, including having custody of materials designed for making false instruments being 201 blank credit cards and on the information then put before the Court, he was dealt with merely by way of a fine of $5,000. Subsequent history suggests that he was dealt with, in fact, in an unduly lenient way then.”


	
	After describing the nature and extent of the applicant’s offending conduct, his Honour referred to the need for specific deterrence, particularly in light of his criminal history and general deterrence by reason of the harm to the community from such offences.
	
	
	His Honour noted the basis of the applicant’s submission that there were special circumstances; accepted that his incarceration and separation from his child would be “a matter of pain for him and her” but found that there was “nothing unusual” about that and refused to find special circumstances.
	
	
	The sentencing judge confirmed his view that “nothing but what I regard as a really heavy sentence is appropriate” and said that, but for the plea, for which he applied the maximum discount of 25%, a sentence of eight years with a six year non-parole period would be imposed.
	


The remarks on sentence delivered in respect of the co-offender (delivered on 16 December 2014)


	
	The sentencing judge referred to the remarks given on 10 October 2014 and incorporated them by reference into his remarks on 16 December 2014. Of the co-offender’s criminal conduct, his Honour said:
	


“To summarise the detailed material before me in relation to the present offender, he acted as a conduit, passing stolen or credibly manufactured credit card numbers and/or identification details in relation to such things as Medicare cards and drivers licences to Zhong, who would use the names and numbers he was given to forge credit cards and other identification cards for dishonest use by others.

The prisoner also had in his possession a couple of items of equipment, in particular one machine which can be used to read the data on the data strip of genuine credit cards, a process commonly known as “skimming”, and can also be used to encode the magnetic data stripe on a false credit card of the kinds which were seized from the premises associated with Zhong and the present prisoner. A small number of cards were found at Chen’s home that appeared consistent with the data required to complete credit card transactions. There were also computers and computer equipment containing files relevant to the fraudulent scheme including catalogues relating to various point of sale products including user manuals for one of the machines which the prisoner had.”


	
	His Honour found that the applicant was engaged in the fraudulent organisation at a “considerably higher level” than the co-offender and described the applicant as a real “lynchpin of the execution of the scheme”. His Honour described the co-offender’s role as not significantly higher than a mere conduit.
	
	
	The sentencing judge referred to the co-offender’s age at the time of the offending, 48, and his lack of prior criminal history. His Honour considered that due to his unhappy marriage and unsuccessful career, the co-offender started to smoke marijuana in early 2013 and that he probably became involved in the fraudulent activity “in a condition of demoralisation and hopelessness”. His Honour referred to his references and the prospects of his obtaining gainful employment on his release.
	
	
	His Honour referred to the need for parity, having regard to the sentence imposed on the applicant and considered that an appropriate aggregate sentence would be three years’ imprisonment. His Honour found special circumstances on the basis of the co-offender’s prior good character and his “above average” prospects of rehabilitation and adjusted the statutory ratio to 50%.
	
	
	The sentencing judge nominated the following indicative sentences in respect of the co-offender: six months for two offences; 18 months for five offences and three years for one offence, including the Form 1.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	Although there are two grounds of appeal proposed, in essence the applicant has one complaint. He contended that he has a justifiable sense of grievance arising from the disparity between the amount of time he is required to spend in custody (reflected in the non-parole period of four and a half years) and the amount of time the co-offender is required to spend in custody (reflected in the non-parole period of one and a half years). He submitted that the threefold length of his non-parole period was not warranted in all the circumstances and that the disparity ought to have been corrected by a finding of special circumstances in his case, since disparity provided an additional ground for finding special circumstances and altering the statutory ratio from the one prescribed by s 44(2B) of the Act.
	
	
	The applicant did not contend that his sentence was otherwise excessive; or that the sentencing judge was in error in refusing to find special circumstances on the basis put. This is consistent with the assumption, which is made where a challenge is made on the basis of parity, that the sentence imposed is otherwise correct: Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398 at [15] per Howie J.
	
	
	Nor, however, did the applicant contend that there was a disparity in the total sentence imposed on him as compared with that imposed on the co-offender. His complaint was limited to the respective non-parole periods. The point is, thus, a narrow one: whether the sentencing judge was in error in not finding special circumstances on that basis and not adjusting the statutory ratio between the total sentence and the non-parole period in respect of the applicant by reason of the non-parole period stipulated in respect of the sentence imposed on the co-offender.
	


The relevant principles


	
	The applicant relied on Tatana v R, in which this Court allowed an appeal and readjusted the ratio between the total term and the non-parole period solely on the ground of parity. In that case Tatana and others decided to steal a shipping container and its contents of 1,490 DVD players which were valued at about $1m. Of the other persons charged in connection with the theft, three, Dick, Namana and Baker, were, relevantly co-offenders. Each of the co-offenders was sentenced by Berman DCJ in November 2004 as follows:
	



	
		
			
			Offence
			
			
			Dick
			
			
			Namana
			
			
			Baker

			3 yrs/ NPP 18 mths
			
			
			3 yrs/ NPP 18 mths
			
			
			2 yrs/ NPP 1 yr
			
		
		
			
			Larceny of DVD players

			Total
			
			
			4 yrs/ NPP 2 yrs
			
			
			4 yrs/ NPP 2 yrs
			
			
			2yrs 8 mths/ NPP 1 yr 4 mths
			
		
	



	
	The starting point for each of the co-offenders with respect to the larceny of the DVD players was four years. This was discounted by 25% for Dick and Namana by reason of their pleas of guilty; it was discounted by 50% for Baker by reason of his plea and the assistance he had given to authorities.
	
	
	About a year later, on 25 November 2005, Tatana came to be sentenced by Boulton ADCJ. He had been acquitted of the two offences identified as ‘1’ and ‘2’ in the table set out above and had pleaded guilty to the offence of larceny of the DVD players. Acting Judge Boulton adopted the same starting point of four years as Berman DCJ and applied a discount of 15% for Tatana’s plea. His Honour imposed a term of imprisonment of three years with a non-parole period of two years and six months. Tatana sought leave to appeal on several ground, including, of present relevance, that the sentencing judge “did not exercise parity regarding the sentence of the co-offenders”.
	
	
	Justice Howie (Sully and Latham JJ agreeing) rejected Tatana’s argument that Boulton ADCJ ought to have found special circumstances on the basis of matters personal to Tatana. His Honour also rejected the parity complaint with respect to the head sentence for the larceny count. However, on the basis of this Court’s decision in R v Do [2005] NSWCCA 209, Howie J considered that Boulton ADCJ was obliged to consider the end result of the sentencing process and address the issue of parity before passing sentence with a view to remedying any disparity which could give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.
	
	
	Justice Howie considered that, in the particular circumstances of that case, the fact that Tatana had to spend longer in custody than his co-offenders who had committed “significantly more crime” gave rise to a relevant disparity. His Honour considered that, in order to avoid Tatana’s justifiable sense of grievance, the sentencing judge ought to have found that parity with the co-offenders amounted to special circumstances which would justify a reduction in an otherwise appropriate non-parole period.
	
	
	This Court accordingly allowed the appeal by reducing Tatana’s non-parole period to one year and nine months (from two years and six months).
	
	
	Accordingly, Tatana v R stands as authority for the proposition that disparity can, of itself, constitute “special circumstances” so as to permit a departure from the statutory ratio in s 44(2) of the Act. This is the basis on which the applicant seeks leave to appeal to this Court, and an order adjusting the statutory ratio so as to reduce his non-parole period from four and a half years, while leaving his total term intact.
	
	
	Because of the nature of the sentencing task, it is not fruitful to engage in too close an analysis of the differences between individual cases. Nonetheless an important difference between the applicant’s circumstances and that of the co-offender is that the applicant’s criminality, and corresponding moral culpability was (unlike Tatana’s) significantly greater than the co-offender. Moreover, the applicant and co-offender were sentenced by the same judge, which constitutes a separate reason why this Court ought be slow to interfere on the basis of parity: R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 at [71] per Barr and Howie JJ.
	
	
	Further, the applicant was represented by the same counsel as the co-offender. As set out above, his Honour foreshadowed, in the sentence proceedings on 10 October 2014, that the sentence that he was inclined to impose on the applicant (6 years with a non-parole period of 4 ½ years) and on the co-offender (3 years). Although his Honour did not specify the non-parole period he was contemplating for the co-offender in years or months, his Honour signaled that at least one possibility was that the co-offender would be released on parole at about the time of the adjourned hearing (December 2014). Since the applicant and co-offender had been arrested on 10 September 2013, this scenario foreshadowed at least the possibility that the non-parole period for the co-offender could be as short as 15 months (which was even less than the 18 months eventually imposed).
	
	
	Thus, the applicant’s counsel was on notice in the course of the sentence hearing of the likely sentences to be imposed on both his clients. No submission was made to his Honour that such sentences might give rise to disparity. Nor was it submitted that special circumstances ought be found in respect of the applicant on the separate basis of disparity even if his other basis for special circumstances (separation from his daughter) was rejected. I do not accept the hypothesis advanced by the applicant’s counsel in this Court that Mr Greenhill may have overlooked this matter. Nor was any suggestion made that he failed to raise it by reason of any conflict of interest between his clients.
	
	
	As was said in Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [11] (and reiterated frequently since, including in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [77]-[83] per Johnson J):
	


“It is the duty of counsel appearing for an offender at a sentencing hearing to assist the court by making relevant submissions at that time on issues of fact and law. A sentencing court is entitled to expect assistance from counsel, in discharge of counsel’s duty to the court and the client, with respect to relevant issues. ... The public interest is served by counsel discharging his or her duty to the court and the client.”


	
	Parity arguments, such as the one advanced on behalf of the applicant, do not generally fall into the category of submissions that might have been, but were not, put below as the sentence to be imposed is infrequently foreshadowed as clearly as it was by Madgwick ADCJ. However, as it must have been apparent that the parity argument was open and provided a further, and independent, ground for a finding of special circumstances, it is telling that the applicant’s counsel did not contend for it on sentence and provides some indication that the substantial difference between sentences was not thought to be unwarranted.
	
	
	In the present case, every matter of distinction between the applicant and the co-offender indicated that the applicant’s sentence ought be significantly longer. First, the applicant’s role was significantly greater; he was sentenced for a substantially greater number of offences; and the matters on his Form 1 were considerably more extensive. The greater the difference between the criminality of the applicant and the co-offender, the more difficult it is to identify and establish relevant disparity: Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49 at [30].
	
	
	Secondly, the applicant had a significant prior history, including for similar offences and was on a bond at the time of the offending conduct; the co-offender had no prior history and had a prior good character. Thirdly, the co-offender was found to have “above average” prospects of rehabilitation. Fourthly, the applicant was a recidivist whereas the co-offender was regarded as being deserving of sympathy, having fallen into criminal conduct as a result of his unfortunate personal and work circumstances which led to his recent drug-taking.
	
	
	The parity principle is fundamental to the sentencing of co-offenders. It is “an aspect of equal justice [that] like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them”: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 301 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ. I do not regard the substantial difference between the 18 months which the co-offender was required to spend in custody and the four and a half years which the applicant is required to spend in custody (being the respective non-parole periods), as amounting to more than “due allowance”. In my view, the substantial differences in charges, objective criminality, prior history, subjective circumstances and prospects of rehabilitation were not such as to make a difference of that order unwarranted. In these circumstances, I do not accept that any sense of grievance on the part of the applicant is justifiable or such as would warrant a reduction of the non-parole period.
	


Additional matter


	
	At the hearing of the appeal, this Court raised an apparent error in the commencement date of the sentence imposed by his Honour. The sentence imposed on 10 October 2014 was expressed to commence on 10 July 2013. The back-dating was intended to take account of the applicant’s three months’ pre-sentence custody. On this basis, it ought to have been backdated to 10 July 2014. The error was not identified at the time.
	
	
	However, after the imposition of the applicant’s sentence (which occurred on 10 October 2014), his Honour became aware that, although he had intended to discount the aggregate sentence by 25% for the plea of guilty, the discount was not reflected in the orders made. Accordingly, his Honour re-listed the matter for mention on 24 October 2014 in order to correct this omission. On that day, his Honour said that the sentence was back-dated “to a degree” but did not specify the date to which it was to be back-dated. The error in the commencement date specified in the order made on 10 October 2014 was not identified and, thus, was not corrected.
	
	
	I am satisfied, having regard to the material provided by the Crown, that his Honour’s reference to 10 July 2013 (rather than 2014) was an error. As I consider that, although leave to appeal ought be granted, the appeal ought be dismissed, it is appropriate to remit the matter to the District Court pursuant to s 12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) for the purposes of re-opening proceedings pursuant to s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to correct the sentencing error in the commencement date of the applicant’s sentence, which has a consequential effect on the expiry date for the sentence and the date on which the applicant is first eligible for release on parole. These corrections will require the commencement date to be changed from 10 July 2013 to 10 July 2014; the expiry date for the sentence to be changed from 9 July 2019 to 9 July 2020 and the date on which the applicant is first eligible for release on parole to be changed from 9 January 2018 to 9 January 2019.
	


Proposed orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	
	
	Remit the matter to the District Court to re-open proceedings to correct the sentencing error in the commencement date of the applicant’s sentence by ordering that:
	



	
	the commencement date be changed from 10 July 2013 to 10 July 2014;
	
	
	the expiry date be changed from 9 July 2019 to 9 July 2020; and
	
	
	the date on which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole be changed from 9 January 2018 to 9 January 2019.

2768105,New South Wales Crime Commission v Nhu [2015] NSWSC 1643,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: These proceedings were commenced by summons filed on 1 April 2015. On that day Campbell J made ex parte orders under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW), restraining the defendants from dealing with various assets in terms described in the orders.
	
	
	Today the parties have approached the Court seeking a number of things: firstly, that leave be granted to amend the summons in terms filed in Court today, and secondly, that consent orders be made disposing of the proceedings in terms which the parties have also agreed.
	
	
	Those orders provide for orders under s 10B of the Act in relation to reasonable legal expenses of the defendants agreed at $60,000; orders under s 27 of the Act for payment by the defendants to the Treasurer of the sum of $130,000 by way of a proceeds of assessment order; orders under s 10B as to sale of an interest in property of the defendants at Green Valley, the proceeds of which are to be applied in satisfaction of the proceeds assessment order, as well as for interest in accordance with s 101 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). The proposed orders also contain a number of notations, including as to costs.
	
	
	Having regard to the circumstances in which the proceedings were commenced and orders were earlier made by the Court and what the parties have now agreed in order to finalise the proceedings, I am satisfied that justice dictates that the Court's discretion be exercised to give effect to the agreement the parties have reached, by making further orders in terms which the parties have agreed.
	
	
	For those reasons, I grant leave to amend the summons in terms agreed, and make the consent orders in terms filed, which I shall mark MFI 1.

		05 November 2015",2015-11-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768106,R v Thangavelu [2015] NSWDC 390,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Saegar Thangavelu stands for sentence as a consequence of having pleaded guilty to a charge that on 7 December 2014 at Mascot in this State he did import a Tier 1 prohibited good, namely, pseudoephedrine. The quantity of the drug imported by the offender was 842 grams.
	
	
	On 7 December 2014 the offender arrived at Sydney International Airport on an Air Asia flight from Malaysia. He presented to an Australia Border Force officer for immigration clearance. He presented his Malaysian passport and completed and signed an incoming passenger card in English. That provided the offender’s name and date of birth, told the Border Force officer that his occupation was a disc jockey, that he intended to stay in Australia for four days and that the main reason for his visit was a holiday. His anticipated address in Sydney was at the Aspire Hotel in Ultimo. He answered ‘no’ to a question which required him to state whether he was bringing into Australia anything that might be prohibited or subject to restrictions such as medication, steroids, illegal pornography, firearms, weapons or illicit drugs.
	
	
	Pseudoephedrine is a form of medication. The importation of any amount of pseudoephedrine over 25 grams requires Government approval under the Customs Regulations 1926 cl 179AA and Sch 1AA. The amount of “25 grams” of pseudoephedrine is known as “the critical quantity”. That is the highest critical quantity of any Tier 1 drug. That suggests that the pseudoephedrine is considered to have the least potential for harm. However, it is common ground that pseudoephedrine can be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Shortly after presenting to the Border Protection officer the offender was directed to the baggage examination area. A Border Force officer searched the offender’s suitcase and located a toiletry bag. Contained in that toiletry bag was a bottle labelled “Royal Rose Aromatherapy Shower Cream” which was said to have a content of 1,000 millilitres. There was another bottle labelled “Johnson’s Baby Powder” which was said to weigh 500 grams. It in fact weighed 537 grams. A test of each of the two bottles tested positive for ephedrine. The bottles were then X-rayed and their contents appeared to be inconsistent with the description of the goods given on the bottles themselves. Subsequent testing found that within the “Johnson’s Baby Powder” bottle there was a plastic bag containing 398 grams of white powder. In the “Royal Rose Aromatherapy Shower Cream” bottle was a clear plastic bag also containing a white powder with a weight of 650 grams. The white powder in each bottle was subsequently analysed and it was determined that each contained pseudoephedrine with a purity of 80%. The total weight of pure pseudoephedrine was 842 grams.
	
	
	Prior to that testing the offender gave an interview to Border Force officers. The offender said that he was married with three children. Those children were said to be seven years, four years and two years old. The offender said that he worked both as a disc jockey and as a handyman. The offender said that his boss in Malaysia had paid for his airline ticket to come to Australia and for the offender’s accommodation in Australia. That is a difficult proposition to accept at face value. However, the offender then said that he gambled regularly and in fact gambled daily and was losing between $200 and $1,000 when he gambled. In those circumstances one might form the view that the offender was a gambling addict who had incurred debt due to gambling which he needed to discharge. The offender told the Border Force officers that he had packed his suitcase himself. He then went on to say that he had told his boss that he wanted to buy some toiletries to take to Australia but then another friend of his called and told him that he did not need to buy such items and that they would be given to him gratis. That friend was also a friend of the offender’s boss. One might infer that the offender’s “boss” and his other “friend” were related in drug trafficking. The offender told the Border Force officers that his friend gave him the packages in Malaysia and dropped them off to him with the other contents of his toiletry bag. The offender said that he was not planning to meet anyone in Australia and that he was coming to Australia mainly to gamble at a casino. The offender told the Border Force officers that he was travelling alone and that he did not have any friends or family in Australia.
	
	
	The offender was then arrested. He has been in custody ever since. He is two days short of having been in custody for 11 calendar months.
	
	
	The offender has elected not to give evidence, nor has any oral evidence been given on his behalf, nor, indeed, has any documentary evidence been tendered on his behalf.
	
	
	The offender first appeared before the Central Local Court on 8 December 2014. Eventually, after being served with the police brief and after lengthy conferences with his lawyers, which I wholly accept would be difficult conferences, the offender pleaded guilty at the Local Court without there needing to be a committal hearing and the offender was then committed for sentence to this Court.
	
	
	The Crown has accepted that the offender’s plea was entered “at the earliest stage in the proceedings”. The Crown case is strong. However, the offender did give an explanation to the Border Force officers, which had he not pleaded guilty, would have required a trial to ascertain whether the offender knew of the presence of the prohibited drugs in his possession when he arrived at Sydney Airport or whether otherwise he was criminally liable for the drugs that were found in his possession. In other words, the offender’s guilty plea was both an acceptance of responsibility for his crime and showed a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. In the circumstances I am prepared to allow the offender a discount for his plea of guilty at the earliest stage of the proceedings as conceded by the Crown.
	
	
	The facts before me and common sense suggest that the offender had a gambling habit, had become indebted and needed to bring pseudoephedrine into the country so that someone else could use the pseudoephedrine to manufacture illicit drugs. The offender said when interviewed by the Border Force officers that he intended to stay in Australia for four days but he had a return ticket indicating that he was to leave Australia on 9 December 2014 two days after he arrived. In other words the period that he was to be in Sydney was extremely short and probably merely reflects a window of opportunity for him to pass on to somebody else involved in drug trafficking the pseudoephedrine so that it could eventually be turned into a prohibited drug. The offender was a drug courier or drug mule. There is no evidence to suggest that he was a principal in drug trafficking, nor does the Crown submit that he was.
	
	
	The offender, I have to accept, is a man of prior good character. He has no criminal record in Australia. He had come to Australia with a visa and it is likely that he was interrogated in his application for a visa about his criminal past and that he provided some information in that regard. Whatever he said appears to have been accepted by the Australia officials concerned leading to his being given the visa to enter Australia as a tourist. In other words, there is nothing to suggest that the offender has some antecedent criminal history in his native country, Malaysia.
	
	
	I accept that he is a man of prior good character. However, to enter a country such as Australia, if one has a criminal history, is likely to lead to enquiry and search. In other words, to be a successful drug mule or drug courier, being of good prior character is a distinct advantage. The significance, therefore, of prior good character is diminished in crimes of this nature but must still be given some weight.
	
	
	The offender, as I have already stated, is a married man with three young children. There is no evidence of his having any family or even friends in Australia. He has been in gaol now for nearly 11 months. Although he is from Malaysia he is ethnically a Tamil and that is his native tongue, and I accept that it has been difficult for him to communicate with others since his arrival in Australia, and one can accept that being in the New South Wales custodial system as a “foreigner”, speaking a little spoken language in this country, would be of great shock to the offender and a cause of grave disquiet to him.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for five years and or 1,000 penalty units which at the current time under Federal law amounts to the sum $170,000. It is unlikely that the offender could satisfy any pecuniary penalty. The offence with which he is charged would extend to amounts of pseudoephedrine of much greater moment. Indeed cases to which I have been referred by solicitors for the parties indicate that one offender was sentenced for importing 5.375 kilograms of pseudoephedrine, another sentenced for importing 2.5 kilograms of pseudoephedrine. Whatever amount of pseudoephedrine was imported, if the importer was charged under s 233BAA(4) of the Customs Act 1900 the maximum penalty that could be imposed is that of five years and or 1,000 penalty units.
	
	
	All matters have to be taken into account in passing any sentence. They include, but are by no means dictated by, the quantity of the drug, the nature of the drug, the circumstances of importation, the offender’s role in the importation and the offender’s personal circumstances.
	
	
	Even for a “mere drug courier” or “mere drug mule” deterrence looms large, both personal deterrence and general deterrence. Anyone coming to this country must realise that breaking the Customs law concerning illegal or prohibited drugs and the like results in severe penalties.
	
	
	Each of the Crown and the offender have put before me three cases which it is submitted give comparable sentences.
	
	
	The first is the decision of Solomon DCJ in R v Manh Hung Nguyen (Unreported, District Court of New South Wales), a sentence passed on 23 March 2012. That offender was either 42 or 43 years old. She was female. She imported 5.375 kilograms of pseudoephedrine. His Honour imposed a head sentence of 22 months and permitted the release of the offender on recognisance after 11 months.
	
	
	The next case was R v Yan Huang [2012] NSWDC 298 a sentence passed by Letherbarrow DCJ on 7 September 2012. The offender in that case was aged 40, and was female. She had pleaded not guilty but had been found guilty at trial. That woman had imported 760.35 gram of pseudoephedrine. Her case was somewhat unusual. His Honour imposed a sentence of 12 months imprisonment with a release on recognisance permitted after seven months.
	
	
	The next case is that of R v Tram Anh Vo (Unreported, District Court of New South Wales), a decision Haesler DCJ on 23 August 2013. The offender in that case was a single mother who had pleaded guilty to importing just over 3 kilograms of pseudoephedrine. She was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment and permitted to be released on recognisance after six months.
	
	
	The next decision was R v Goh (Unreported, District Court of New South Wales), a decision of Charteris DCJ on 20 March 2014. The offender in that case was 39 years old and female. She had imported 2.5 kilograms of pseudoephedrine. His Honour imposed a head sentence of two years imprisonment and permitted a release on recognisance after 15 months.
	
	
	The next decision is that of R v Chung (Unreported, District Court of New South Wales), a sentence passed by Armitage DCJ on 6 June 2014. That offender was a 54 year old male who had imported 1.414 kilograms of pseudoephedrine. His Honour sentenced the offender to 18 months imprisonment and permitted his release on recognisance after nine months.
	
	
	The most recent of the six cases was that of R v Le (Unreported, County Court of Victoria), a sentence passed by O’Neill CCJ (Vic) on 13 May 2014. That offender was a female aged 54 who had imported 740.06 grams of pseudoephedrine. His Honour sentenced that offender to 15 months imprisonment and permitted release after eight months on recognisance.
	
	
	This offender is now 49. He was 48 years old at the time he committed the offence on 7 December 2014. He clearly has a young family. However, there is no evidence to establish that the period that the offender has already spent in custody caused the members of his family the “exceptional hardship” that must be established for the purposes of s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1914 as stated in R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522, R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405 and R v Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222.
	
	
	There is also no evidence that the offender is otherwise than in good general health.
	
	
	Under s 16A(2)(f) I am required to take into account the degree in which the offender has shown contrition for the offence. The only contrition that I can determine is that given by the plea of guilty but as I said earlier that may be because of a strong Crown case. As the offender has not given any evidence it is very difficult to make any positive finding on his behalf in this regard.
	
	
	Under s 16A(2)(k) I am required to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for his offence and in that regard I have been given written submissions by the Crown in which it has been submitted that a full time custodial sentence is the only appropriate sentence in the circumstance. I agree with that submission but it is somewhat academic bearing in mind the fact that the offender has already spent almost 11 months in custody.
	
	
	Under s 16A(2)(n) I am required to take into account the prospect of rehabilitation of the person. Again, one needs here to speculate but the speculation is probably sound. It is unlikely that the offender would seek to return to Australia carrying in his possession any prohibited substance because of his experience this time around. However, it is unlikely that in future he would be permitted to enter the country in any event because of the offence for which he currently stands for sentence. Therefore, in theory, the prospects of the offender not committing this offence again are good.
	
	
	There is really no other matter referred to in s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 that I need to consider.
	
	
	Bearing in mind all of these considerations, and applying the instinctive synthesis which one does from hearing the cases of this nature regularly, I have come to the view that the starting point for this sentencing exercise is a period of imprisonment of 20 months. I discount that because the offender’s plea of guilty to 15 months. I believe that it is appropriate in the circumstances for the offender to be released on recognisance after 11 months, that is, that he be released on recognisance on 7 November 2015.
	
	
	Saegar Thangavelu on the charge that on 7 December 2014 at Mascot in the State of New South Wales you did import a prohibited tier 1 good, namely pseudoephedrine, you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment for a term of one year and three months commencing on 7 November 2014. I order that you be released on your recognisance in the sum of $500 to be of good behaviour commencing on 7 November 2015.
	
	
	Is an order for the destruction of the substance required?
	
	
	RALPH: No, I don’t, your Honour. Thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: All right. Ms Manea, I think all I need to tell the offenders is, it’s two more days.
	
	
	MANEA: Thank you, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: The Court will adjourn.

		17 May 2016",2015-11-04 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768108,Raad v R [2015] NSWCCA 276,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ:   I agree with the orders proposed by Davies J and with his Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	HIDDEN J:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   On 9 May 2013 the Applicant was charged with firing a firearm at a dwelling house with reckless disregard for the safety of any person. The maximum sentence for this offence is 14 years imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of 5 years. He was subsequently charged with two offences of possessing a prohibited drug, being an amount of cannabis and 1.2 grams of amphetamine, and an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company.
	
	
	He pleaded guilty to the firearm offence on 3 February 2014 at Burwood Local Court and was committed to the District Court for sentence. He was sentenced by Madgwick ADCJ on 23 June 2014 after a sentence hearing involving both the applicant and the co-offender in the firearm offence, Mohamad Ojaghi, on 20 June 2014. The offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and possession of drugs were dealt with by two Form 1 documents.
	
	
	The Applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of three years and six months commencing 9 May 2013 and expiring 8 November 2016 with an additional term of two years and six months expiring 8 May 2019.
	
	
	The Applicant now appeals on one ground as follows:
	


His Honour erred in failing to give consideration to and reflect in the sentence and non-parole period the Applicant's early plea notwithstanding section 21A(3)(k) and section 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) (1999) and despite the Crown's concession that the early plea of guilty should attract a discount of 25% on sentence.

Facts


	
	The facts involving the offence may be briefly stated. The Applicant involved himself in a long-running dispute between the Hamze family and the Goktas family. That dispute commenced with Hasan Goktas stabbing Ibrahim Hamze when they were school students in February 2011. Hasan Goktas was dealt with by a custodial sentence that expired shortly before 28 August 2012.
	
	
	On 28 August 2012 Hasan Goktas was at Auburn Railway Station. He was approached by another person who made a number of phone calls that brought the Applicant and another person to the station. Those three persons then violently assaulted Hasan Goktas.
	
	
	Hasan Goktas informed his father Hakan of the assault, and the pair then travelled to the townhouse complex in which Ibrahim and Bilal Hamze lived with their mother. Hasan Goktas was shot in the abdomen and attempts were made to shoot Hakan Goktas. The Applicant was present at the complex at that time.
	
	
	On 9 March 2013 Mrs Maha Hamze, the mother of Bilal and Ibrahim, was shot outside their residence. At the time the telephones of the Applicant and the co-offender were being intercepted by the police, and tracking devices had been installed on a car that the Applicant was driving.
	
	
	On the day of the shooting of Mrs Hamze the Applicant received a phone call telling him about the shooting and that he had to do something about it. It was believed by the caller and subsequently by the Applicant and the co-offender that the Goktas family was responsible for the shooting of Mrs Hamze. In fact, the Gotkas family were not in any way involved in the shooting.
	
	
	In the result the Applicant drove with the co-offender in the front passenger seat to the Goktas residence in Auburn. The co-offender had a .45 automatic calibre pistol. As they drove past the house, with the Applicant telling the co-offender to shoot, the co-offender fired at the Goktas residence at least eight times. Some of the bullets hit the Goktas residence while others hit the house next door. At the time of the shooting there were people including children in both properties. The people who lived in the adjoining residence were not associated with the Goktas family in any way.
	
	
	The offenders were arrested on 9 May 2013. The cannabis and amphetamine were found during the execution of a search warrant at the Applicant’s premises on that day.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	In his Remarks on Sentence his Honour said that general deterrence and the necessity for a resounding denunciation of the criminality involved in the shooting demanded that condign sentences be imposed. His Honour described the assault on Hasan Goktas as appalling.
	
	
	His Honour said that there were matters in the background of the Applicant that compelled a degree of mercy. He detailed those matters. In summary they were that the Applicant’s father was a heroin addict and provided no support of any sort to the family. The children were brought up by the mother in difficult economic circumstances. The Applicant was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. His mother was unable to afford treatment so he did not have it. He was suspended from school on a number of occasions and ultimately expelled in year 9 at the age of 14. He was allowed back to school in year 10 but was expelled in the first week. He then attended TAFE to undertake training as a spray painter but was expelled from that. His Honour said, nevertheless the Applicant had shown a capacity for hard work and had the continuing support of a girlfriend of some four years.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the Applicant was born prematurely and was likely to have had impaired cognitive skills as a result of his premature birth. He took to drug use from the age of 15 to the point where at 17 he was using cannabis on a daily basis and also abusing benzodiazepines. He had unresolved feelings of hate and anger towards his father.
	
	
	His Honour noted his custody record which he said was not such as to induce great confidence for the future. That custody record shows a number of offences including drug offences.
	
	
	His Honour noted a report from Dr John Roberts who considered that the Applicant’s substance abuse problem was at the root of the Applicant’s other problems.
	
	
	Having detailed the subjective matters his Honour then said this:
	


As against the objective seriousness of the crime I take into account all the matters that his youth and very difficult background can be said to mitigate in the name of humanity the sentence that he should receive, but I cannot think that any sentence of less than six years would suffice. One should not abandon hope of rehabilitation of one so young and I do not. It is clear that if there is to be any rehabilitation it would be the result, among other things, of his proving that he is worthy of being released to parole before the expiration of the head sentence and, if his behaviour does warrant it, it is very desirable that he should have a period longer than the prima facie 25% of the sentence supervised on parole. I take into account the matters in the Form 1s and, as I indicated earlier he will be sentenced to a minimum term of three and a half years to commence from 9 May 2013 and to expire on 8 September 2016 and to an additional term of two and a half years to expire on 8 May 2019.


	
	His Honour then turned to deal with the co-offender. Having considered matters relevant to him he concluded by saying:
	


For somewhat different reasons, I think the same sentencing disposition is appropriate for him as for Raad and, as I indicated, he will also be sentenced to a minimum term of three and a half years to commence from 9 May 2013 and to expire on 8 November 2016 and an additional term of two and a half years to expire on 8 May 2019.

Submissions


	
	The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge made no reference to the plea of guilty or any discount although at the outset of his reasons his Honour referred to the committal in the Local Court. The Applicant submitted that the Reasons plainly showed an intention on his Honour’s part to allow some benefit for subjective matters. The Applicant submitted that when an allowance is made for subjective matters it appears that either the discount for the plea of guilty has been lost or the benefit of the subjective matters has been lost or subsumed in the ultimate sentence. The Applicant submitted that the result deprived the Applicant of the full benefit of the statutory entitlements under s 22 and s 21A (3)(k) of the Act.
	
	
	The Applicant relied on what this Court said in Wei v R [2015] NSWCCA 66 at [24] – [31] as to the criteria the Court should apply when seeking to ascertain whether an unspecified discount for a plea indicated that the judge did not properly take the discount into account. The Applicant submitted that the focus should be on the reasoning of the Sentencing Judge. It was important, it was submitted, for it to be known generally that a discount is given for an early plea to encourage others.
	


Consideration


	
	The sentence hearing took place on a Friday. At the conclusion of the hearing his Honour indicated what the sentences would be for the Applicant and the co-offender. He said he would give his reasons the following Monday. Those reasons were given and the sentences formally imposed.
	
	
	It is significant to note the following exchanges between counsel for the Applicant (Mr Clark) and the co-offender (Mr Radojev) on the one hand and his Honour on the other during the sentence hearing:
	


HIS HONOUR: What would be, just let me come over from the other end, if he was convicted after a trial what would we be looking at as a head sentence, of the order of eight years?

RADOJEV: Seven flashed into my mind. But somewhere - Mr Clark's has made it six to eight, so we're probably all on the same page.

HIS HONOUR: We're all on the same page.

RADOJEV: Yes. Of course then there's the 25%, we'd be saying 25% discount for the plea.

HIS HONOUR: So it brings it down to six.

RADOJEV: Yes. In fact what we say then is quite a lot of, potentially, subjective material but clearly in my respectful submission--

HIS HONOUR: You've still got to end up with a non-parole period.

RADOJEV: Absolutely.

…

HIS HONOUR: But my problem is a bit different, the prima facie non-parole period would be four and a half years.

RADOJEV: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I agree he should have a longer parole, a chance for a longer time on parole period than that.

RADOJEV: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: If I go and make, maybe anything under, certainly much under four years it offends in one sense of what the objective gravity of the crime nevertheless caused.

RADOJEV: With respect, your Honour, you're not looking at general deterrence to the same degree if you're not looking at a Muldrock type situation, it's more a matter of - because of the nature of the intellectual impairment. So that allows a degree of flexibility, I'm not saying a huge degree of flexibility but that would allow, perhaps consideration of a reduction to three or three and a half years.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

RADOJEV: Then you give him a lengthy period on parole allowing for special circumstances of perhaps another three years which would give you a head sentence of say six years which is not completely ridiculous bearing in mind the figures we're talking about, the early plea, you know, those matters, gives him say for example, and I'm only using figures, say three years inside, he's done 13 months, he's got another 17 months or something to go, he's done some period in time, there's a reason why he should be out and there's certainly a reason why he should be on a lengthy period of parole.

CLARK: Could I respectfully just adopt that position of my friend your Honour, that would be essentially, I know that we're supposed discouraged, that counsel ever suggest what length the sentence is going to be.

HIS HONOUR: I don't think that the High Court has stopped defence counsel from doing it. They seem to think Judges are unduly prone to accept what the Crown says.

CLARK: I mean I have different reasons of course than to my learned friend but they're pretty much on the same page but just so your Honour can know what I'm thinking as well, I would adoptive Mr Radojev's strategy in relation to that in my case because of the young age of my client and the first time in custody.

…

HIS HONOUR: I just think that, first of all objectively I don't think there's much to choose between them. I mean it's true that Ojaghi pulled the trigger but it's also true that Raad knew exactly what was happening and urged Ojaghi on, and they were both, you know private soldiers that acting at the behest of a sergeant or a captain or some people, and so there is that.

But looking the non-parole period, Dr Roberts, says he needs a minimum of two years which sounds persuasive but Ojaghi has consistently expressed remorse, and there is none of that from your client?

CLARK: There is in the presentence, your Honour.

…

HIS HONOUR: Yes. I don't need to hear you, subject to this, Mr Crown, there's no principle that I can discern that would require that Raad get more here as a head sentence or as a non-parole period than the other man?

CURRAN: No, your Honour, there isn't.

HIS HONOUR: All right. I see there and it's 4 o'clock and it's Friday. I will indicate for the benefit of the prisoners what I am going to do. I am going to sentence you both to a non-parole period of three and a half years dated back

to when you went into custody and an additional term of two and a half years, so that is six all up, the three and a half on the bottom, and I will give my reasons for that on Monday, the prisoners should be returned for that purpose. Counsel may be excused if they wish on that day. (emphasis added)


	
	It may be noted that neither at the conclusion of the hearing on 20 June nor when the sentence was formally imposed on 23 June did either counsel say anything to his Honour to suggest that he had overlooked the early plea.
	
	
	In RCW v R (No. 2) [2014] NSWCCA 190 R A Hulme J (with whom Bathurst CJ and Adams J agreed) said:
	


[37]   Before turning to the proceedings on sentence it is worth being clear about the utility of doing so. ""Normally this Court will not find an error of principle from interchanges between the bench and counsel that indicate an apparent incorrect appreciation of the law, since those views do not necessarily reflect a considered decision"": R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94 at [11] (Wood CJ at CL). However, there are circumstances in which there may be some utility in having regard to statements from the bench during the course of submissions; for example, when they can assist in elucidating abbreviated statements appearing in remarks on sentence: Peiris v R [2014] NSWCCA 58 at [67] (Leeming JA). In my view there is also some utility where during the course of submissions a judge exposes his or her reasoning and announces a concluded view which is ultimately maintained without any qualification of the reasoning in an immediately ensuing ex tempore sentencing judgment.

Similar statements have been made in Peiris v R [2014] NSWCCA 58 at [67] (as noted by R A Hulme J) and in R v Robinson [2014] NSWCCA 12 at [19].


	
	In my opinion, the exchanges set out above may be taken into account, not the least reason for which is that his Honour, shortly after they occurred, said that he would sentence the offenders as he had indicated in the exchange. When his Honour was discussing the matter with Mr Radojev it is clear that the 25% discount brought the notional eight years starting point to six years which was ultimately imposed.
	
	
	It cannot be said that the subjective matters have thereby been lost. The starting point of eight years is referred to after the co-offender’s subjective matters had been identified by Mr Radojev. His Honour dealt at length with the subjective matters and employed some of them in adjusting the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the overall sentence particularly for the purposes of rehabilitation as Dr Roberts had suggested.
	
	
	No assistance can be derived from Wei. It is apparent that if the sentence in that case had not been discounted for the early plea the sentence would have been manifestly excessive: see at [27] and [31]. In the present case the Applicant expressly declined any suggestion that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. Quite apart from what has already been discussed concerning the way the sentence was reached by the Sentencing Judge, the absence of any manifestly excessive sentence prevents any inference being drawn from the sentence itself that the discount was overlooked.
	
	
	In my opinion, the Sentencing Judge did not overlook nor fail to apply the discount for the early plea.
	
	
	Further, even if error is identified in the way asserted, consideration would need to be given to whether any lesser sentence was warranted. The Applicant submitted that a starting point of seven years taking into account his subjective considerations was appropriate. The 25% discount would then reduce that to an overall sentence of five years three months with a corresponding reduction in the non-parole period.
	
	
	This was a very serious offence requiring condign sentences as the Sentencing Judge observed. The eight bullets fired penetrated two houses where persons including children were present. Such offences were prevalent as the Sentencing Judge noted. The Form 1 offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm was also at a high level of objective seriousness. The Applicant’s subjective matters could only mitigate the appropriate sentence in a small way.
	
	
	In my opinion no lesser sentence than a six year sentence was warranted in all the circumstances. In dealing with the matter in that short hand way I do not overlook what was said in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601 at [43] and by R A Hulme J in Thammavongsa v Regina [2015] NSWCCA 107 at [16]-[25].
	
	
	I would propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Leave to appeal granted.

(2)   Appeal dismissed.

		04 November 2015",2015-11-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2768125,R v Fletcher [2015] NSWSC 1630,"Judgment


	
	This is an objection pursuant to s 18 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (the Act) brought by the natural daughter of the accused, Ms Andrea Parker (the applicant) (I have used a pseudonym due to her age in order to comply with s 15A of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW)), against her being called as a Crown witness in the trial of her father for the offence of murder. I rejected the objection before the jury was empanelled. The parties were content for me to provide my reasons for doing so at a later stage of the trial. This judgment constitutes those reasons.
	


Background 


	
	To state the background very succinctly, and based upon the evidence placed before me on the voir dire, the Crown allegation is that on 18 June 2014 the accused inflicted serious violence upon the deceased, Mr Paul Connell, when an argument developed whilst those two men were at the home of the deceased and a Mr Ian Cavanough, who is said to be an alcoholic. Mr Cavanough has recounted to the police that the accused was very much the aggressor, and his actions included hitting the deceased forcefully to the head with a chair.
	
	
	The applicant, who was then aged 14 and is now aged 16, was at the flat. A few days after the incident, she engaged in a recorded interview with police. In a nutshell, her position was that, although present, she did not see or hear much of what occurred. That was because she had gone outside, and was listening to music on her headphones.
	
	
	Separately, Ms Kay Henson has given a statement to police that is to the effect that the applicant gave her a different version at around the same time, and that version was more inculpatory of the accused.
	
	
	To complete the evidence placed before me, there are also monitored telephone calls from prison in which the accused expresses the firm position to his daughter and others that she should give no more statements to the police.
	
	
	I was told that the applicant has had legal advice about her objection; that she wished to maintain it; that no lawyer was available to assist her in making the objection; and that she also wished to make the objection remotely. The parties made a joint submission that s 306ZB(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) was apposite, and the application was accordingly heard in that way.
	
	
	The parties also agreed that the applicant should place matters of fact before me on oath or affirmation; again, that procedure was adopted. I asked the applicant a number of questions, and thereafter invited questions from counsel. In the event, neither of them wished to ask any questions of the applicant.
	


The objection


	
	In short, the evidence of the applicant was that it was only some months before the incarceration of her father in June 2014 that they commenced to live together. During that time, and at earlier times, they enjoyed a good relationship. There was a time when they did not see each other for many years. Since he has been bail refused, they have been in regular phone contact, but do not see each other very often at all. She gave evidence that their relationship is a close one, and she said that their relationship could be damaged if she were forced to give evidence in the Crown case against her father. She could not point to any specific way in which she thought that that could occur.
	


The positions of the parties 


	
	The position of the Crown was to oppose the objection. It was emphasised that the count in the indictment is the most serious known to law; that the applicant is an eyewitness to what occurred; that the only other witness is a person whose alcoholism could detract from the probative value of his evidence; and that, if it be the case that, as foreshadowed by defence counsel, self-defence is to be an issue in the trial, clearly the jury will need to focus sharply on precisely what occurred between the accused and the deceased. It was also said that, in all likelihood, if the witness were not compelled to give evidence, her interview and her alleged prior inconsistent statement would not fulfil the preconditions contained in s 65(2) of the Act, and therefore would not be able to be placed before the jury.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused adopted a position of neutrality on the matter. He accepted the gravity of the offence. He accepted that a Crown application under s 38 of the Act may have merit. And he frankly conceded that the absence from the consideration of the jury of the versions of the applicant could harm the interests of his client.
	


Determination 


	
	Turning to my determination, it can be seen that s 18(6) of the Act calls upon me to undertake a balancing test. It is as follows:
	


Compellability of spouses and others in criminal proceedings generally

…

(6) A person who makes an objection under this section to giving evidence or giving evidence of a communication must not be required to give the evidence if the court finds that:

(a) there is a likelihood that harm would or might be caused (whether directly or indirectly) to the person, or to the relationship between the person and the defendant, if the person gives the evidence; and

(b) the nature and extent of that harm outweighs the desirability of having the evidence given.


	
	Section 18(7) is as follows:
	


(7) Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account by the court for the purposes of subsection (6), it must take into account the following:

(a) the nature and gravity of the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted,

(b) the substance and importance of any evidence that the person might give and the weight that is likely to be attached to it,

(c) whether any other evidence concerning the matters to which the evidence of the person would relate is reasonably available to the prosecutor,

(d) the nature of the relationship between the defendant and the person,

(e) whether, in giving the evidence, the person would have to disclose matter that was received by the person in confidence from the defendant.


	
	Section 18(7) mandates a number of matters that I must consider, and it is convenient first to discuss them briefly.
	
	
	Suffice to say the offence is the most serious known to law. And the nature of the offence is an alleged bashing at which only two witnesses compellable by the Crown were present: s 18(7)(a).
	
	
	The evidence of the applicant is, to my mind, important. Even if it be correct that she was outside, and distracted by music, I consider that her truthful recollection of the crucial events of the day has a very significant part to play in the consideration of the matter by the jury: s 18(7)(b).
	
	
	It is true that, in terms of substance, the evidence admits of different interpretations. But defence counsel has accepted that, in all likelihood, s 38 of the Act will have a role to play if the applicant is called. I consider that the substance of the evidence of the applicant – that is, what she may say about the events of the day, and about her interview, and the alleged statement to Ms Henson – could be given substantial weight by the jury: s 18(7)(b).
	
	
	There is, as I have said, another witness to what occurred; namely, Mr Cavanough. His evidence is reasonably available. But one can infer that there will be a forceful defence impugning of his reliability, and perhaps his credibility as well: s 18(7)(c).
	
	
	Turning to the nature of the relationship, I accept that it is a good one. There is little to suggest disharmony or lack of love between father and daughter. It is true that, in the monitored phone calls, the accused expressed a very firm position; in the circumstances, I do not consider that that sheds an adverse light on his relationship with the applicant. In light of his position – bail refused on a charge of murder – it may well have been natural for him to wish that his daughter say nothing more to the police than she already had.
	
	
	In short, I proceed on the basis that the applicant and the accused have a good, loving, father and daughter relationship: s 18(7)(d).
	
	
	There is no suggestion that the applicant will reveal a confidential matter received from her father: s 18(7)(e).
	
	
	Turning now to the balancing exercise, the test contained in s 18(6) is not a matter of weighing the desirability of the evidence being given against the soundness of the relationship. Rather, it is a matter of weighing the former factor against the likelihood that harm might (at its lowest) be caused, directly or indirectly, to the applicant, or to her relationship with her father.
	
	
	The position of the applicant is that she felt that the relationship “may be” harmed by her giving evidence. She was not able to point to some specific harm; that is hardly surprising, in light of her youth.
	
	
	I think there is some chance that the applicant will suffer psychological and emotional harm if compelled to give evidence against her father. There is also a chance that their relationship will suffer if she is compelled to do so. Having said that, her father will surely understand that she is being compelled by the compulsory process of a subpoena and by my ruling to give evidence in his trial. The applicant will understand that as well, when she reflects upon her own conduct. As well as that, the evidence of the applicant, as placed before me on the voir dire, is not particularly adverse to the interests of the accused.
	
	
	In short, I assess the occasioning of harm, even indirectly, to the applicant or to her relationship with her father, to be reasonably possible, but the risk of it is by no means great.
	
	
	And in any event, weighing up all the mandatory factors in the statute, and considering the matter as a whole, I am soundly satisfied that the nature and extent of that potential harm does not outweigh the desirability of this important witness giving evidence about the direct facts said to constitute the act causing death in a count of murder.
	
	
	It follows that the test contained in s 18(6) of the Act has not been made out, and the objection should not be upheld. Accordingly, Ms Parker must give evidence if called by either party.

		20 April 2016",2015-11-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768145,"Xia Zhang v Office of Licensing, Gaming, Racing [2015] NSWDC 280","Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Xia Zhang appeals against the severity of a sentence imposed on her by Ms Haskett, Local Court Magistrate, on 14 September 2015 at the Downing Centre Local Court. On that day the appellant pleaded guilty to five counts of supply liquor in contravention of the standard trading period prescribed by the Liquor Act contrary to s 9(1)(b) of the Liquor Act 2007 and one count of failing to comply with the requirement made by an inspector contrary to s 34 of the Gaming and Liquor Administration Act 2007.
	
	
	The Magistrate convicted the appellant and fined her the sum of $2,500 for each of the s 9 matters, a total of $12,500, fined her the sum of $5,500 in relation to the s 34 matter and ordered her to pay the prosecutor’s costs in the sum of $7,870.70. The total amount of fines and costs was $25,870.70.
	
	
	The appellant is the licensee of a packaged liquor licence operated by a business known as Harbourside Cellars which is situated in the Harbourside Shopping Centre at Darling Harbour. On the appeal Mr Parsons appeared for the appellant and Mr Brasch appeared for the Prosecutor.
	
	
	Section 11 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act provides that any person who has been sentenced by the Local Court may appeal to the District Court against the sentence. Section 17 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act provides that an appeal against sentence is to be by way of a rehearing of the evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings although fresh evidence may be given in the appeal proceedings. Section 22 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act provides that the District Court may determine an appeal against sentence by setting aside the sentence, varying the sentence or by dismissing the appeal.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the s 9 offence is 100 penalty units, $11,000 or imprisonment for a period of 12 months or both. The Court may not impose a monetary penalty of more than 50 penalty units, that is $5,500 unless the Court is satisfied that a higher penalty is warranted. The prosecution did not submit that there were factors warranting the imposition of a higher monetary penalty or a period of imprisonment. The Court may also impose conditions on the licence or take other action against a licensee pursuant to s 147 of the Liquor Act 2007. The prosecution did not seek any orders by reference to this provision.
	
	
	The s 9 offence is a three strikes offence pursuant to s 144B of the Liquor Act 2007. A first strike will be incurred in respect of the licence if a licensee is convicted of a prescribed offence. The second strike will be incurred if the Secretary of the Department of Trade decides that a second strike should be incurred because of the seriousness of any harm that may have resulted from or been associated with the commission of the offence. A strike comes into force on the day on which the offence was committed and expires on the day occurring three years later.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the s 34 offence is a fine of 100 penalty units or $11,000. The prosecution tendered a folder of documents labelled Court Bundle which contained the following documents and was marked exhibit A on the appeal, notice to appeal, schedule of Court attendance notices and penalties imposed, statement of agreed facts, prosecutor’s submission on sentence before the Local Court, character references on behalf of the appellant and the Court attendance notices.
	


AGREED FACTS


	
	The agreed facts can be summarised as follows. On 24 February 2014, legislative changes were introduced to require that the packaged liquor outlets to cease trade at 10pm. Notice of the legislative change was publicised by the Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing to licensees and industry associations.
	
	
	The appellant was appointed the licensee of Harbourside Cellars (the store) on 2 March 2012. At about 10pm on 6 February 2015, Inspector Wise and Compliance Officer Williams (together the officers) attended Harbourside Shopping Centre and conducted surveillance of the store. At this time the officers observed that the store had the roller door up, the lights on and an array of stock on display at the front entry.
	
	
	At about 10.15pm the officers entered the store and purchased two bottles of wine. The officers were served by the appellant. At about 10.25pm, two females entered the store and left a short time later carrying bottles in brown paper bags. Shortly afterwards, the officers re-entered the store and identified themselves to the appellant. The appellant told them that her English was poor and asked them to telephone her daughter Margaret. Compliance Officer Williams then had a conversation with the appellant’s daughter.
	
	
	Inspector Wise requested the till records for purchases after 10pm on that night. The appellant produced three receipts and they were seized by the inspector and a field receipt issued. Inspector Wise then issued a notice to produce pursuant to s 21 of the Gaming and Liquor Administration Act 2007 requiring a copy of all till records for 6 February 2015, copies of all EFTPOS receipts for 6 February 2015 and CCTV footage for 6 February 2015 between the hours of 11am and 11pm.
	
	
	The appellant informed the officers on 6 February 2015 that the CCTV footage did not record and was limited to live viewing. The officers attended the Harbourside Shopping Centre security office and reviewed some footage. A security officer told the officers that he had witnessed the store remain open past 10pm on weekends in the past.
	
	
	On 9 February 2015, the officer served a notice to produce on the security officers to produce CCTV footage for the store of 24 January 2015, 30 and 31 January 2015, 4 February 2015 and 6 February 2015 between the hours of 9.45pm and 12am. The CCTV footage produced demonstrated the store was open past 10pm on those dates.
	
	
	On 9 February 2015 the appellant failed to produce the documents required by the notice to produce issued on 6 February 2015. The officers thereafter on a date unknown seized the till sale system for three days. The sales past 10pm on the relevant dates demonstrated the following: 24 January 2015, seven sales with the latest being at 10.39pm; 30 January 2015, six sales with the latest being at 10.33pm; 31 January 2015, six sales with the latest being at 10.19pm by till receipt and 10.34pm by CCTV footage; 4 February 2015, one sale 10.15pm; 6 February 2015, six sales 10.20pm.
	
	
	I have had regard to the tills receipts for the purpose of assessing the last sale that took place for the each of the s 9 offences because there is an unexplained discrepancy in the trading figures on 31 January 2015. I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the store had traded later when there is a reasonable possibility that, for example, there could have been a time difference between the till sales system and the CCTV system.
	
	
	On 19 March 2015 the appellant participated in an electronically recorded interview with suspected person (ERISP) with the assistance of a Mandarin interpreter. The appellant made full admissions in the ERISP. When asked why she kept the store open past 10pm she stated:
	
	
	“Lots of my clients are staff working in the shopping centre, that’s why I would close the shop later.”
	


THE APPELLANT’S EVIDENCE


	
	The appellant and her daughter, Margaret, gave evidence before me on 4 November 2015 and were cross-examined. The evidence given on behalf of the appellant can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	In 2008, Margaret came to Australia on a student visa. A short time later her father purchased the store. Margaret’s boyfriend was the original licensee. In 2011, the appellant came to Australia with her other two children who are now 11 and 12 years of age. In 2012 the appellant became the licensee of the store. The appellant’s husband operates a nursery business in China and resides there. He visits Australia for extended periods when he can.
	
	
	The appellant and Margaret both work in the store and it employs one casual employee. In the financial year of 2015, they both earned a wage of approximately $20,000 gross and the casual employee was paid $17,000 gross.
	
	
	In 2014 significant construction work commenced at Darling Harbour with the demolition of the exhibition and conference centre. This has caused significant downturn in the store’s trading that has resulted in profits of approximately $15,000 in the financial year for 2014 and $2,000 in the financial year for 2015. The appellant’s husband has injected a further $170,000 into the store to keep it afloat until the construction work at Darling Harbour is finished at which time it is hoped that the business will recover. At the beginning of 2015, the casual employee took leave to return to China. As a result the responsibility for closing the store fell to the appellant.
	
	
	The appellant kept the store open in part to allow other employees at the shopping centre to purchase liquor after they had finished work at 10pm. A number of these customers were her friends and she would speak to them when they came in. The appellant accepted that she would also sell to anyone else who came into the store at that time.
	
	
	Part of the store’s business came from supplying liquor to a number of restaurants in the shopping centre when they ran short of particular liquor supplies. During the period that the officers seized the till from the store, the store lost this trade because it could not provide a receipt for the restaurants for these purchases. For the contraventions involved in the section 9 offence, the total amount of sales after 10pm involved a turnover of approximately $1,000.
	
	
	The appellant has a unit in Sydney in her name that is subject to a mortgage. The mortgage and other required living expenses are paid for by her husband. Neither the appellant or Margaret appreciated the seriousness of not closing the store at 10pm as required.
	


GENERAL SENTENCING PRINCIPLES


	
	I have had regard to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provides relevantly:
	


“The purposes for which a Court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows:

to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

to make the offender accountable for his or her actions and

to denounce the conduct of the offender”.


	
	The Court must specifically take into account the matters listed in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 that are relevant and known to the Court. Sentencing is not purely a logical exercise and there is unavoidable difficulty in giving weight to each of the purposes of punishment, the various purposes overlap.
	
	
	An appropriate sentence is to be determined after consideration of the objective and subjective circumstances bearing in mind that the basic principle of sentencing law is that a sentence imposed by a Court should never exceed that which can be justified as appropriate or proportionate to the gravity of the crime considered in light of its objective circumstances.
	
	
	A proper understanding of the purpose of creating an offence is assisted by consideration of the objects of the statute. The seriousness of the offence is also eliminated by the nature of the statutory provision and its place in the statutory scheme. The objects of the legislation are set out in s 3(1)(a) of the Liquor Act 2007. In order to secure its objects, persons including licensees who exercise functions under the Liquor Act are pursuant to s 3(2) required to have regard to:
	


“The need to minimise harm associated with misuse and abuse of liquor (including harm arising from violence and other anti-social behaviour, the need to encourage responsible attitudes and practices towards the promotion, sale, supply, service and consumption of liquor, the need to ensure that the sale, supply and consumption of liquor contributes to, and does not detract from, the amenity of community life. “


	
	The grant of a licence to a licensee is a privilege. The use of the criminal law ensures the credibility of the regulatory system. The Court must have regard to the objective harmfulness of the defendant’s actions including actual harm, the potential for harm and foreseeable risk of harm.
	


THE OBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCES


	
	The proportionality principle requires that a sentence should neither exceed nor be less than the gravity of the crime having regard to the objective circumstances. At common law the term “objective circumstances” was used to describe the circumstances of the crime. The gravity of the offence was assessed by reference to its objective seriousness. The task requires the Court to consider where in the range of conduct covered by the offence the conduct of the offender falls. This assessment will generally indicate the appropriate range of sentences available which will reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed and set the limits within which a sentence proportional to the criminality of the offender will lie.
	
	
	The sentencing judge should take account not only of the conduct that actually constitutes the crime but also such of the surrounding circumstances as are directly related to the crime and properly regarded as circumstances of aggravation and litigation.
	


THE S 34 OFFENCE


	
	The matters relevant to the s 34 offence are as follows. The notice to produce issued to the appellant on 6 February 2015 allowed until 9 February 2015, a period of three days (of which two were not business days) for compliance with it. That period was only a reasonable time for compliance by reason of the plea of guilty. Objectively viewed, it was far too short and there was no demonstrated need for urgency. The documents required to be produced were of marginal relevance to the offence that was being investigated.
	
	
	The officers had on their evidence purchased liquor from the appellant at 10.15pm and they had seized three till receipts for purchases after 10pm on 6 February 2015. I cannot see the relevance of the documents requested by the notice to produce except insofar as they related to events saying after 9.45pm on 6 February 2015. In addition the officers had been told on the night and informed themselves that the CCTV footage was not being recorded.
	


THE SECTION 9 OFFENCES


	
	Matters relevant to the s 9 offences are as follows. The offences demonstrated some intentional disobedience of the law. The law requiring provided packaged liquor outlets to cease the supply of liquor at 10pm was introduced as a harm minimisation initiative. There was no actual harm and very little scope for potential harm from the commission of the s 9 offences. The offences occurred over a two week period and at worst involved a 40 minute transgression of the trading hours.
	


DETERRENCE


	
	General deterrence is relevant to this offence. The prosecution submit that this is potentially the first prosecution for offences relating to trading outside the authorised period after the introduction of the legislative changes in February 2014. There is also some need for specific deterrence in respect of this matter as there was more than one transgression over a relatively short period of time.
	
	
	The need for specific deterrence is lessened by reference to the steps that the appellant has taken after the offence to close the doors of the shop at 9.45pm to ensure that a further transgression in the future does not occur.
	


AGGRAVATING FACTORS


	
	The s 9 offences each involved a series of criminal acts pursuant to s 21A(2)(m) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The prosecution chose to proceed with representative charges. They involved between one and six supplies of liquor contrary to the licence on each of the relevant dates. I will exercise some caution in applying this aggravating factors because the prosecution could have proceeded with a discrete count in respect of each supply after 10pm but chose note to. Accordingly there is a degree of double counting inherent in this aspect of the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The s 9 offences were committed for financial gain ,s 21A(2)(o) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The incident showed that there was about $1,000 inclusive of GST in sales that took place after 10pm on the dates of the s 9 offences. On the basis of two years of trading figures supplied and the financial statements for 2014 and 2015 the percentage of net profit to total trading income was 1.67% in the financial year of 2014 and 0.25% in the financial year of 2015.
	
	
	The range of profit based on turnover excluding GST would have been in the vicinity of $2.27 and $15.18 for all of the sales that took place after 10pm. The financial gain was negligible and that should be reflected in the weight given to this aggravating factor.
	


MITIGATING FACTORS


	
	The injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was not substantial. The sales recorded after 10pm on the dates of the s 9 offences were not likely to adversely affect the harm minimisation objective of the legislation. Most of the sales related to a relatively small quantity of liquor.
	
	
	The appellant does not have any prior convictions. The appellant was a person of good character. The appellant tendered references from a number of people known to her. Each of the referees attested to her good character and of her diligence ordinarily applied to her functions as a licensee. The appellant is unlikely to reoffend.
	
	
	I am satisfied on the basis of the appellant’s evidence that she has taken steps that will prevent her from reoffending. I also accept her evidence that she became responsible for closing the store as a result of the unavailability of the casual employee. I am satisfied that she now understands the importance of closing the store in accordance with her legal obligations as a licensee.
	
	
	The appellant has good prospects of rehabilitation. In this matter it follows from my finding that the appellant is unlikely to reoffend and that she has good prospects of rehabilitation with respect to the matters now before the Court.
	


THE APPELLANT HAS DEMONSTRATED REMORSE


	
	The appellant has accepted responsibility for her actions and taken steps to ensure that the store closes by 10pm by introducing a practice of closing the front door at 9.45pm and requiring customers already in the store to leave by 10pm. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that she has demonstrated genuine contrition and remorse.
	
	
	The appellant entered a plea of guilty at an early stage of the proceedings before the Local Court. The appellant is entitled to discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea. The extent of the discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10% to 25% but that is only a guide. The primary consideration of determining where the range of the particular case falls is the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount. The plea also indicates remorse.
	
	
	The discount given for the plea of guilty can result in a different type of sentence being imposed. The plea was entered on the second occasion at the Local Court and I am satisfied that it was an early plea.
	
	
	In the circumstances I propose to allow a discount of 25% on the otherwise appropriate penalty for the utilitarian value of the plea.
	


OTHER MATTERS


	
	s 21A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 allows the court to consider other relevant matters. In this case it is appropriate to take into account the appellant’s cultural background as relevant to penalty. She is 53 years of age and I am satisfied that the s 9 offences occurred at least in part by reference to a work ethic arising from her cultural background.
	


CONSIDERATION OF THE S 34 OFFENCE


	
	The objective seriousness of the objective 34 offence was so low as to be almost negligible because the time allowed for compliance was far too short and the documents requested were not properly required by the officers to complete the investigation into the offence of trading past 10pm on 6 February 2015. The commission of the offence was contributed to by the appellant’s poor English skills of which the officers were fully aware. The circumstances are such that I would deem it I deem it inexpedient to inflict any punishment. on the appellant for this offence.
	


SECTION 9 OFFENCES


	
	The s 9 offences arose by reason of the casual employee of the store being absent and the responsibility for closing the store falling to the appellant. For the reasons I have given that I am satisfied that the late trading of the store arose from the appellant’s desire to be available to other employees in the Harbourside shopping centre and her desire to speak to them as friends on these occasions. I do not accept the late trading of the store was motivated by greed.
	
	
	The offences should be viewed as a continuing course of conduct, that is, a disregard for the law for approximately 14 days. The situation should be distinguished from one where there had been an earlier conviction or contact with the authorities followed by continuing disobedience.
	
	
	The appellant is a 53 year old woman who immigrated from China in 2011, I am satisfied that the offences occurred from a misplaced sense of loyalty to other people employed at the shopping centre and possibly work ethic rather than financial gain. I am satisfied the appellant has learnt from the experience of being charged and being dealt with by the courts.
	
	
	The business has suffered considerably from the construction work at Darling Harbour that commenced last year and is expected to complete in late 2016. The downturn in trade has required the appellant’s husband to inject further considerable funds into the business to keep it afloat until the construction work ends.
	
	
	The imposition of large fines and costs on the appellant would require that punishment to be borne at least in part by the appellant’s husband and her children who are of school age.
	
	
	The s 9 offences are regulatory offences and would ordinarily be dealt with by way of an imposition of a fine. For the two most serious offences of 24 January 2015 and 30 January 2015 the appropriate fine would be $1,100. For the other offences the appropriate fine would be $550 per offence.
	
	
	The appellant and her daughter gave evidence that the appellant has a limited capacity to pay. The appellant lives in Sydney with two children of school age. She works in the business and was paid a wage for the last two financial years of approximately $20,000. Her daughter works in the business and is paid approximately the same. She has employed a casual employee who is paid slightly less.
	
	
	The appellant’s husband runs a business in China and resides there. The money to purchase the business and also to keep it afloat comes from the appellant’s husband. The appellant has an apartment in Sydney in her name which is subject to a mortgage which is paid for by her husband.
	
	
	I am required to have regard to s 6 of the Fines Act 1996 before imposing a fine. Where an offender seeks to have a fine reduced on the basis of a limited capacity to pay he or she bears the evidentiary onus of convincing the Court that it should exercise its discretion to limit the amount of the fine. The offender’s capacity to pay is relevant but not decisive, Jandideh v R [2014] NSWCCA 178, para 16. A substantial fine may still be warranted as a result of the seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence.
	
	
	On the basis of the evidence I accept that the appellant has a limited capacity to pay any fines that may be imposed or the prosecution’s costs. A sentence must always be linked to the particular circumstances of the offender as well as the particular circumstances of the offence. A sentence derives its character of justice or injustice from a combination of those two factors.
	
	
	The principle of totality should be applied in the context of this case. The s 9 offences are of course a single course of conduct. The totality principle is designed to ensure that aggregate penalties are not oppressive or crushing. I must have regard to the prosecution’s costs as part of the financial penalty imposed.
	
	
	The prosecution seeks an order for costs in the sum of $7,870.70. The appellant contends that is too high and is not just and reasonable. I have had regard to the accounts that were tendered in the Local Court. In short there were fees charged for the drafting of the court attendance notice in the sum of about $3,000. Those charges can clearly not be justified.
	
	
	Taking into account all of the matters referred to in those accounts and progressed the matter before the Local Court I would assess a just and reasonable amount for the prosecution’s costs in the sum of $4,000.
	
	
	In assessing penalty I have also taken into account the extra curial punishment involved in the loss of trade for the three day period when the till system was seized, together with the fact that a strike will be incurred against the licence that will last for a three year period. The extra curial punishment of the strike provided for by the Liquor Act will serve the purpose of ensuring that the appellant is compliant with the Liquor Act in the future.
	


PENALTY


	
	In relation to the s 34 offence the Court finds the offence proven. Because of the trivial nature of the offence and the circumstances of it, having reference to the objective circumstances which I have outlined, together with the appellant’s lack of understanding of English, I deem it inexpedient to inflict any punishment. The charge is dismissed under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	In relation to the s 9 offences, taking into account all the relevant matters, including the objective seriousness, deterrence, totality and capacity to pay, the appropriate penalty is one that involves a total financial penalty of $4,000.
	
	
	Accordingly, I intend to deal with the various offences as follows:
	
	
	In relation to the offence of 24 January 2015 the appellant is convicted. Pursuant to the terms of s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I impose no further penalty.
	
	
	In relation to the remaining s 9 offences the Court finds the offences proven. Because the offences were a continuing course of conduct that is dealt with by reference to the conviction in respect of the matter occurring on 24 January 2015, together with the order I intend to make for costs, I deem it inexpedient to inflict any punishment. Those charges are dismissed under section 10(1)(a) of the Crimes (Sentence Procedure Act) 1999.
	
	
	I order that the appellant pay the prosecution’s costs in the sum of $4,000.

2768147,R v Fletcher (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1692,"ex tempore Judgment


	
	The Crown has sought to cross-examine the witness Andrea Parker (I have used a pseudonym due to her age to comply with s 15A of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW)) about a prior inconsistent statement that she is said to have made to a Kay Lorraine Henson. That prior inconsistent statement is recounted at paragraph 20 of Ms Henson’s statement of 3 September 2014, which was tendered some days ago on the voir dire, and became Crown voir dire exhibit E.
	
	
	The application is made pursuant to s 38(1)(c) of Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Suffice to say, it is proposed to cross-examine Ms Parker about what it is Ms Henson says Ms Parker said to her very shortly after the alleged offence.
	
	
	With the assistance of both counsel, I have looked to the mandatory matters that I must consider in ss 38(6) and 192 of the Evidence Act. The transcript will show my analysis of those. But, to repeat it very briefly, defence counsel has been on notice for some weeks that this application is on foot: s 38(6)(a). Separately, it is clear that defence counsel, who will cross-examine after the Crown concludes her cross-examination pursuant to s 38, will inevitably be asking questions about this very topic: s 38(6)(b).
	
	
	Separately, turning to s 192, I think that there is a potential for this questioning to add to the length of the proceedings, but by no means unduly: s 192(2)(a).
	
	
	To my mind, permitting the Crown to explore with Ms Parker what she is alleged to have said to Ms Henson does not occasion any unfairness to the accused or the witness: s 192(2)(b).
	
	
	I think that the evidence is important, in that it is the Crown case that it was at that very time under discussion– namely, when Ms Parker and her father, the accused, visited the deceased and Mr Cavanough - that the act causing death occurred: s 192(2)(c).
	
	
	The proceedings are a trial for the most serious offence known to law: s 192(2)(d).
	
	
	Finally, there is no alternative way forward (in terms of logistical steps or directions) other than, to my mind, cross-examination: s 192(2)(e).
	
	
	Ultimately, Mr Ainsworth for the accused did not seek to oppose vigorously this particular application, whilst reserving his right with regard to other applications, and also seeking to have, as soon as reasonably practicable, notice of all applications of this nature that the Crown might be making.
	
	
	I think it is appropriate that this limited application pursuant to s 38 be granted now. The Crown has foreshadowed others but, to my mind, the questioning with regard to this topic could possibly inform the determination with regard to other topics. The parties, I understand, are content to adopt my suggested process of conducting the cross-examination pursuant to these applications seriatim.
	
	
	For the time being then, I grant leave to the Crown to cross-examine Ms Parker about whether she has at any time made a prior inconsistent statement, namely to Ms Kay Henson as recounted in paragraph 20 of voir dire exhibit E.

		20 April 2016",2015-11-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768153,JP v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2015] NSWSC 1669,"Judgment


	
	On or about 4 October 2014 a break-in occurred at a residential premises in Dubbo. On 8 October 2014 the plaintiff in these proceedings, JP, was charged with aggravated breaking and entering with intent to commit a serious indictable offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The circumstance of aggravation was knowledge of persons present in the dwelling house while the break and enter was taking place (Crimes Act, s 105A(2A)).
	
	
	At all material times JP was under the age of eighteen years. Sub-section 15A(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 prohibits the publication of his identity.
	
	
	The hearing of the charge took place over three days in the Children’s Court sitting in Dubbo. On 27 January 2015 JP was convicted. On 16 February 2015 the presiding magistrate imposed a six month control order under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. The control order commenced on 8 January 2015 and has now expired.
	
	
	JP appeals his conviction to this Court under Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the “Review Act”). The defendant to the appeal is the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (the “Director”). The operation of Part 5 is discussed below but, for present purposes, it suffices to note that JP is only entitled to appeal as of right on a ground that involves “a question of law alone” and must seek leave to appeal on a ground that involves any question of mixed law and fact or of fact.
	
	
	A number of grounds of appeal were raised on JP’s behalf. They are addressed below. However at the core of his appeal is a contention that the evidence of a fingerprint expert was inadmissible because there was no or insufficient explanation of the reasoning process that justified his conclusion that a fingerprint taken from the scene of the break-in was identical to JP’s fingerprint. Without a conclusion that the fingerprints were identical, a conviction could not be sustained.
	
	
	For the reasons set out below I consider that the certificate provided by the prosecution’s fingerprint expert did not provide any reasoning sufficient to support the admissibility of the expert’s opinion, but the oral evidence of the expert rectified that discrepancy. Accordingly the challenge to the admissibility of the fingerprint expert’s opinion fails. Also, I reject JP’s challenges to the sufficiency of the reasons given by the presiding magistrate for receiving the expert certificate and the reasons for finding JP guilty. Otherwise I reject the balance of JP’s grounds of appeal.
	
	
	Before I address the grounds of appeal it is necessary to describe the events surrounding the break-in, the course of the hearing, the presiding magistrate’s judgment and the scope of the appeal.
	


The break-in


	
	Very early on the morning of 4 October 2014 the two elderly residents of a unit in a retirement village were awoken by what one of them described as “light ruffling noises”. They awoke to see a young male inspecting the contents of a bed-side drawer. One of them screamed and the intruder ran out the back door. The residents discovered that every room in the unit had been disturbed and a number of items and cash had been stolen. Beyond stating the age of the offender as between 15 to 17 years, the residents could not describe him other than to state that he wore “dark clothing”.
	
	
	The police were called. They attended and took photographs. Later that morning a crime scene officer attended the scene. She was able to develop three prints, two from the exterior surface of the bathroom window, described as “W1” and “W2”, and a third from the side of a blue china jewellery box described as “W3”. A preliminary examination of the prints led to the police forming a suspicion that JP and another male committed the break-in.
	
	
	On or about 18 December 2014 Detective (Technical) Sergeant Worboys from the Forensics Services Group attached to the Dubbo Crime Scene section signed a document entitled “Certificate of Expert Evidence”. He recited his qualifications in the area of fingerprint analysis and his retrieval of photographic images of two fingerprints and one palm print taken from the victims’ home, described as “Graph W1”, “Graph W2”, and “Graph W3”, and fingerprint impressions of JP. The substantive part of his certificate stated:
	


“6.   I also retrieved from the SAGEMTM fingerprint computer a set of fingerprint impressions in the name of [JP] born […] This set of fingerprint impressions are shown to have been taken on 8th October 2014 …

7.   During the course of my daily duties, I carefully compared all the finger and palm impressions appearing in the photographs bearing Forensic Case Number 2819499 with the finger and palm impressions of [JP] born […] as appearing on the fingerprint form by placing those photographs one at a time side by side with those finger and palm impressions and referring backwards and forwards between them. I compared pattern type and ridge flow, friction ridge characteristics, their relative positions to each other and the number of intervening ridges between those characteristics, that is the finger or palm prints appearing in the photographs bearing Forensic Case Number 2819499 against the finger or palm impressions of [JP] born […] as appearing on the fingerprint form. The comparison process was carried out systematically and sequentially until all available friction ridge detail had been compared between the finger and palm impressions appearing in the photographs bearing Forensic case Number 2819499 and the finger and palm impressions of [JP] born […] as appearing on the fingerprint form.

8.   Based wholly or substantially on my specialised knowledge and belief I am of the following opinion;

   ●   Graph W1 is identified to another person

   ●   Graph W2 is identified to another person

   ●   Graph W3 is identified to the Left Thumb of [JP] …

9. That is to say the impressions appearing in the photographs bearing Forensic case Number 2819499 and labelled W3 are made by one of the same [JP] born ...

10.    I hereby give notice under the Criminal Procedures Act 1986; the proposed exhibits which have been indicated in this certificate may be inspected at Dubbo Crime Scene Section, 45 Erskine Street, Dubbo at a mutually agreeable time.”

The hearing


	
	At the commencement of the hearing on 13 January 2015 an issue arose as to the late service of Sergeant Worboys’ certificate. It is not necessary to describe the detail of that debate other than to note that the presiding magistrate was advised by the police prosecutor that without the fingerprint evidence the “prosecution case must necessarily fail”. His Honour then addressed a challenge to the admissibility of the certificate. Citing the Court of Appeal’s judgment in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305; 52 NSWLR 705 (“Makita”) it was submitted on behalf of JP that in substance all that was provided was a “bare opinion” and that the certificate did not provide “the trier of fact with criteria enabling evaluation of the validity of the expert’s conclusions” (Makita at [59] per Heydon JA).
	
	
	His Honour rejected the application. His Honour’s reasons for doing so emerge from the transcript of argument which reveals that his Honour engaged with the point being made. Thus his Honour stated:
	


“… hasn’t he in paragraph 7 [said] what he’s actually done comparisons, the pattern type, ridge flow, friction ridge, characteristics, relative positions to each other and a number of intervening ridges, compared all those to the material to the palm impression of the young person says he’s done it all systematically and everything else based on that, he’s used the termination ‘based wholly [not transcribable] … specialised knowledge and belief on the following opinion. Now it’s a bit clumsy but in terms of what he said perhaps statements which are read based on there’s comparisons in paragraph 7 but he’s set out what his actual comparisons are and how he’s come to that conclusion. Perhaps a bit clumsy but it’s there.”

….

“… In this particular matter we have Sergeant Worboys doing the actual investigation and he – I think he sufficiently for the purpose of these proceedings he’s sufficiently set out in paragraph 7 what he has done to come to that determination.

…

I think it, as I said it barely makes it but in my view for these proceedings it’s sufficient …” (emphasis added)


	
	The matter then proceeded with the tender of the police brief. The only witness called to give oral evidence was Sergeant Worboys. In his evidence in chief he adopted his expert certificate which, consistent with his Honour’s ruling, was admitted into evidence.
	
	
	Sergeant Worboys was cross-examined over the balance of the hearing time available on 13 January 2015. His cross-examination continued on 15 January 2015, and concluded on 27 January 2015 when he was re-examined. He was the only witness called. Four points should be noted about Sergeant Worboys’ oral evidence.
	
	
	First, when asked what his level of confidence in his opinion set out in [9] of his certificate was Sergeant Worboys stated “100 per cent”.
	
	
	Second, a number of matters pertinent to the methodology of fingerprint analysis were raised with Sergeant Worboys, including that the level of detail in fingerprint terminology is classified as “level 1 detail, level 2 detail and level 3 detail” although Sergeant Worboys stated that he never used level 3 detail, the quality of fingerprint yielded by a known print recorded in a police station compared with latent prints being fingerprint impressions taken from crime scenes, the nature of ridge characteristics, his knowledge of the contents of the New South Wales police force’s Fingerprint Training and Research Unit Learning Guide dated October 2014 and his (lack of) knowledge of the effect of Resolutions of the International Association of Fingerprint Identification.
	
	
	Sergeant Worboys was subject to sustained criticism for assuming that no two human beings could have identical fingerprints when that assumption was not set out in his certificate and where a resolution of the International Association of Fingerprint Identification has stated that it is impossible to prove.
	
	
	Third, a number of the questions expanded upon the approach that Sergeant Worboys adopted in determining whether two fingerprints were identical. Sergeant Worboys stated that he used fingerprint comparison software that enabled him to put two impressions side by side on a computer screen. He agreed that whether there is sufficient correspondence depends on a number of factors which he identified or agreed was the “clarity” of the impressions, the number of similarities between impressions and the degree to which the differences can be accounted for or explained. He stated that he did not take into account the degree of frequency of any particular characteristics of fingerprints in the human population.
	
	
	In relation to the number of similarities between the two fingerprints, Sergeant Worboys was asked:
	


“Q. Are there any factors that you take into account to determine this question of whether you’ve got enough to make a match?

A. No when I sit down and look at the two impressions side by side it’s when I feel that there is nothing unexplainable that would definitely put the two impressions as a match.

Q. Would you identify a person based on four points of similarity?

A. I can’t speculate on that because I don’t know what those four points are and what the impression is.”


	
	Fourth, Sergeant Worboys was also asked questions about what his examination of JP’s fingerprints and the latent print, ie W3, revealed. He accepted that the latent print was incomplete as there was a missing right “delta” and a left delta and some part of the print overlapped with the gold leaf design on the china jewellery box that it was lifted from. He estimated that possibly less than ten per cent of the print was missing. In re-examination, Sergeant Worboys explained that there was “very sufficient” detail in the latent print to make the comparison with the known print. He also stated that if there was insufficient detail in either print, the print would either not be identified, or would fall into the category of “ridge detail consistent” in which there is insufficient detail in an impression to form an opinion of identification.
	
	
	Further Sergeant Worboys accepted that there were similarities and differences between the prints. Thus he was taken to the photographic impressions of JP’s fingerprint and the latent print. He agreed that the impressions were not identical and not the same shape but said that there were “nil unexplainable differences” between the two prints. In relation to similarities he could not state how many explainable differences he observed and stated that he made no record of the number of similarities he observed (“don’t particularly count when I’m doing my evaluation”). In re-examination he stated that “[o]n the comparison of this the two impressions side by side I examined in excess of 35 characteristic points”.
	
	
	After Sergeant Worboys completed his oral evidence, the prosecution closed its case. There was no case for JP. Instead his Counsel addressed and attacked the reliability of Sergeant Worboys’ evidence in circumstances where, unless it was accepted, the prosecution inevitably failed. Various matters were raised some of which included the matters noted above and, in particular, included the submission that there was “no evidence about what similarities were detected [by Sergeant Worboys] nor explanations [proffered for the] differences detected”. It was, inter alia, contended that the Court should not accept the “ipse dixit” (ie dogmatic and unproven statement) of an expert.
	


His Honour’s judgment


	
	His Honour commenced his judgment by noting that he accepted the contention that it was only the fingerprint evidence that was capable of identifying JP “as being the person involved”. His Honour accepted that fingerprint evidence was “not infallible”. After noting various matters that were raised about the reliability of fingerprint evidence generally and Sergeant Worboys’ evidence in particular His Honour stated:
	


“In this matter I have oral and written evidence from Sergeant Worboys. His evidence was unshaken on his view as to the matching of the thumbprint of [JP]. In my view I disagree with the submissions in this matter, he has given sufficient evidence in these proceedings as to how he reached that determination. As an expert his expertise was not shaken, his opinion was not shaken. He is tasked, as he said, purely to compare W3 to [JP’s] prints. There is clearly in terms of the procedures involved, checks and balances in place. He acknowledged he is aware of case studies where potential impacts and bias of proceedings have occurred. His view as the expert in the field or presented as the expert in this matter is that where the appropriate procedures have taken place, is unlikely to have those errors occur. He also conceded that he had not read a lot of the literature referred to by Ms Graham in the cross-examination. Again he maintained his view that if protocol was followed properly it should not involve bias or incorrect assessment.

The difficulty of course with a lot of material that was cross-examined on is there is no method, no chance to actually test the validity of those arguments.

…

I have no evidence before this Court of the method used in this instance by Sergeant Worboys … [not transcribable] … helping assist in his determination was tainted by the bias or other incorrect assessment by not following the protocols. I have no expert evidence on the defence showing in this particular matter that the thumbprint is not or could not be the accused’s. I say that of course there remains at all times the prosecutions responsibility to prove the matter beyond reasonable doubt. It was suggested that Sergeant Worboys was contradictory or failed to make proper concessions, I actually find to the contrary. He answered appropriately in all circumstances especially where the questions were extremely open-ended and hypothetical. He did not attempt in any way to make his evidence or his position any greater than what it should in terms of the protocols that were involved.

It is put to the Court that the judicial officer could not assess the prints from the photos that are presented. It is not this Court’s role to be the expert, that is why the police call an expert to give their opinion and why, if required the defence call an expert as to why it is not, it is not the Court’s role to look at the various rigors and make a determination and even Sergeant Worboys on his own evidence indicated he needed specialist equipment to be able to identify it.

The evidence by Sergeant Worboys in giving his opinion in determination has not been proved forensically challenged in this matter. There is no Court decisions making such material unacceptable. What has been raised and I accept is that perhaps it is unreliable. The only Court case I have is the Utah court case which has been provided in the final submissions by the defence although I do note that Judge Thorne views and comments on the unreliability or otherwise of fingerprints which as I have already said, I accept in general. In that particular matter it does not appear that the evidence that was provided there forensically or otherwise found the accused not guilty in his comments. At best I have nothing else binding before me that would exclude the evidence of Sergeant Worboys. I can only scrutinise it on the material before me specific to this case. I accept Sergeant Worboys’ evidence in that regard.” (emphasis added)


	
	Having accepted Sergeant Worboys’ evidence that the fingerprints were identical, his Honour then reasoned that it was improbable that another person with the same “thumbprint is in the Dubbo area”. In the absence of any evidence for an innocent explanation for how the presence of JP’s fingerprint “came to be on the jewellery case” his Honour concluded that “there is no reasonable doubt in this matter”.
	


Expert evidence and fingerprints


	
	As much of this appeal was directed to the admissibility of Sergeant Worboys’ opinion that the two fingerprints were identical it is appropriate to address some of the principles concerning the admissibility of expert evidence concerning fingerprints.
	
	
	The statement of Sergeant Worboys that the fingerprints were identical was clearly opinion evidence that was excluded by s 76(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 unless it fell within the relevant exception for expert opinions, namely s 79(1). Subsection 79(1) specifies two conditions of admissibility, firstly that the witness must have “specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience” and, secondly, the opinion must be “wholly or substantially based on that knowledge” (Honeysett v The Queen [2014] HCA 29; 253 CLR 122 at [22]; “Honeysett”). The first condition directs attention to the existence of an area of “specialised knowledge” possessed by the proposed expert witness. At no stage in the Children’s Court or in this Court was it contended that fingerprint analysis was not a relevant area of expertise, or that Sergeant Worboys was not suitability qualified to undertake a fingerprint analysis and express an opinion that two fingerprints were identical.
	
	
	The second condition of admissibility is that the relevant opinion must be ""wholly or substantially based on that [specialised] knowledge"" (Honeysett at [23]). In Honeysett the High Court observed that (at [24])
	


“The second condition of admissibility under s 79(1) allows that it will sometimes be difficult to separate from the body of specialised knowledge on which the expert's opinion depends ‘observations and knowledge of everyday affairs and events’ (…). It is sufficient that the opinion is substantially based on specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience. It must be presented in a way that makes it possible for a court to determine that it is so based (…).”


	
	Whether this condition was met was at the heart of the dispute in Honeysett. An expert in anatomy gave evidence concerning the physical characteristics of an offender as depicted on closed circuit television and the physical characteristics of the accused, and then opined as to the absence of any observable anatomical dissimilarity between the two (Honeysett at [29]). While the High Court accepted that he had specialised knowledge of anatomy, the Court did not accept that the opinions he expressed were substantially based on that specialised knowledge. Instead they were found to only be based on the expert’s “subjective impression of what he saw when he looked at the images” of the offender and the accused (Honeysett at [43]).
	
	
	The essence of the complaint about the decision of the presiding Magistrate to admit Sergeant Worboys’ evidence concerned the absence of any explanation for how the methodology that was applied as explained in [7] of the certificate led to the conclusions in [8] and [9] of that certificate (see [10]). In the last sentence of the extract from Honeysett set out in [27] the High Court referred to the need for an opinion to be “presented” in a manner that allows the Court to be satisfied that the relevant opinion expressed by the expert is substantially based on their specialised knowledge. In so stating the Court relied on the observation of Gleeson CJ in HG v The Queen [1999] HCA 2; 197 CLR 414 at [39], that “[b]y directing attention to whether an opinion is wholly or substantially based on specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience, [s 79] requires that the opinion is presented in a form which makes it possible to answer that question”.
	
	
	In the much cited passage from the judgment of Heydon JA in Makita  his Honour cited Gleeson CJ in HG v The Queen and enunciated a series of preconditions to the admissibility of expert evidence that included (at [85]):
	


“… that is, the expert's evidence must explain how the field of ‘specialised knowledge’ in which the witness is expert by reason of ‘training, study or experience’, and on which the opinion is ‘wholly or substantially based’, applies to the facts assumed or observed so as to produce the opinion propounded. If all these matters are not made explicit, it is not possible to be sure whether the opinion is based wholly or substantially on the expert's specialised knowledge. If the court cannot be sure of that, the evidence is strictly speaking not admissible, and, so far as it is admissible, of diminished weight.” (emphasis added)


	
	To similar but not so prescriptive effect in Ocean Marine Mutual Insurance Association (Europe) OV v Jetopay Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1463; 120 FCR 146 at [23], the Full Court of the Federal Court stated that “exposure of the reasoning process” is required so as to demonstrate “that the opinion is based on … specialised knowledge”.
	
	
	The above passage from Makita does not represent a complete statement of the applicable law on this topic. In Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; 243 CLR 588 at [37] (“Dasreef”) the plurality stated:
	


“The admissibility of opinion evidence is to be determined by application of the requirements of the Evidence Act rather than by any attempt to parse and analyse particular statements in decided cases divorced from the context in which those statements were made. Accepting that to be so, it remains useful to record that it is ordinarily the case, as Heydon JA said in Makita … , that ‘the expert's evidence must explain how the field of 'specialised knowledge' in which the witness is expert by reason of 'training, study or experience', and on which the opinion is 'wholly or substantially based', applies to the facts assumed or observed so as to produce the opinion propounded’. The way in which s 79(1) is drafted necessarily makes the description of these requirements very long. But that is not to say that the requirements cannot be met in many, perhaps most, cases very quickly and easily. That a specialist medical practitioner expressing a diagnostic opinion in his or her relevant field of specialisation is applying ‘specialised knowledge’ based on his or her ‘training, study or experience’, being an opinion ‘wholly or substantially based’ on that ‘specialised knowledge’, will require little explicit articulation or amplification once the witness has described his or her qualifications and experience, and has identified the subject matter about which the opinion is proffered.” (emphasis added)


	
	The emphasised portion of the above passage represents a relaxation of what might be taken to be the strict requirement of Makita that “all of these matters” be “explicit” including how the methodology of the expert “applie[d] to the facts assumed or observed … produce[s] the opinion propounded” (see [30]). In some cases the second condition of admissibility may be satisfied by simply undertaking a comparison of the opinion expressed and the nature of the expertise in question; i.e. that which Makita appeared to state must always be explicit may in some cases be implicit or at the very least require “little explicit articulation or amplification”. Whether that is so will depend on the area of expertise and the nature of the opinion that is expressed (see Hannes v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (No 2) [2006] NSWCCA 373; 205 FLR 217 at [292]). Thus, as the above passage from Dasreef suggests, the familiarity of courts with expressions of medical opinion by suitably qualified medical practitioners enables Courts to draw the conclusion that the second condition of admissibility is met when they state an opinion on a topic within their area of expertise. Ultimately the test is that posed by the statute, namely whether the Court is satisfied that the relevant opinion is wholly or substantially based on the relevant specialised knowledge
	
	
	The extent of the reasoning that a fingerprint expert must disclose to make their opinion admissible has been the subject of discussion in various cases. In R v Hien Puoc Tang [2006] NSWCCA 167; 65 NSWLR 681 (“Tang”) fingerprint evidence was contrasted with an area of expertise that the Courts were not familiar with, namely body mapping. Tang was similar to Honeysett in that the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld a complaint that evidence from an expert in body mapping to identify the appellant was inadmissible. Unlike Honeysett the expert had not just confined himself to giving evidence of an absence of anatomical dissimilarity, but instead purported to state that the anatomical features of the suspect and the accused were such that it could be concluded that they were the same person. Spigelman CJ (with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed) held at [134] that it is a requirement of admissibility that “the opinion be demonstrated to be based on the specialised knowledge. His Honour did not accept that a body mapping expert could give evidence of anatomical similarity (at [140]) but even if they could, his Honour also did not accept that it had been demonstrated how a conclusion about “the identity of the suspect and the offender” could be based on evidence of similarity (at [146]).
	
	
	The plaintiff’s written submissions sought to rely on Tang and another decision, Murdoch v The Queen [2007] NTCCA 1; 167 A Crim R 329, which rejected evidence of facial or body mapping, as support for a proposition that the process of observing similarities in fingerprints was not truly the application of a relevant form of specialised knowledge. However the distinction between such evidence and fingerprint evidence was explained by Spigelman CJ in Tang at [144] as follows:
	


“Facial mapping and, perhaps, body mapping, about the validity of the latter of which virtually nothing appears on the evidence in this case, has a certain resemblance to fingerprint evidence. By long usage, expert evidence is given in the form of an opinion that the fingerprint of the accused is the same as that from the crime scene. Such an opinion is based on the cumulative effect of a number of points of similarity, each of which is itself an expression of opinion.”


	
	In Bennett v Police [2005] SASC 167 (“Bennett”) Doyle CJ dismissed an appeal against a conviction for trespass which was based on expert evidence to the effect that the accused’s fingerprint was found on a computer monitor at the scene. In his evidence in chief the witness had described how a comparison of fingerprints was made, how he compared images of the two prints, and that the two fingerprints were identical and came from the same person (at [6]). In cross-examination he stated that during a lunch break during the hearing he had looked at the images of the fingerprints and identified that “more than 20 characteristics … were common and identical” (at [11]). He did not identify each feature separately and did not describe the appearance of each such feature (at [31]). At the close of the prosecution case an application to exclude the evidence on the basis that the Court could not make any assessment of the points of similarity between the relevant prints was rejected (at [15] to [16]).
	
	
	On appeal, Doyle CJ characterised the three complaints that were made on appeal about the admission of the fingerprint evidence as follows (at [33]):
	


“First, because the image [of the appellant’s print] was not tendered. Second, because the features observed by Mr Lewis and relied on by him were described compendiously, and not individually, and without pointing them out on [the image of the latent print and the appellant’s print]. Third, because the expert opinion was given in a form that did not enable the Magistrate, as the trier of the facts, to decide for himself whether the facts on which the opinion was based, the presence of the features in the images, were in fact to be found in the two images. The submissions to me were put mainly in relation to the third obstacle.”


	
	Doyle CJ rejected each of these contentions. His Honour found that the failure to tender the image of the fingerprints and identify the similarities went only to the weight to be attached to the evidence not the admissibility (at [47] to [49]). In particular his Honour stated (at [49]):
	


“The fact of the presence of features on which the expert relied is proved by the expert giving evidence that the expert looked at the images and saw the features. It was permissible to say that identical features were found, without itemising them …” (emphasis added)


	
	In relation to the third contention, his Honour stated the authorities do not establish that the only way in which a fingerprint expert’s opinion that two prints are identical could be established is by “repeat[ing] and illustrat[ing] for the court the process that he went through when comparing the images of the two fingerprints …” but that instead it was sufficient that (at [52]):
	


“… the expert informed the court about the facts upon which his expert opinion was based. The facts were the making of the comparison of the two images … and the observation by the expert of features in each image that the expert considered to be identical and of significance for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to the two prints being identical.”


	
	His Honour referred to the above passage from Makita and the decisions in R v O’Callaghan [1976] VR 676 and R v Lawless [1974] VR 398 which emphasise that ultimately it is for the jury to determine whether two fingerprints are identical before stating (at [53]):
	


“However, it is one thing to acknowledge that it was for the Magistrate to decide in the present case whether the two fingerprints were identical. It is another thing to say that the Magistrate could so decide only if the evidence as to the findings on examination of the two images was given in the detail that [Counsel for the applicant] said was required. The Magistrate had before him unchallenged evidence that each fingerprint exhibited features that, taken together, led to the conclusion that they were identical.”


	
	On further appeal the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia agreed with Doyle CJ (Bennett v Police [2005] SASC 415 especially at [31] to [33] per Anderson J). Perry ACJ stated (at [4] to [6]):
	


“Identification of similarities in fingerprints is a highly technical matter requiring considerable expertise and experience. I have regularly instructed juries not to attempt to make such a comparison themselves.

This does not mean that the jury must necessarily accept expert opinion on the matter. For example, they may find the evidence unconvincing; they may have doubts as to the independence or qualifications of the expert; they may not be satisfied that there are sufficient points of similarity; there may be a conflict of expert evidence; they may suspect police tampering with the evidence.

At the end of the day, it is for the jury to determine whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the accuracy and reliability of the expert evidence.” (emphasis added)


	
	Neither the judgment of Doyle CJ in Bennett or of the Full Court appeal from Doyle CJ suggest that a mere assertion that a methodology was applied and the outcome was a conclusion that the fingerprints were identical satisfied the second condition of admissibility in s 79; i.e. a bare assertion that two fingerprints are the same will not suffice. Instead both judgments proceed on the basis that some explanation or statement of what the examination revealed at a level of detail below a conclusion that the fingerprints were identical must be provided for the evidence to be admissible, albeit not much. Thus in Bennett all that was stated about the application of the methodology of comparing fingerprints was that 20 characteristics were observed and found to be identical. The above passage from the judgment of Perry ACJ assumed that a jury is informed about the number of points of similarity between the relevant fingerprints.
	
	
	Although the judgments in Bennett treated a statement of what an examination of the fingerprints revealed as a statement of the facts on which an opinion was based as opposed to part of the explanation for why the application of the relevant methodology led to the relevant opinion, the difference, if any, is presently immaterial. In the end result the judgments in Bennett are an example of the approach stated in the emphasised portion of the passage from Dasreef noted above at [32], namely that with fingerprint evidence it will often be the case that “little explicit articulation or amplification” of how the stated methodology warrants the conclusion that two fingerprints are identical will be required before it can be concluded that the second condition of admissibility under s 79(1) has been satisfied.
	


Nature of the appeal


	
	In view of the manner in which a number of the grounds of appeal are expressed it is necessary to make a few observations about the scheme for appeals provided for by Division 1 of Part 5 of the Review Act. Division 1 of Part 5 deals with appeals to this Court by a person convicted or sentenced by the Local Court otherwise than for an “environmental offence”. As noted, s 52(1) confers on such a person a right of appeal “but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone”.
	
	
	Section 53(1) expands the scope of this appeal. It provides:
	


“(1) Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court, otherwise than with respect to an environmental offence, may appeal to the Supreme Court against the conviction or sentence on a ground that involves:

(a) a question of fact, or

(b) a question of mixed law and fact,

but only by leave of the Supreme Court.”


	
	Sub-section 54(1) confers on the Court power to grant or dismiss an application for leave to appeal. If leave is granted then the Court may adjourn the appeal or proceed to hear it (s 54(4)). Subsection 55(1) confers on the Court a power to set the conviction aside, set the conviction aside and remit the matter to the Local Court or dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	I addressed the scope of an appeal that is restricted to a question of law alone in the context of s 56 of the Review Act in Bimson, Roads & Maritime Services v Damorange Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 734 at [39] to [46]. That passage should be read together with this judgment. It suffices to state that “… there is 'a question of law alone' if the question of law can be stated and considered separately from the facts with which it may be connected in a given case” (Williams v R [1986] HCA 88; 161 CLR 278 at 287 per Gibbs CJ and 314 per Wilson and Dawson JJ; “Williams”). Further an appeal on a ground that involves a question of law alone does not include a ground that involves a mixed question of fact and law (R v PL [2009] NSWCCA 256 at [25] per Spigelman J (“PL (No 1)”) and thus a mere complaint of error in the application of a legal principle does not raise a question of law alone (PL (No 1) at [26]). Nevertheless a conclusion of mixed fact and law can be challenged in an appeal restricted to questions of law alone if it can be determined that the conclusion “proceed[ed] from a misdirection of law” (Williams at p 287 per Gibbs CJ). To similar effect in PL (No 1) at [27] Spigelman CJ stated that a contention that the presiding judicial officer erred may involve a question of law alone if a stand alone legal proposition can be identified which was a “distinct and separate step in the reasoning process” (Pl (No 1) at [27]).
	
	
	In relation to s 53(1) there appears to have been little judicial consideration to the circumstances in which leave to raise a ground that involves a question of fact or of mixed law and fact may be granted save for the following observations of Howie J in Kapral v Bunting [2009] NSWSC 749 at [48]:
	


“The parties were not able to refer me to any decision that has considered the grant of leave under the relevant provisions of the Appeal Act in respect of a matter involving a question of mixed fact and law or a question of fact. I have some difficulty in conceiving of a case where leave might be granted on a question of fact. But it should be noted that the particular provision, s 53(1) of the Appeal Act, is actually concerned with appeals against conviction or sentence. It is perhaps possible to imagine that there may in such an appeal be an error of fact of such significance that it might, if not reviewed, result in a positive injustice. It is difficult to see such a situation arising from an appeal against an order of the kind made by the Magistrate in the present case. The Supreme Court should in my opinion be cautious before interfering with a factual decision made by a magistrate who correctly understood and applied the law in an otherwise unimpeachable hearing in the Local Court and where minds might reasonably differ about the finding of fact involved.”


	
	To these observations I would add that Part 3 of the Review Act, and ss 11(1) and 18(1) of the Review Act in particular, confer on persons convicted in the Local Court a form of appeal to the District Court as of right that extends to matters of fact (see AG v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2015] NSWCA 218). The structure of the Review Act is such that that form of appeal is the primary means by which matters of fact said to affect a conviction are to be agitated. Perhaps one circumstance in which a grant of leave under s 53(1) might be considered is where the question of law and fact or just fact sought to be raised relates to a question of law that is raised bona fide in the appeal and there is an understandable desire to avoid a bifocation of proceedings by requiring the convicted person to pursue complaints about issues of mixed fact and law or fact in a separate appeal to the District Court under Part 3. That said a grant of leave with respect to a pure question of fact can be expected to be a comparatively rare event and when exercised conditions may attach to its grant.
	


Grounds 1 and 6: The admissibility of Sergeant Worboys’ evidence


	
	Ground 1 of JP’s appeal contends that Sergeant Worboys’ certificate was not capable of amounting to an admissible expert opinion. Ground 6 contends that the presiding Magistrate erred in admitting the opinion evidence of Sergeant Worboys. It is accepted that ground 6 does not raise a question of law alone but involves a mixed question of law and fact. Accordingly leave to raise that ground is sought.
	
	
	It also follows from the observations in [47] that ground 1 does not involve a question of law alone either. The ground does not identify a question of law independent of the facts and circumstances of JP’s case (Williams). In possible recognition of this, the written submissions in support of ground 1 sought to identify the question of law alone raised by the admission of Sergeant Worboys’ report as follows:
	


“Whether a statement of expert evidence which includes methodology and conclusion but no description of a) the findings on application of the methodology, b) assumptions of fact, or c) reasoning process from findings and assumptions to the conclusion, is capable of amounting to admissible expert evidence.”


	
	To the extent that this question refers to assumptions of fact the only relevant assumption that is said to be missing from Sergeant Worboys’ certificate is his assumption that no two persons have the same fingerprint. This appears to be strongly suspected to be true but incapable of definitive proof. That omission is irrelevant to the admissibility of the report in that the relevant opinion was treated by the presiding magistrate as only being a statement to the effect that the two fingerprints were identical. His Honour reasoned for himself as to whether that fact suggested that it was JP’s fingerprint (see [24]).
	
	
	Otherwise the difficulty for JP with the above formulation of the question of law alone is that it follows from the emphasised portion of the extract from Dasreef in [32] above that the answer to this question is “maybe”. In some circumstances, such as those involving a specialist medical practitioner, giving a diagnostic opinion on a straightforward medical matter, “little explicit articulation or amplification” is required to fulfil the second condition of admissibility. With some opinions at least matters of fact and degree or evaluation are involved. Unless there was only one answer to a question that involves such matters then no question of law alone is raised (Landsman v R [2014] NSWCCA 328; 88 NSWLR 534 at [43] to [44] per Beazley P).
	
	
	I have set out the brief ex tempore reasons of his Honour for admitting the certificate in [12] above. I respectfully disagree with his Honour’s conclusion that Sergeant Worboys “set out what his actual comparisons are” and “it’s there” in the sense explained. While in [7] of the certificate Sergeant Worboys set out the methodology that was applied in examining the fingerprints, nowhere in the certificate was there any statement of what that examination revealed. Instead there was simply a statement of the ultimate opinion formed as a result of that opinion (in [8] and [9]). This can be contrasted with Bennett in which there was ultimately a statement by the expert of what their examination revealed, albeit a brief one. In this case the opinion in [8] and [9] was insufficiently supported by any reasons (or factual findings on the approach stated in Bennett) for it be admitted into evidence.
	
	
	However His Honour’s reasons for admitting the certificate do not reveal that his Honour acted on any incorrect principle relevant to the admissibility of expert evidence. Instead his Honour appears to have recognised the need for some description of what the process of comparison revealed but instead misapplied that principle in concluding that it was present. It follows that ground 1 does not involve a question of law alone (PL (No 1) supra).
	
	
	Nevertheless there remains ground 6. In relation to that ground, JP seeks leave to raise a ground involving a mixed question of law and fact. The circumstance that Sergeant Worboys’ ultimate conclusion that the latent print and JP’s print were identical was critical to JP’s conviction and the absence of any statement in the certificate that explained any aspect of the outcome of his application of that methodology or how that led to his ultimate conclusion together with the close connection between this point and ground 1 warrants a grant of leave. For the reasons already stated in my view the admission of the certificate was erroneous. However it is a condition of leave that the admissibility of Sergeant Worboys’ ultimate opinion be assessed by considering the entirety of his oral evidence and not just the certificate which was tendered in chief. Had the certificate been rejected on the basis that it did not disclose how the methodology that was applied led to Sergeant Worboys’ ultimate conclusion then it would have been open to the prosecution to lead oral evidence that remedied the deficiency. There is no reason why the prosecution should be disadvantaged on appeal by denying it the capacity to rely on Sergeant Worboys’ oral evidence.
	
	
	I have described Sergeant Worboys’ oral evidence at [14] to [21]. Relevantly he supplemented his report by stating that he examined 35 characteristic points using software that placed the latent print and JP’s fingerprint side by side, and that he did not record the number of similarities but nevertheless concluded that each such point was either similar or the difference was explainable. In one part of the written submissions filed in support of the appeal complaint is made that the eliciting in re-examination of evidence that 35 characteristics points were examined was unfair. This complaint was not tethered to any ground of appeal and in any event has no substance. The entitlement to ask the question arose from the cross-examination especially that part summarised in [18] to [21] and the question was not objected to. If any relevant unfairness in the eliciting of the answer in re-examination had been identified before the presiding Magistrate then it would have been open to his Honour to allow further cross-examination to address it. No unfairness was complained of much less identified.
	
	
	Is the description of what Sergeant Worboys’ examination of the fingerprints revealed that was given in his oral evidence sufficient to render his opinion that the prints were identical admissible? In my view it follows from the discussion in [25] to [43] that it was just sufficient. The judgments in Bennett and the observations of Spigelman CJ in Tang at [144] indicate that “little explicit articulation or amplification” of the outcome of the application of the methodology is required to satisfy the second condition of admissibility of an opinion about the correspondence between two fingerprints (Dasreef at [37]).
	
	
	The lengthy written submissions in support of this ground identify two principal matters as negating a conclusion that Sergeant Worboys’ evidence was admissible even having regard to his oral evidence. The first is summarised in the written submissions as follows:
	


“The Plaintiff however submits that in the circumstances of this case where:

the relevant print was incomplete, and there was no suggestion that the witness could predict what was 'missing',

he ultimately accepted it was not possible to rely on the absolute uniqueness of human fingerprints,

he did not engage in analysis of level 3 detail,

the distinction between what is actually different and what was able to be observed by him as different was said to be beyond his expertise, and

he claimed that he did not take into account in any way the rarity or frequency of the similarities observed,

the demonstration of connection between specialised knowledge and evidence of identification was not made out.”


	
	The first to third and fifth of these points have already been explained. The fourth point is a reference to a passage in the cross-examination of Sergeant Worboys where his Honour upheld an objection to a question that asked him to distinguish between what is different “in fact and what is able to be seen as different”. Whether his Honour was correct to uphold that objection or not is immaterial, although I have sympathy for the proposition that Sergeant Worboys’ views on metaphysics were irrelevant. It suffices to state that none of the above points have any bearing on the admissibility of Sergeant Worboys' opinion. At most they only bear upon its weight. As already stated the assumption that no two fingerprints could be identical was ultimately immaterial. Otherwise, as I will explain, the materiality of these alleged limitations and omissions to his ultimate opinion was not accepted by Sergeant Worboys or proven by any other witness or evidentiary material. An opinion which is supported by an asserted path of reasoning that meets the statutory test is not rendered inadmissible by demonstrating that the actual reasoning of the expert involved further steps and assumptions (ASIC v Rich & Ors [2005] NSWCA 152; 54 ACSR 326), and nor is it rendered inadmissible by merely pointing to some other steps that the expert could have taken but did not.
	
	
	Second, the plaintiff’s written submissions on this ground contend that Sergeant Worboys’ evidence did not specify or provide the necessary scientific criteria for its accuracy to be tested. In one part of the submissions it is suggested that this could have been done by tendering “comparison charts” as occurs in the District Court or Supreme Court. Failing that the submissions contend:
	


“Even without a chart, a basic description of what was found on examination was imperative. It is completely unclear why the report did not say, for example, that the witness found a certain nominated number of points of similarity, general description of what they were and why they were significant, and nominate the number of apparent differences with articulation of why they were explicable.”


	
	It follows from the above discussion, especially the judgments in Bennett, that none of these matters were required to be provided to render Sergeant Worboys’ opinion admissible. Only a relatively brief statement of what the examination revealed was necessary. It may be that in a particular case the inability or refusal of the prosecution to respond to a timely request to provide material of this kind might warrant a discretionary exclusion of such evidence under s 135 of the Evidence Act. However no such application was made in this case. In that regard reference was made to that provision and s 137 during oral submissions on this appeal. However, in the absence of those provisions being invoked at first instance it is difficult to see how any question of law alone is raised by his Honour’s refusal to consider their application. Further, leave to raise a question of mixed law and fact concerning s 135 and s 137 of the Evidence Act should not be granted since those provisions were not sought to be invoked at first instance.
	
	
	I grant leave to raise ground 6 as pleaded but dismiss the ground. I refuse leave to raise a ground involving a question of mixed error of fact and law concerning the application of ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act.
	


Ground 2: Reasons for admission of Sergeant Worboys’ Certificate


	
	Ground 2 of the appeal contends that his Honour failed to provide adequate reasons for the admission of the report of Sergeant Worboys.
	
	
	The submissions in support of this ground contend that a “failure to provide reasons involves error in a question of law alone”. A failure to provide adequate reasons can constitute an error of law (Campbelltown City Council v Vegan [2006] NSWCA 284; 67 NSWLR 372 at [131]). A complaint that a judicial officer did not provide adequate reasons could involve a question of law alone if a question is posed in terms that are unrelated to the circumstances of the particular case, but pose a question as to the content of that obligation of the officer to address a particular matter. A complaint of this kind was upheld in Shepherd v Nestoriadis [2015] NSWSC 348. However, as discussed below in [72], if the complaint concerns a matter of fact then on an appeal restricted to a question of law the obligation to provide reasons is of very limited content (Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 281-282; “Soulemezis”).
	
	
	It is not necessary to consider this further because if I considered this complaint had sufficient substance but did not involve a question of law alone, then I would grant leave under s 53(1)(b) of the Review Act. However I do not consider that it has any substance. The reasons that his Honour gave for admitting the report are set out in [12]. The extempore delivery of brief reasons for the admission of experts’ reports is completely unremarkable and usually only the briefest of reasons, if any, are required (Evans v Powell [2012] NSWSC 1384 at [16]) . The brief complaint in the written submissions was that the reasons do not “adequately explain the reason to admit the [report] in light of the objection taken” (at [61]). The objection taken was the absence of any reasoning in the certificate between the statement of methodology and the conclusion. His Honour addressed that objection and rejected it. I respectfully consider that his Honour was wrong to do so, but that conclusion is irrelevant to a complaint about the adequacy of reasons.
	
	
	I reject ground 2 of the appeal. To the extent that leave is sought to raise it, I refuse leave.
	


Ground 3: Different standard for the admission of evidence in the Children’s Court?


	
	Ground 3 of the appeal contends that his Honour erred in applying a “less demanding standard for admissibility of expert opinion … in the Children’s Court as compared to the District Court or Supreme Court”. Reformulated, this ground does raise a question of law alone, namely whether there is such a less demanding standard? The answer to that question is “no” (see Evidence Act 1995, s 4(1)).
	
	
	However the question does not arise in these proceedings. The premise of this ground is that in deciding to admit Sergeant Worboys’ report and stating that the report “barely makes it but in my view for these proceedings it’s sufficient” (see [12]) his Honour was positing the existence of some different and perhaps lower standard for the admission of expert evidence in the Children’s Court compared to other courts. I do not accept that premise. His Honour’s reference to the report “barely mak[ing] it” was simply a reference to the question of admissibility not being easy to resolve. Otherwise I am not satisfied that the reference to “these proceedings” is to be taken to be a reference to “this class of proceedings”, namely proceedings in the Children’s Court as opposed to a reference to the particular charge being heard and determined by his Honour.
	
	
	I reject ground 3.
	


Ground 4: Adequacy of reasons for finding JP guilty


	
	Ground 4 of the appeal contends that his Honour failed to provide adequate reasons for being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the latent fingerprint was deposited by the plaintiff.
	
	
	The discussion in [65] applies equally at this point but further elaboration as to the effect of Soulemezis in this context is required. In Wise v Schneider [2015] NSWSC 725 at [46] to [47] I stated:
	


“[46]   … Where the subject matter of the appeal is restricted to a question of law alone, the power of the appellate court to intervene to set aside the decision of the lower court based on a finding of fact for which supposedly inadequate reasons have been provided is governed by the principles enunciated by McHugh JA in Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 281–282 (see Valuer-General v Perilya Broken Hill Ltd [2013] NSWCA 265 at [92]). In particular, in Soulemezis at 281 McHugh JA stated:

‘In a case where a right of appeal is given only in respect of a question of law, different considerations apply from the case where there is a full appeal. An ultimate finding of fact, which is not subject to appeal and which is in no way dependent upon the application of a legal standard, can be treated less elaborately than an issue involving a question of law or mixed fact and law. If no right of appeal is given against findings of fact, a failure to state the basis of even a crucial finding of fact, if it involves no legal standard, will only constitute an error of law if the failure can be characterised as a breach of the principle that justice must be seen to be done. If, for example, the only issue before a court is whether the plaintiff sustained injury by falling over, a simple finding that he fell or sustained injury would be enough, if the decision turns simply on the plaintiff’s credibility. But if, in addition to the issue of credibility, other matters were relied on as going to the probability or improbability of the plaintiff’s case, such a simple finding would not be enough.’ (emphasis added)

[47]   Thus in Soulemezis in rejecting a challenge to a finding of fact that was said to be perverse, McHugh JA stated at p 282:

‘It is not to the point that his Honour’s finding was erroneous or as counsel for the applicant claimed, perverse. An erroneous or perverse finding of fact raises no question of law and cannot be challenged by way of appeal. What is decisive is that his Honour’s judgment reveals the ground for, although not the detailed reasoning in support of, his finding of fact. But that is enough in a case where no appeal lies against the finding of fact. Accordingly there was no failure to give reasons sufficient to constitute an error of law.’” (emphasis added)


	
	As with ground 2, if I considered this complaint had sufficient substance but did not involve a question of law alone, then I would grant leave to raise it under s 53(1)(b) of the Review Act. However I do not consider that it has substance.
	
	
	The relevant parts of his Honour’s judgment finding JP guilty are set out above. They are to be considered in light of the fact that the only real factual issue in dispute was whether it was JP’s fingerprint that was found at the scene. The resolution of that factual dispute adverse to JP led almost inexorably to the finding of guilt (see [24]). JP’s complaints on appeal do not concern this latter aspect of his Honour’s reasoning but instead the finding of fact that the prints were identical. Hence the above principles from Soulemezis are engaged by this complaint.
	
	
	In the first part of his Honour’s reasons for convicting JP set out in [23] his Honour recorded his view that Sergeant Worboys’ evidence was “not shaken”, that he had given “sufficient evidence” to explain how he reached his opinion and summarised Sergeant Worboys’ response to the various points that were raised. In the third paragraph his Honour considered and rejected the attacks made on Sergeant Worboys’ demeanour in answering questions. His Honour’s reasons more than satisfied Soulemezis. His Honour clearly stated “the ground for … his finding of fact”.
	
	
	Nevertheless, out of deference to the matters argued, I will address the principal complaints about his Honour’s reasons. The submissions before the presiding Magistrate and in this Court were replete with references to the various points that were made during the course of the cross-examination of Sergeant Worboys. Some of those are summarised above at [18] to [19], but they also include the absence of any evidence that Sergeant Worboys’ evidence had been verified by another expert, Sergeant Worboys’ disclaimer of any bias, his rejection of the possibility that he was wrong, his failure to read the learning guide referred to at [16] and his lack of knowledge of an inquiry into fingerprint analysis undertaken by Lord Campbell in the United Kingdom.
	
	
	However these do not address the observation of the presiding Magistrate that not only was there an absence of any competing expert evidence but there was “no chance to test the validity of [the] arguments” that were made about Sergeant Worboys’ evidence. The point being made by his Honour is that there was nothing to indicate that these alleged failings were of any significance. In the end result his Honour was presented with the uncontradicted evidence of an expert whose demeanour and credibility his Honour accepted. The expert addressed and in some respects accepted the criticisms that were made during cross-examination but did not accept that such of those as were accepted affected the reliability of his opinion. As noted by his Honour there was no other evidence to demonstrate that either.
	
	
	The difficulty with the written submissions in support of this ground is exemplified by the following contentions:
	


“79 … Sergeant Worboys' extraordinary hubris on the last day of the hearing regarding his own ability, and the ACE-V method-speaking of it as though it was equivalent to a computer checking a barcode – was irrational, directly at odds with the obviously correct concessions made earlier in the proceedings about the subjective nature of fingerprint comparison and evaluation (where everybody sees something different), and was not capable of doing anything other than undermining his credibility as an expert witness.

80. [Sergeant Worboys’] demonstrated lack of knowledge of important contemporary issues in his field was not capable of doing anything other than undermining the weight of his evidence.”


	
	These contentions make assertions of fact that were not accepted in the proceedings below. His Honour’s findings concerning Sergeant Worboys’ demeanour are completely inconsistent with him having displayed “extraordinary hubris”. The only evidence of the application of the “ACE-V” method was given by Sergeant Worboys and that was not “irrational”. Otherwise Sergeant Worboys did not accept that he lacked knowledge of “important contemporary issues”. That is the author’s assertion. For his Honour to accept that contention he would need to have some evidence that the “issues” being referred to and which Sergeant Worboys did not have knowledge of were both contemporary and important. Overall, these assertions only serve to highlight the point made by his Honour, namely that there was no evidentiary material from which he could conclude that the various criticisms made of Sergeant Worboys were of any real significance to the reliability of his ultimate opinion.
	
	
	Ultimately the written submissions in support of this ground contended as follows:
	


“81.    Ultimately, the only reasons of his Honour’s which are supported by the evidence are that Sergeant Worboys was not shown to have been, in fact, biased; and that no expert evidence was called to show his opinion was wrong. These are plainly inadequate reasons for acceptance beyond reasonable doubt that the plaintiff deposited W3 at the crime scene.

82.    His Honour was not able to give adequate reasons in this matter because adequate material to assess the expert opinion had not been placed before him.”


	
	These submissions do not engage with Soulemezis. A complaint of inadequate reasons is not a vehicle for a complaint concerning the merits of the decision (Wise v Schneider at [42]). Otherwise this contention misstates his Honour’s reasoning process, which I have addressed above. The path of his Honour’s reasons towards a guilty verdict was clear. Whether or not they disclose an adequate basis for a finding of guilty beyond reasonable doubt is a different issue to whether or not they meet the requisite standard.
	
	
	I reject ground 4 of the appeal. To the extent that leave may be necessary to raise it and is sought, it is refused.
	


Grounds 5 and 8: Failure to properly exercise decision making responsibility


	
	Ground 5 contends that in convicting JP “his Honour failed to exercise his decision making responsibility”. This is said to raise a question of law alone. Ground 8 contended that his Honour “divested too much of his Honour’s decision making responsibility to Sergeant Worboys”. Leave to raise ground 8 is sought pursuant to s 53(1) of the Review Act.
	
	
	Each of these grounds is directed towards the following part of his Honour’s reasons for convicting JP:
	


“It is put to the Court that the judicial officer could not assess the prints from the photos that are presented. It is not this Court’s role to be the expert, that is why the police call an expert to give their opinion and why, if required the defence call an expert as to why it is not, it is not the Court’s role to look at the various rigors and make a determination and even Sergeant Worboys on his own evidence indicated he needed specialist equipment to be able to identify it.”


	
	The written submissions in support of these grounds contend that the “central legal question at the core of both grounds is whether it was the responsibility of the expert, or the tribunal of fact (assisted by the expert), to decide whether W3 was deposited by the Plaintiff”.
	
	
	There is no doubt that ground 5 is capable of involving a question of law alone about the respective roles of the tribunal of fact and an expert. However the premise of both grounds 5 and 8 is that a proper reading of his Honour’s reasons reveals that his Honour simply devolved the task of determining whether the latent print was deposited by JP to Sergeant Worboys without determining whether Sergeant Worboys’ evidence should be accepted. However his Honour did not reason that way. As was submitted by Counsel for the Director, Ms Davidson, in the above passage his Honour simply “reasoned that it was not necessary for him to be put in the same position as Sergeant Worboys so that he could perform for himself the comparison exercise in order to determine whether he was satisfied with the expert evidence”. This approach was consistent with authority. In R v Lawless [1974] VR 398 at 423 the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria stated:
	


“It is a matter for expertise not possessed by the ordinary run of mankind to identify characteristics of fingerprints and their patterns in each of two prints and make a comparison and form a conclusion as to whether they are identical or not and the jury could not be invited or allowed to act as experts: see R v Tilley, [1961] 1 WLR 1309; [1961] 3 All ER406; Rv Harden [1963] 1 QB 8; [1962] 1 All ER 286; R v Weise [1969] VR 953, at p. 972. That is not to say of course that the jury could be prevented from examining the exhibits for the purpose of determining whether they were satisfied to the necessary degree by the evidence of the witness. The determination was for them, but the provision of evidence was for the experts.”


	
	This passage was endorsed in R v O’Callaghan [1976] VR 676 at 678 to 679 and is consistent with the observations of Perry ACJ in Bennett set out above (at [41]).
	
	
	I reject ground 5. I grant leave to raise ground 8 but dismiss the ground.
	


Ground 9: Not open to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt


	
	Ground 9 contends that it was not open to his Honour to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the latent fingerprint W3 was deposited by the plaintiff. The written submissions lodged in support of JP’s appeal recognise that this does not involve a question of law alone, but instead leave is sought to raise it as a mixed question of law and fact (or fact alone). The submissions contend that in light of the various complaints that are otherwise made in relation to Sergeant Worboys’ evidence that a “proper application of the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt pointed only to one conclusion in this case” and that a “finding of guilt was unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence”.
	
	
	I do not accept this complaint. In my view the approach taken by the presiding Magistrate to Sergeant Worboys’ evidence was reasonably open to his Honour. While a number of criticisms were made of Sergeant Worboys' evidence it was open to his Honour to conclude that there was no material to indicate that, to the extent the criticisms were sustained, they materially affected the weight to be attached to Sergeant Worboys’ opinion that the fingerprints were identical. Otherwise his Honour had the distinct advantage of being able to observe Sergeant Worboys give evidence and respond to criticism. Once the conclusion was reached that the latent print was identical to JP's fingerprint, then a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt was clearly open.
	
	
	I refuse leave to raise ground 9.
	


Conclusion


	
	Ground 7 was not pressed. Neither party sought costs.
	
	
	Accordingly the Court orders that:
	



	
	To the extent necessary the plaintiff be granted leave to raise grounds 6 and 8 in his summons filed 5 May 2015.
	
	
	The plaintiff's summons be otherwise dismissed.

	HIDDEN J: I agree with Adamson J.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Adamson J.
	
	
	ADAMSON J: The applicant, Kristian Marrow, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him by Christie ADCJ on 8 July 2014. He was sentenced for one count of robbery contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), for which the maximum penalty is fourteen years’ imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period for the offence. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years with a non-parole period of three years and six months commencing on 25 September 2013, being the date on which he was taken into custody following his arrest.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	The grounds of appeal, if leave is granted, are:
	


“1.   The sentencing judge erred in applying only a 20% discount for applicant’s ‘earliest’ possible plea of guilty in the Local Court.

2.   The sentencing judge erred properly [sic] having regard to the applicant’s mental health in a principled fashion and in particular in failing to consider the critical parts of Dr Furst’s reports and by erroneously applying R v Lawrence to the applicant’s case.

3.   The sentence is manifestly excessive.”

The offending conduct


	
	The following narrative is largely taken from the statement of agreed facts tendered by the Crown at the sentence hearing.
	
	
	On Friday 20 September 2013, at about 3.28pm, the offender entered the Picton branch of the Bendigo Bank. He was wearing a black hat, large black sunglasses, a brightly coloured jumper, shorts and work boots. He carried a backpack. He approached one of the tellers and handed her a piece of paper, which was folded, on which the words: ‘GIVE ME THE MONEY” were written.
	
	
	The note also read as follows:
	


*LOOK BUDDY

I DON’T WANT ANY

TROUBLE I HAVE A GUN

IN MY POCKET NOW HAND

OVER ALL THE MONEY OTHERWISE

UR IN TROUBLE OK

PS HAVE A NICE DAY

.   .

V [smiley face]


	
	The teller removed a bundle of $50 notes from her console and handed them to the offender. After the offender left the branch with the money, which totaled $6,750, staff activated the hold-up alarm.
	
	
	Ultimately the offender was identified from the CCTV footage. He was arrested on Wednesday 25 September 2013. On the way to the Narellan Police Station, police asked the offender whether he worked. He responded that he had been fired on Thursday 19 September 2013. When investigators asked why he had been fired, the offender responded: “for stealing the pink slips of the pallets, I then had a brain snap and robbed a bank”.
	
	
	Soon after his arrival at the station, the offender took part in a recorded interview, in the course of which he adopted the statements he had made to police set out above.
	
	
	A search warrant executed by police on the offender’s home led to the discovery of the clothing worn by the offender when he robbed the bank; $2,455 in cash; and a St George Bank deposit slip dated 24 September 2013 recording a deposit of $2,700. A total of $5,155 was recovered: $1,595 remained outstanding.
	
	
	The applicant remained in custody from the time of his arrest on 25 September 2013.
	


The sentence hearing


	
	At the sentence hearing before Christie ADCJ, the Crown tendered documents which included: the agreed statement of facts; the applicant’s criminal histories in New South Wales and Western Australia and his custodial history; the facts relating to the offences in Western Australia; and a victim impact statement of Ms Ross, the bank teller who had served the applicant and handed over the cash in response to his demand.
	
	
	In her victim impact statement Ms Ross described the “profound impact” the offending conduct had had on her and her family. She has become “extremely wary” of others. Although she had worked for the Bendigo Bank since 2011, she has taken up casual employment in “a completely different industry” because of the offence. Her statement concluded:
	


“I will never forget this matter and am quite angry that a stranger can have such a negative impact on my life.”


	
	The criminal history in Western Australia showed that in 2007 the applicant (who was then 25 years old) pleaded guilty to one count of burglary and stealing, which occurred on 7 January 2007; two counts of armed robbery; and two counts of attempted armed robbery, also in January 2007 as a result of which he had been sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of two years and six months which commenced on 28 January 2007. The circumstances of the armed robbery and attempted armed robbery offences are set out below.

			21 Jan 2007, 2.42pm
			
			
			Caltex Service Station, Perth (armed robbery)
			
			
			Applicant wearing sunglasses. Passed note to two males behind the till, which stated that the applicant had a gun and instructed them to hand over money. They handed over $468 to the applicant who departed the scene.
			
		
		
			
			26 Jan 2007, 3.17pm
			
			
			BP Service Station, Ballajura (attempted armed robbery)
			
			
			Applicant wearing sunglasses and baseball cap. Handed note to male attendant which stated the accused was armed with a gun and instructed him to hand over money. The recipient told the accused that there was no money. The accused grabbed the note and left the service station.
			
		
		
			
			26 Jan 2007, 3.38pm
			
			
			Caltex Starmart, Mallaga (armed robbery)
			
			
			Applicant wearing sunglasses and baseball cap. Handed note to male attendant which stated the accused was armed with a gun and instructed him to hand over money. The attendant handed over $580 from the till. The applicant took the note and the money and left.
			
		
		
			
			27 Jan 2007, 9pm
			
			
			Caltex Service Station, North Malaga (attempted armed robbery)
			
			
			Applicant wearing sunglasses. Handed note to male attendant which stated the accused was armed with a gun and instructed him to hand over money. The attendant realised that the applicant was not carrying a gun and pressed the hold-up alarm and locked the doors to the service station remotely. Police attended and arrested the applicant. He was interviewed and made some admissions.
			
		
	



	
	I note for completeness the explanation given by McKechnie J, the sentencing judge in Western Australia, in the remarks on sentence, that the criminal law in that jurisdiction then provided that threats of violence were treated as amounting to being armed. This explains why the applicant’s convictions were for armed robbery and attempted armed robbery, although he was not, in fact, armed.
	
	
	Mr Townsend, who appeared for the applicant at the sentence hearing, tendered two reports from Dr Furst. The first, dated 18 May 2014, was prepared at the request of the applicant’s solicitors. The second, dated 20 June 2014, was prepared after the Crown had provided him with material relating to the offences in Western Australia. Mr Townsend also tendered a copy of the note the applicant had taken into the bank (which is set out in full above).
	
	
	Dr Furst was not required for cross-examination. He diagnosed the applicant as suffering from Schizophrenia (Chronic and treatment resistant); Substance Use Disorder (alcohol abuse); and Pathological Gambling.
	
	
	In his first report, he opined, relevantly:
	


“In my opinion, the offence in question was largely a spontaneous and impulsive act, notwithstanding the hold-up note he wrote in the bank on the back of a deposit slip and ineffective efforts to conceal his identity. He has a history of acting in an impulsive and maladaptive manner when previously psychotic, which was probably the case at the time in question before the court.

In my opinion, his chronic schizophrenic illness prevented him from thinking through the consequences of his actions in a calm manner and/or controlling of his actions; however, his impairment was not so severe as to warrant a mental illness defence in the McNaughton’s sense. His schizophrenic illness mitigates [sic] against the obvious seriousness of his actions.”


	
	He also addressed the effects of a custodial sentence on the applicant as follows:
	


“In my opinion, a custodial sentence is likely to weigh more heavily on Mr Marrow than the average offender by virtue of his chronic mental illness and general vulnerability from other inmates. Prison settings in NSW, even with added mental health support, are harsh and frequently violent environments, which are more difficult for persons with chronic mental is [sic] to negotiate than the average offender.”


	
	In his second report, he confirmed his earlier opinion as follows:
	


“I remain of the opinion that Mr Marrow was suffering from a psychotic episode at the time of the offence.”


	
	Dr Furst addressed the further material provided by the Crown, which included details of the previous offences:
	


“In my opinion, having regard to all of the material from 2007 and the current brief, his actions at the time in question were probably goal directed [seeking money from the teller] and may not have been as spontaneous or impulsive as previously opined. He probably maintained some capacity to control himself, notwithstanding his psychotic state and apparent voices.

He was probably aware his actions would induce fear in the victim and were against the law, meaning he probably had some awareness of the consequences of his actions, and made some efforts to conceal his identity.

However, his acute psychosis and his schizophrenic illness generally probably still contributed to the poor judgment and apparent ambivalence he displayed when writing the hold-up note and committing the robbery in question on 20/09/13 and remain relevant mitigating factors.”


	
	The applicant’s counsel at the sentence hearing accepted that a custodial sentence was necessary in light of the seriousness of the offence and the prior history in Western Australia. He submitted that it was a “very low key bank robbery” and that there was no evidence that the applicant was armed with anything but his note. He contended that the applicant’s moral culpability was substantially lessened by his mental impairment and his compromised ability to judge his own actions and their effect on others.
	
	
	Mr Townsend also submitted that the applicant was an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence because of his psychiatric illnesses, and that, accordingly, that factor ought be given little weight. He did, however, concede that, notwithstanding his mental illness, specific deterrence was a little more significant having regard to his previous offending. When addressing the danger the applicant posed to the community, Mr Townsend submitted that the applicant was taking medication at the time of the offending, although it was not working, and that he would benefit from the additional support from the parole officers on his release in order to remain compliant with medication. He contended, in effect, that future dangerousness could be minimised with medication and supervision.
	
	
	Mr Townsend also submitted that, although there was some degree of planning, in that it was not a purely impulsive act, the level of planning was not such as to amount to an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Act).
	
	
	The Crown accepted that the level of planning was not at the level required for s 21A(2)(n) of the Act but contended that it was not “a spontaneous brain snap” as Dr Furst thought initially, before additional information was provided to him by the Crown. The Crown submitted that the conduct displayed on 20 September 2013 was similar to that displayed in Western Australia in 2007 when he committed a series of similar offences.
	
	
	The Crown relied on the threat of a weapon as an aggravating factor (s 21A(2)(c) of the Act) as well as the circumstance that the victim was a vulnerable victim (s 21A(2)(l) of the Act). The Crown accepted that the plea was entered at the earliest available opportunity.
	
	
	In response to the applicant’s submission that he told the victim that he would not hurt her, the Crown referred to R v Speeding [2001] NSWCCA 105 in which Giles JA (Wood CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing) said at [24]:
	


“I would put it more strongly. I do not think any weight at all could be attached to the so-called reassurances. They were no more than an indication to the victims that they would not be hurt provided they did exactly what the respondent wanted, which cannot have been any real comfort to them. What his Honour said, to my mind, really did not properly address the effect on the victims which the statements of the victims placed before him revealed, being one of great distress notwithstanding reassuring words the respondent might have intended to have used. The so-called reassurance was unlikely to, and did not, detract from the threat of violence or alleviate the distress caused. When robbery is committed under the threat of a knife, I see no room for alleviating the seriousness of the offence and, as part of that seriousness, the possible traumatic effect on those threatened, by the use of so-called reassuring words.”


	
	The Crown also referred to R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 and, in particular, the following passage of the reasons of Gleeson CJ at 71:
	


“The existence of such a causal relationship [between the mental illness and the offending conduct] in a particular case does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence, any more than the absence of such a causal connection produces the automatic result that an offender will not receive a lesser sentence in a particular case. For example, the existence of a causal connection between the mental disorder and the offence might reduce the importance of general deterrence, and increase the importance of particular deterrence or of the need to protect the public.”

The remarks on sentence


	
	In the remarks on sentence Christie ADCJ recounted the facts as set out above. He referred to the applicant’s criminal history in the following terms:
	


“One of the factors facing the Court is that this man committed offences quite similar in Perth and the details of those offences are contained in exhibit B and I shall just summarise them briefly: they involved a burglary and commit the offence of stealing, that was at a Caltex Star Service Station in Perth; an armed robbery, that was at a Caltex Fine Enterprises, presumably some sort of petrol station in Perth; attempted armed robbery at the BP Australia in Ballajura, which I assume is somewhere near Perth; an armed robbery at the Caltex Star Mart at Malaga, which I assume is somewhere near Perth and an attempted armed robbery at the Caltex North at Malaga, in the same place but a different premises. For those offences the inmate received a sentence of two years and six months imprisonment, that was from 28 January 2011. There were several other sentences, some of which were concurrent, some of which were cumulative.”


	
	His Honour was not satisfied that the note, although written on St George Bank stationery, was written before the applicant entered the branch of the Bendigo Bank where he committed the robbery. His Honour said, of the Crown’s submission that planning was an aggravating factor:
	


“I am not myself absolutely certain as to what degree of planning I should find and how much of it was spontaneous or impulsive.”


	
	The sentencing judge expressly referred to the victim impact statement of the bank teller, Ms Ross.
	
	
	His Honour referred to the amount that had been recovered. His Honour returned to the prior offences in the following passage:
	


“I need to take into account, obviously, that the offences that he committed in Perth, as I say, five or six years ago, they were numerous and they were not dissimilar to this matter.”


	
	The sentencing judge addressed the impact on the victim and the objective seriousness of the offence in the following terms:
	


“I regard the repetitive nature of this type of offence and particularly the effect that this type of offence has on people like bank tellers as being serious.”


	
	His Honour also referred to the need to take into account the applicant’s psychological and psychiatric condition. His Honour indicated that the sentence would be seven and a half years, to which a discount of 20% was applied by reason of the plea of guilty. There was a finding of special circumstances. The total term was six years with a non-parole period of three and a half.
	
	
	After the delivery of the remarks, the applicant’s counsel asked whether his Honour had said that a discount of 20% would be applied and referred to the circumstances that the applicant, having entered a plea in the Local Court, would normally be entitled to a maximum discount. His Honour responded:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Normally he would. In this particular case because I’m not completely certain of some of the facts as to whether there was preparation and so on – I don’t have to give the maximum. And that’s why I specifically decided on 20% rather than 25.”

The grounds of appeal

The first ground: inadequate discount of 20%


	
	In the present case, the discount of 20% manifested error. His Honour expressly took into account the level of planning in deciding to discount the sentence by 20% rather than 25%. This was an irrelevant consideration. The relevant considerations are listed in s 22 of the Act and relate to the fact, timing and circumstances, of a plea. The level of planning has no bearing on the utilitarian value of the plea. As the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) said in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [27]:
	


“The [sentencing] judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached.”


	
	Accordingly, by taking into account an irrelevant consideration, his Honour’s discretion to determine the discount under s 22 of the Act miscarried and is required to be re-exercised by this Court.
	
	
	Furthermore, although the question of the percentage discount for a plea of guilty pursuant to s 22 of the Act is a matter of discretion, there is a general expectation (although not a rule) that, where a plea is entered at the earliest available opportunity, the maximum discount of 25% will be applied. The reason for this is that the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea is determined largely by the timing of the plea: see the Guideline Judgment of R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [154] and R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32(1)]. In the present case, there was no indication from his Honour, prior to the imposition of the sentence, that this would not occur. Moreover, the Crown, by accepting that the plea was entered at the first available opportunity, can be taken to have accepted that the highest discount was appropriate.
	
	
	In my view, it is appropriate in the circumstances to allow a discount of 25% by reason of the applicant’s plea of guilty which was made at the first available opportunity. For this reason, leave to appeal ought be granted and the appeal allowed.
	


The second ground: failure to consider the applicant’s mental health and the opinion of Dr Furst


	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour incorrectly applied R v Lawrence [2005] NSWCCA 91. Of present relevance, the applicant in R v Lawrence contended that the sentencing judge erred in failing properly to take into account the evidence relating to her psychological condition and the causes of, and background to, her drug dependency.
	
	
	At [23]-[24] Spigelman CJ (Grove and Bell JJ agreeing) said:
	


“[23] Although DSM(IV) has come to be widely used for the purposes of categorisation, it should not be assumed that because, as a result of the rather tortuous process by which DSM(IV) is compiled and amended, some kind of recognition is given, by means of affixing a label to a mental condition, that any such condition is such as to attract the sentencing principle that less weight is to be given to general deterrence. That may not be true of a particular condition. . . .

[24] Weight will need to be given to the protection of the public in any such case. Indeed, one would have thought that element would be of particular weight in the case of a person who is said to have what a psychiatrist may classify as an Antisocial Personality Disorder. Nevertheless, as I am satisfied his Honour did give the element of general deterrence less weight than he would otherwise be entitled to give in the absence of the psychologist's report, it is not necessary to specify a view on the particular classifications involved in this case. I would not uphold this ground of appeal.”


	
	R v Lawrence was considered in R v Windle [2012] NSWCCA 222, in which this Court allowed a Crown appeal against a sentence on the ground of manifest inadequacy. The respondent was sentenced for attempting to strangle a fellow inmate at Long Bay Gaol with intent to murder. Justice Basten, at [22], said:
	


“[22] The Director did not submit that the offender was not suffering from a serious mental illness, nor that that was not an appropriate consideration to be taken into account. Although the court was referred to the remarks of Spigelman CJ in R v Lawrence [2005] NSWCCA 91 at [22], to the effect that some mental conditions, whilst qualifying as psychiatric illnesses, might not justify less weight being given to general deterrence, it was not suggested that the mental condition suffered by the offender fell into such a category. Alternatively, if that inference were intended, it should not be accepted.”


	
	Justice Basten considered that the evidence of mental illness showed “an element of dangerousness and lack of insight into the causes of the violence revealed by this offence.” However, at [57], his Honour said of protection of the public:
	


“In relation to the protection of society at large, the factor is one which, in the circumstances, can be given relatively little weight. There is no evidence supporting a conclusion that there will be improvement in the immediate future. Nevertheless, the offence cannot involve an indeterminate sentence and, in any event, the punishment for the crime must not exceed a proper sentence, disregarding the need to protect society.”


	
	The present applicant sought to derive from [22] in R v Windle the proposition that what Spigelman CJ said in R v Lawrence applied only to persons having “anti-social personality disorders” and not to persons having more severe psychotic disorders. I reject this submission. A fair reading of Basten JA’s reasons does not support this contention.
	
	
	The relevance of, and weight to be given to, mental illness in the sentencing process are matters of judgment in the circumstances of the particular case, having regard to the purposes of sentencing as listed in s 3A of the Act, including: punishment (s 3A(a)); general and specific deterrence (s 3A(b)); and protection of the community (s 3A(c)). As Gleeson CJ explained in R v Engert, mental illness which results in lack of insight might lessen the weight to be accorded to general deterrence, while at the same time increasing the importance of protection of the community as a factor. It would be at odds with the principles of sentencing for rules to be constructed by reference to particular psychiatric diagnoses or the way in which sentences have been imposed in decided cases on those suffering from particular illnesses. As was said by the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) in Markarian v The Queen at [27]:
	


“Express legislative provisions apart, neither principle, nor any of the grounds of appellate review, dictates the particular path that a sentencer, passing sentence in a case where the penalty is not fixed by statute, must follow in reasoning to the conclusion that the sentence to be imposed should be fixed as it is. . . . As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies.”

[Footnotes omitted]


	
	In my view, the remarks on sentence in the present case show that his Honour took adequate account of relevant circumstances, including the following:
	



	
	Dr Furst’s evidence that, although the applicant was psychotic at the time of the offending conduct he probably maintained some capacity to control himself and was probably aware that his actions would induce fear in the victim and were illegal;
	
	
	Dr Furst’s diagnoses that the applicant suffered from various psychiatric conditions including treatment-resistant schizophrenia;
	
	
	the subject offending demonstrated some short-term planning (although not such as to bring it within s 21A(2)(n) of the Act); and
	
	
	the applicant had committed similar offences in a similar way in Perth some years before.
	



	
	The first and third of these matters were particularly relevant to specific deterrence. The second and fourth matters were relevant to the protection of the public. The weight to be given to these factors, and others, was a matter of the sentencing judge’s discretion. I am not persuaded that his Honour failed to consider Dr Furst’s opinion or erroneously applied R v Lawrence (which, in any event, turned on its own facts). The second ground has not been made out.
	


The third ground: manifest excess


	
	The third ground, manifest excess, is a conclusion, which may be informed by a finding of specific error but does not require specific error to be identified: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6].
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is 14 years’ imprisonment. This is a relevant legislative guidepost: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27].
	
	
	The starting point for the sentence imposed (before the reduction for the plea of guilty) was seven and a half years. The relevant factors included: the nature of the offending; the substantial emotional harm to the victim; applicant’s criminal history, which included convictions for similar offending; and the maximum penalty.
	
	
	The harm to the victim was of particular relevance in the present case and amounted to an aggravating factor. Robbery does not always cause emotional harm to a victim and therefore is not a necessary part of the offence. In the present case the victim impact statement established that “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”: s 21A(2)(g) of the Act; R v Tuala [2015] NSWCCA 8 at [77]-[81] per Simpson J.
	
	
	That the applicant did not, in fact, have a gun or indeed any other weapon, although he informed the victim that he did, had the consequence that the offence was robbery rather than armed robbery. However his threat to use a weapon was an aggravating circumstance. It engendered in the victim fear for her life. She was not to know that the applicant was lying and had no gun. In all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. Accordingly, the third ground has not been made out.
	


Re-sentencing


	
	Having regard to the sentencing judge’s error in assessing the discount for the plea, it is necessary to resentence the applicant pursuant to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). This Court is required to exercise its sentencing discretion independently: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601. In the present case, this task can be undertaken by reference to the Agreed Facts, the undisputed findings of the sentencing judge and the evidence which was before his Honour. These matters have been set out in detail above.
	
	
	It is also necessary to take into account the two affidavits on which the applicant relied for the purposes of re-sentencing: his affidavit of 9 October 2015 and that of Frances Low, his solicitor, which was affirmed on 8 October 2015. The applicant has undertaken several courses while in custody, both vocational and also related to drugs and alcohol. The applicant deposed to his belief that his schizophrenia is now controlled by medication. He is regularly monitored. He also deposed to his intention to obtain regular help and treatment from the Campbelltown Mental Health Service on his release. Ms Low annexed extracts from clinical notes made in respect of the applicant that show that during the period 26 February 2015 to 17 September 2015 he has been stable and compliant with medication.
	
	
	Although the affidavit material provides some support for the proposition that the applicant may be able, on release, to control his schizophrenia, it does not substantially alleviate my concern about his future dangerousness. While his schizophrenia appears to be under control while he is in custody, there is, having regard to the history, a substantial risk of re-offending. Moreover, I regard the objective seriousness of the offence as being relatively high, because of his threat to use a firearm and the understandable fear that this engendered in the victim. It is also significant, as the sentencing judge found, that the applicant had committed several offences previously in a relevantly similar way.
	
	
	I agree with the sentencing judge that there should be a finding of special circumstances by reason of the applicant’s mental condition which will mean that, if parole is granted, he will be subject to a longer period of supervision in the community than if the statutory ratio were applied without adjustment. I propose that the ratio between the non-parole period and the total term be adjusted from 75% to 60%.
	
	
	In all the circumstances I consider seven years to be an appropriate starting point for the sentence, to which a discount of 25% ought be applied for the plea of guilty. This results in a total term of five years and a three months, with a non-parole period of three years and one month. The commencement date is 25 September 2013. The earliest date on which the applicant is eligible for release on parole is 24 October 2016.
	


Proposed orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Allow the appeal.
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed by Christie ADCJ on 8 July 2014 and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant to a term of imprisonment of five years and three months commencing 25 September 2013, with a non-parole period of three years and one month.
	



	
	The earliest date on which the applicant may be released on parole is 24 October 2016.

2768165,DPP v Pinn [2015] NSWSC 1684,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By summons filed on 28 August 2015 the plaintiff appeals from a decision of the Local Court on 8 May 2015 to dismiss eight charges of knowingly contravene a restriction specified in an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) contrary to s 14(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW) (the Act). The plaintiff’s appeal is brought pursuant to s 56(1)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).
	
	
	A supplementary notice amending the grounds in the summons was filed on 15 October 2015. The second ground was not pressed. The first and third grounds are as follows:
	


“(i)   Holding that in order for the prosecution to establish the admissibility of the interim apprehended violence order made against the defendant, it was necessary for the prosecution either to provide affidavit evidence from the Registrar of the Court as to the court records or to have the Local Court issue a subpoena to those records.

   …

(iii)   Holding that in the absence of evidence of provenance / authenticity the 3 documents were inadmissible, authenticity / provenance not being a ground of inadmissibility under the Evidence Act 1995. If a document is relevant to a fact at issue (here the existence of an IAVO at the time of the alleged offences and the defendant’s knowledge of that IAVO) then it is admissible under s.56 of the Evidence Act 1995, s. 58 of that Act enabling the Court to examine the document and to draw the Court’s own inferences from the document as to its authenticity / identity.”


	
	In the proceedings in this Court, Ms Webster SC, who appeared on behalf of the defendant (in this Court but not in the court below), conceded that the evidence which had been rejected by the Magistrate was relevant and admissible and that the Magistrate erred in declining to admit it. Accordingly, the defendant accepted that the appeal ought be allowed; the Magistrate’s dismissal of the charges ought be set aside; and that an order ought be made to remit the matter to the Local Court for hearing in accordance with law.
	


Background facts


	
	On 27 November 2014 the defendant was charged with stalk/intimidate with intent to cause fear and physical harm. The alleged victim of the offence was the defendant’s former partner, with whom he shared three children. A provisional AVO was made on that day and served on him by police.
	
	
	On 4 December 2014 the defendant was charged with contravene an AVO. On that day Magistrate Huber made an interim AVO against the defendant (IAVO) at the Waverley Local Court. The bench sheet recorded that the defendant was in attendance. The order was sent to the Commissioner of Police as required by s 77 of the Act (see below) and posted on the police intranet. A copy of the sealed IAVO was placed on the Local Court file. The order contained the following statement:
	


“The defendant was present in court when the order was made.”


	
	On 31 December 2014, eight charges of knowingly contravene a restriction specified in an AVO were laid against the defendant for offences said to have occurred between 10 December 2014 and 30 December 2014. The AVO to which the charges related was the IAVO.
	
	
	The hearing of the charges was listed before Huber LCM on 28 April 2015.
	


Relevant legislative provisions

The Act


	
	Section 3(1) of the Act defines AVO as including an interim AVO.
	
	
	Section 14 of the Act, which is contained in Part 3, relevantly provides:
	


“14 Offence of contravening apprehended violence order

(1) A person who knowingly contravenes a prohibition or restriction specified in an apprehended violence order made against the person is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 2 years or 50 penalty units, or both.

(2) A person is not guilty of an offence against subsection (1) unless:

(a) in the case of an apprehended violence order made by a court, the person . . . was present in court when the order was made, or

. . .”


	
	Section 22 of the Act, which is contained in Part 6, relevantly provides:
	


“22 Interim court orders

(1) A court may, on application made in accordance with Part 10, make an interim apprehended domestic violence order or an interim apprehended personal violence order if it appears to the court that it is necessary or appropriate to do so in the circumstances.

. . .

(3) An interim court order may be made by a court whether or not:

(a) the defendant is present at the proceedings, or

(b) the defendant has been given notice of the proceedings.

. . .

(5) If an interim court order is made by a court:

(a) the court is to require the defendant to appear at a further hearing of the matter by the court as soon as practicable after the interim court order is made, and

(b) the court may, at the further hearing or an adjourned further hearing, make a final apprehended violence order in the same terms as the interim court order or with variations or may revoke the interim court order (whether or not the defendant appears at any such further hearing).

(6) An interim court order has, while it remains in force, the same effect as a final apprehended violence order.”


	
	If the defendant is present in court when an interim court order is made, the court must explain to him or her: the effect of the order; the consequences that might follow for its contravention; and the rights of the defendant and the protected person named in the order: s 76(1). The court must also provide the defendant with a written explanation of these matters: s 76(3).
	
	
	Section 77 of the Act requires the Registrar of the court that makes an interim AVO to: prepare a copy of the order and (if the defendant is present in court) serve a copy of it personally on the defendant; or (if the defendant is not in court when the order is made) arrange for a copy of the order to be served personally on the defendant by a police officer or such other person as the Registrar thinks fit; or, if the defendant is in court when the order is made but the Registrar is unable to serve a copy of the order on the defendant personally, arrange for a copy to be sent by post to the defendant.
	
	
	Section 77(7) requires the Registrar to cause a copy of the order and a copy of any application for an order to be forwarded to the Commissioner of Police.
	
	
	There is no statutory requirement in the Act for the defendant to sign the order or acknowledge its service by signature, or otherwise.
	


The Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)


	
	Several sections of the Evidence Act were referred to before the Magistrate and in this Court. They are set out below to the extent necessary.

(b) was made in connection with an investigation relating or leading to a criminal proceeding.

(4) If:

(a) the occurrence of an event of a particular kind is in question, and

(b) in the course of a business, a system has been followed of making and keeping a record of the occurrence of all events of that kind,

the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence that tends to prove that there is no record kept, in accordance with that system, of the occurrence of the event.

(5) For the purposes of this section, a person is taken to have had personal knowledge of a fact if the person’s knowledge of the fact was or might reasonably be supposed to have been based on what the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived (other than a previous representation made by a person about the fact).

144 Matters of common knowledge

(1) Proof is not required about knowledge that is not reasonably open to question and is:

(a) common knowledge in the locality in which the proceeding is being held or generally, or

(b) capable of verification by reference to a document the authority of which cannot reasonably be questioned.

The hearing of the charges against the defendant before Huber LCM

The first day: 28 April 2015


	
	In addition to the eight charges referred to above, the defendant was charged with common assault (contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) and damage to property (contrary to s 195 of the Crimes Act). The hearing of all ten charges was listed before Huber LCM on 28 April 2015.
	
	
	Proof of the eight charges under the Act required the prosecution to prove, relevantly, the IAVO; and that the defendant was present in court at the time the IAVO was made.
	
	
	At the hearing on 28 April 2015 the police prosecutor tendered the IAVO. The defendant’s representative, Mr Chhabra, objected on the grounds of relevance. He contended that because the defendant had not signed the IAVO it had “no provenance”; could not be “what it purports to be without a signature”; and “is ink on a page at this time”.
	
	
	In response to the objection to the IAVO, the prosecutor called Constable McCarron, the Officer in Charge. He deposed that he had obtained a copy of IAVO from Court Notices on the police intranet, which he explained was what the police had received from the Local Court when the IAVO had been made. He also gave evidence that the IAVO was part of the brief that was served on the defendant.
	
	
	After the morning adjournment, Constable McCarron gave further evidence that, during the adjournment, he had asked at the Registry of the Waverley Local Court for the IAVO from the court file. The document which was provided by the Registry corresponded with the IAVO he had obtained from the police intranet. Constable McCarron also gave evidence that he had inspected the bench sheet for the hearing on 4 December 2014, which he said also indicated that the defendant was present in court on that day. The prosecutor sought to tender the bench sheet. Objection was also taken to the bench sheet, which was rejected.
	
	
	The prosecutor renewed the tender of the IAVO. Mr Chhabra added to his earlier relevance objection the submission that the document contained a statement that the defendant was present in court which was hearsay evidence and therefore inadmissible to prove that the defendant was actually present unless the IAVO was a business record within the meaning of s 69 of the Evidence Act. Mr Chhabra contended that the IAVO was not a business record and, in any event, fell within the prohibition in s 69(3). As the second ground (which concerned s 69) is not pressed it is not necessary for me to address further the argument based on s 69.
	
	
	The hearing of the charges continued. The protected person gave evidence. Over the defendant’s objection her Honour adjourned the hearing to 8 May 2015 to enable the prosecution to present further evidence in relation to the tender of the IAVO, on which the prosecution case in respect of the eight charges against the Act depended.
	


The second day: 8 May 2015


	
	At the resumed hearing the prosecutor sought to tender the bench sheet and the tape of the hearing on 4 December 2014 on the voir dire on the admissibility of the IAVO. The defendant’s representative objected to both the bench sheet and the tape and submitted that the IAVO, the bench sheet and the tape ought be rejected. He contended that the only route to admissibility of the documents was if they could be shown to be business records pursuant to s 69. He submitted that supporting affidavits as provided for by ss 170, 171 and 172 of the Evidence Act were required or that the prosecution could have obtained a s 178 certificate to establish that the IAVO was made.
	
	
	The defendant’s representative relied on National Australia Bank v Rusu [1999] NSWSC 539; 47 NSWLR 309 in which Bryson J rejected documents which purported to be bank statements of the account conducted by the second defendant at the Advance Bank on the basis that his Honour was not persuaded to the relevant standard of their authenticity.
	
	
	Her Honour rejected the tender of the tape, without listening to it, on the ground that its provenance was not proved by an affidavit either from the Registrar of the Local Court at Waverley or from the transcriptions department. Her Honour also rejected the bench sheet, without reading it.
	
	
	The prosecutor renewed the tender of the IAVO on the footing that Constable McCarron had given evidence as to its provenance. The Magistrate again rejected the tender.
	


The reasons of the Magistrate for rejecting the IAVO and associated documents


	
	Her Honour delivered reasons ex tempore for rejecting the tender of all three documents: the IAVO, the bench sheet; and the tape. Her Honour said that she was not satisfied that the documents were in admissible form or had been accompanied by the appropriate documents. Her Honour accepted the defendant’s submissions that the only basis on which those documents could be admitted was s 69 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The Magistrate noted the prosecutor’s reliance on: Constable McCarron’s evidence of the IAVO and how he had obtained it from the Court via the police intranet; s 144(1)(b) of the Evidence Act in relation to the bench sheet; and s 183 of the Evidence Act. Her Honour also referred to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Air New Zealand (No. 1) (2012) 207 FCR 448 (ACCC v Air New Zealand (No. 1)) and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2005] NSWSC 417 (ASIC v Rich), to which she had been referred by the prosecution.
	
	
	Her Honour accepted that relevance was the starting point and then addressed the question of “authenticity”. Her Honour then addressed s 69 of the Evidence Act but did not ultimately make a determination whether the documents were admissible under that section.
	
	
	The Magistrate then outlined the various ways in which the prosecutor could have tendered the documents (the IAVO, the bench sheet and the tape); proved that the IAVO had been made; and proved that the defendant was present in Court. Her Honour listed the following:
	



	
	providing an affidavit from a proper officer or Registrar (to prove the IAVO, the bench sheet or the tape);
	
	
	issuing a subpoena to the Registrar (to prove the IAVO, the bench sheet or the tape);
	
	
	issuing a subpoena to the prosecutor who appeared on 4 December 2012 who could have given evidence as to whether the defendant was in court on that day when the IAVO was made; and
	
	
	issuing a subpoena to the relevant domestic violence officer who was present on 4 December 2012 who could have given evidence that the IAVO was made and that the defendant was present.
	



	
	As the three documents had been rejected, the prosecution could not prove the eight charges involving breach of the IAVO, which were accordingly dismissed.
	


The grounds of appeal

The first ground: what was required to prove the IAVO


	
	The prosecutor was required to prove the making of the IAVO as an ingredient of the charge brought against s 14(1) of the Act and was therefore obliged, as part of the proof of the prosecution case, to tender the order itself. I accept the plaintiff’s contention that the evidence given by Constable McCarron (that he had printed out the order from the police intranet) was sufficient to establish the provenance of the IAVO. Once its provenance was established, the document, which was plainly relevant, was admissible.
	
	
	Its provenance was further established by the tender of the bench sheet and his evidence that he had compared the IAVO on the court file with the IAVO which he had printed out and found that they corresponded. Her Honour was in error in rejecting the bench sheet as a record of what had occurred in court on 4 December 2014.
	
	
	Once the IAVO was admitted (for the purpose of proving that the order was made and its terms), s 60 of the Evidence Act applied and the statement that the defendant was present was in evidence and could be used for all purposes, including the hearsay purpose, to establish that he was in fact present.
	


Ground 3: erroneous approach to considerations of admissibility


	
	Her Honour appears to have placed significant reliance on the statements of Bryson J in National Australia Bank v Rusu and refused to apply s 58 of the Evidence Act to draw such inferences as were open by an examination of the IAVO, the bench sheet and the tape.
	
	
	The plaintiff contended that National Australia Bank v Rusu ought not be followed and relied on the decision of Perram J in ACCC v Air New Zealand (No. 1) in which his Honour declined to follow it on the basis that it was plainly wrong. It is unnecessary, for the purposes of the present proceedings, to express a concluded view whether National Australia Bank v Rusu ought be followed. In any event, I consider National Australia Bank v Rusu to have turned on its particular facts and circumstances. These circumstances included (as appears from Bryson J’s reasons) that: the documents were apparently incomplete; they were sought to be used to establish a substantial liability; and the defendants were unrepresented, were able to speak no more than a little English and were assisted by their son in the proceedings. However, in order to understand the errors in the Magistrate’s reasoning which led to her rejection of relevant, admissible evidence, it is necessary to consider National Australia Bank v Rusu in some detail.
	
	
	In that case, the question was whether certain documents met the requirements of business records, not only as to their provenance (which was established by their production on subpoena) but as to whether they were prepared by someone who could be expected to have had personal knowledge of the facts contained therein (as required by s 69(2) of the Evidence Act). His Honour was not, in the circumstances of that case (set out above), prepared to draw such inferences from the documents themselves. Accordingly, his Honour rejected the tender.
	
	
	His Honour said:
	


“[28]   So far as I am aware there is no judgment which has decided that under the Evidence Act 1995 the authenticity of a document tendered in evidence may be determined simply on the basis of the form and contents of the document or on that basis taken with information about the source from which it was produced showing that it was produced on subpoena and by whom.

. . .

[34] If the court is to find a significant fact on which a large liability may depend, there is a need for the court to have some measure of confidence in the source of the court's belief that the fact exists. The court acts almost always on narrations which must have a human origin; not usually on the court's own knowledge or on states of fact which are taken to be incontestable. The balance of probabilities is not a demanding standard, as the possibility that the less probable state of fact may be the true one is very obvious, and makes civil justice very vulnerable to error. For the court to feel confident that it should act on any narration it is very important to have a human witness who has pledged, by oath or affirmation, that the narration is true: someone who is responsible for it. Business records may be incomplete; they often are. They record what there is perceived to be a business need to record, and that may be a small part or an oblique aspect of the objective event.”

[Emphasis added.]


	
	Justice Bryson’s dicta in National Australia Bank v Rusu at [28] and [34] (particularly the part in italics in the passage above) has been used in aid of various submissions to the effect that the authenticity of a document cannot be proved by an examination of the document; that a document “cannot prove itself”; and that documents must be verified or authenticated by live witnesses who can be cross-examined.
	
	
	Justice Bryson’s observations, which were apposite in the circumstances of that case, ought not be regarded as unqualified statements of general application. To read them in that way would be inconsistent with ss 58 and 183 of the Evidence Act. In these two provisions, Parliament has, in my view, evinced a clear intention that a document or thing sought to be tendered ought generally be examined before a ruling is made on an objection to its tender in order that all reasonable inferences can be drawn before the ruling is made. The inferences to be drawn include inferences as to identity and authenticity (s 58(1)); accordingly, in some cases, documents can “prove themselves”.
	
	
	What Bryson J actually said at [28] in National Australia Bank v Rusu was that his Honour had not located a judgment in which the form and contents of a document had been found to be sufficient to establish its authenticity, where the authenticity was disputed. As National Australia Bank v Rusu was decided in 1998, three years after the Evidence Act was passed, the absence of a judgment on the matter (particularly bearing in mind that unreported judgments were not then as readily available as they became, following the invention of the Internet) cannot be regarded as an indication that the proposition articulated (that the authenticity of a document could, in some circumstances, be established solely by its form and contents) was untenable.
	
	
	Magistrate Huber appears to have taken from [28] in National Australia Bank v Rusu that she was not permitted to draw inferences from the IAVO that Constable McCarron had printed out from the police intranet that it corresponded with the order made by the Court and that it was, in fact, the IAVO. Her Honour also appears to have been under the misapprehension (which may have arisen from [34] in Bryson J’s reasons) that she could not examine the bench sheet or hear the tape unless there was a live witness, such as the Registrar, to depose as to their provenance. This misapprehension arose, in my view, from a misunderstanding of National Australia Bank v Rusu and a failure to give effect to the Evidence Act and in particular s 58.
	
	
	Unlike the bank statements in National Australia Bank v Rusu, none of the three documents in the present case (the IAVO, the bench sheet or the tape) was part of a series Each of them had an independent existence and, in the case at least of the IAVO and the bench sheet, their provenance had been established by Constable McCarron’s oral evidence. There was, accordingly, no basis to reject them since they were plainly relevant to the offences charged, and admissible.
	
	
	The order itself which Constable McCarron had downloaded and compared with the order on the court file was the best evidence of the IAVO. The bench sheet corroborated its making. It was not necessary for Constable McCarron to be called to prove the IAVO. Indeed, the prosecution could have asked for the court file for the IAVO to be provided to the Magistrate for the purpose of the hearing of the charges against the defendant and called for the IAVO from that file to be tendered in the prosecution case. The IAVO bore the seal of the Local Court of New South Wales and was, by operation of s 150(1)(f) of the Evidence Act, deemed to have been duly sealed.
	
	
	Magistrate Huber was also in error in refusing to examine the bench paper or listen to the tape. Her Honour appeared to be under the misapprehension that she could not examine the bench sheet or hear the tape before deciding whether these documents were admissible. The process of determining the relevance and admissibility of evidence may require the tribunal of law to examine the document or thing sought to be tendered for the purposes of drawing inferences which may establish its relevance or admissibility. Her Honour was entitled, under s 58 of the Evidence Act, to do so in order to determine what reasonable inferences could be drawn from such examination. In the context of the tender, her Honour was obliged to examine the documents before ruling on their admissibility. Had her Honour examined the bench paper, she would have seen that it was what it purported to be, and admitted it.
	
	
	The approach which I have set out above is consistent with the orthodox and well established approach outlined by Perram J in ACCC v Air New Zealand (No. 1) in a series of propositions at [92].
	


Conclusion


	
	The process of tendering the IAVO for the purpose of establishing that an AVO had been made and for the purpose of proving (at least on a prima facie basis) that the defendant was present in court ought to have been a straightforward one, having regard to ss 58 and 60 of the Evidence Act. In the court below, it went awry for the reasons given above. The matter must be remitted.
	


Costs


	
	The plaintiff sought an order for costs on the basis that costs ought follow the event. The defendant resisted an order for costs on the basis that it had conceded in this Court that the Magistrate was in error and ought to have admitted two out of the three documents (the IAVO and the tape); and that it had consented to an order that the appeal be allowed and the matter remitted to the Local Court.
	
	
	In the alternative, Ms Webster SC submitted that, if an order for costs was made against the defendant, a certificate ought be granted under the Suitors Fund Act 1951 (NSW).
	
	
	I consider that the plaintiff is entitled to an order for costs to reflect the result of the proceedings.
	


Whether a certificate under the Suitors’ Fund Act ought be granted


	
	This Court has power under s 6(1)(a) to grant a certificate under the Suitors’ Fund Act. Whether a certificate ought be granted in the present case is a matter of discretion: s 6(5). In Mir Bros Developments Pty Ltd v Atlantic Constructions Pty Ltd (1985) 1 NSWLR 491, Kirby P outlined the applicable principles that guide the interpretation of s 6. His Honour identified the purpose of the statute as:
	


“the relief of a party who incurs or becomes liable for costs not through his own decision or conduct but because of some error of law of the court appealed from. . .”


	
	Much of the argument in the Local Court concerned s 69 of the Evidence Act. For reasons already given I do not need to consider s 69 since the second ground was not pressed. The conduct of the defendant’s representative in the Local Court in persisting in the objection to the IAVO in circumstances where its provenance had been established by Constable McCarron led the Magistrate into error. Moreover, the defendant’s legal representative’s insistence on the need for an affidavit from a Registrar was misconceived and based on a misreading of National Australia Bank v Rusu.
	
	
	The role of a Magistrate is undoubtedly demanding. Quick decisions, including rulings on evidence, are required to be made in circumstances where the facilities and assistance to hand are not always as comprehensive as in superior courts. The IAVO was plainly relevant and admissible. Once it was admitted, it was admitted for all purposes. The statement contained in it that the defendant was present in court could be used for the hearsay purpose of proving that the defendant was actually present in court on 4 December 2014. The defendant properly conceded all of these matters in this Court, having consistently contested and denied them in the Local Court. Her Honour was entitled to greater assistance.
	
	
	Having regard to the conduct of the defendant’s legal representative in the Local Court, I do not consider it appropriate to certify for the (albeit limited) recoupment of the costs out of a public fund.
	


Order


	
	For the foregoing reasons I make the following orders:
	



	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	Set aside the order of Magistrate Huber made on 8 May 2015 at the Waverley Local Court dismissing proceedings against the defendant for the offences of knowingly contravene prohibition or restriction in an apprehended violence order (eight counts).
	
	
	Remit the matter to the Local Court to be dealt with according to law.
	
	
	Order the defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the proceedings.
	
	
	Decline the defendant’s application for a certificate under s 6 of the Suitor’s Fund Act 1951 (NSW).

		26 November 2015",2015-11-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768166,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 19) [2015] NSWSC 1700,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: Following a trial which occupied some nine weeks, the jury has today convicted each of the Offenders KM, A2 and Shabbir Mohammedbhai Vaziri, of the primary counts brought against each of them.
	
	
	The offences found proved beyond reasonable doubt against KM and A2 are offences under s.45 Crimes Act 1900 of mutilating the clitoris of C1 and C2, the daughters of A2, on occasions (some years apart) when each girl was about seven years old.
	
	
	The Offender Vaziri was convicted by the jury of being an accessory after the fact to the primary offences committed by KM and A2 against C1 and C2.
	
	
	Following the jury's verdicts, the Crown has made a detention application seeking that each Offender be refused bail.
	
	
	It is necessary for the Court to consider matters relevant under the Bail Act 2013.
	
	
	An offence under s.45 Crimes Act 1900 is not a show cause offence for the purpose of the Bail Act 2013. The task for the Court is to undertake an assessment of unacceptable risk by reference to matters contained in the Act.
	
	
	The Crown has submitted, in effect, that custodial sentences are inevitable and that that bears upon the grant of bail at this time. The Crown has also adduced oral evidence as to the concerns of the Officer-in-Charge as to flight with respect to each of the Offenders, and submissions have been made, as well, on other aspects.
	
	
	Counsel for each Offender has submitted that bail ought not be refused and that the appropriate step is to grant bail on certain conditions.
	
	
	I should note a number of matters concerning this case. The maximum penalty for offences under s.45, and offences of being an accessory after the fact for those offences, is seven years’ imprisonment. The maximum penalty was increased to 21 years’ imprisonment at a time after the commission of these offences. Accordingly, for the purpose of this application and ultimately for the purpose of sentencing, the Court will have regard to the maximum penalty of seven years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	The Crown case with respect to each Offender involved an allegation of mutilation of the clitoris of each child in the form of cutting or nicking of the clitoris. There was medical evidence on this issue which involved an assessment of whether there were any visual signs of injury. There was, in addition to the medical evidence, the evidence of each young girl and other evidence, including a substantial body of telephone intercept and surveillance device evidence, which involved damaging conversations between the Offenders and others concerning the circumstances of what happened to each girl.
	
	
	As I observed in my judgment R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 2) [2015] NSWSC 1221 at [225], the degree of injury or harm established in a particular case under s.45 would be relevant to the question of penalty. In this context, I referred to s.21A(2)(g) and (3)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	As the Crown rightly points out, any assessment of injury, and the extent of injury, will involve consideration not only of the physical consequences of the offences, but the psychological and other consequences in both the short and longer terms. It should be noted, however, that this is not a case involving excision or infibulation. It is a case of mutilation in circumstances where I directed the jury, in accordance with my ruling in R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 2), that ""mutilate"" meant injure to any extent. These matters are relevant for present purposes in assessing the nature and gravity of the offences for which each Offender has been convicted.
	
	
	These are, on the face of it, serious offences. One Offender (A2) is the mother of the two girls who, on the evidence and on the verdicts, requested KM to carry out the procedure on each girl. KM has been convicted of serious offences involving a willingness to carry out acts of this sort. The evidence, of course, discloses that she has been, in her working life, a nurse and midwife. The Offender Vaziri, although not present when the offences were committed, was (on the electronic evidence) heavily involved in steps to divert the investigation and to suggest that members of the Dawoodi Bohra community say things to police which, according to the verdicts of the jury, were designed to effectively deflect the investigation of the offences of KM and A2.
	
	
	The nature of the penalties which may be imposed in this case will be a matter for careful consideration. It will be necessary, in reaching that decision, to have regard not only to the nature and circumstances of the offences, but the circumstances and background of the Offenders. Whether a custodial sentence is ultimately imposed is a matter which will be a live question at the sentencing hearing. For the purpose of this bail determination, having regard to the maximum penalties and other factors presently known, there are open questions as to the nature of the penalty which should be imposed in each case. I say no more because there is a need for careful consideration of evidence which will be presented at the sentencing hearing, and submissions by reference to that evidence, in the circumstances of this novel case. This appears to be the first case in this State that has gone to trial for offences of this type in the 20-odd years that the law has existed in this State.
	
	
	I turn to the question of unacceptable risk. ""Unacceptable risk"" for the purpose of s.19(2) Bail Act 2013 is an unacceptable risk that the accused person will fail to appear at any proceedings, commit a serious offence, endanger the safety of victims or individuals in the community or interfere with witness' evidence.
	
	
	The Crown argument here relates to the first of those factors, namely concerns as to appearance in the future on the part of the Offenders.
	
	
	It is necessary for the Court, as part of the consideration of unacceptable risk, to assess bail concerns for the purpose of s.17 of the Act. Relevant to the question of bail is the bail history of each Offender. Each of them was arrested and charged in September 2012. In the case of KM, the bail conditions which have been applicable for some considerable period have restricted only her conduct or contact with the children of the [A] family, and a condition that she not in any way conduct or facilitate female genital mutilation on any person. There has not been, for some time, any passport surrender condition, nor condition that she not attend any point of departure from Australia, nor any reporting condition.
	
	
	In the case of A2, there are conduct conditions with respect to her children. There has not been, since February 2014, a passport surrender condition or a condition concerning attending points of departure, nor has there been a reporting condition.
	
	
	In the case of Shabbir Vaziri, there is evidence from Detective Sergeant Stek of concerns that he had back in 2012. However, I note that for a considerable period now, the bail conditions concerning Mr Vaziri appear to have been only to be of good behaviour and to reside at an address in [xxx]. There has not been any passport surrender condition, nor a condition preventing attendance at an international point of departure, nor a reporting condition.
	
	
	There is evidence that the Offenders have, in fact, travelled overseas and returned from time to time, since the charges have been on foot.
	
	
	KM is 72 years old, she is a citizen of Australia and has resided in Australia since 1977. She has a daughter living in Australia and she is married to an Australian. She is retired from her former employment as a nurse or midwife and there is material before the Court indicating that she has had some serious health issues which affect her and which bear upon any assessment as to the risk of flight.
	
	
	A2 is now 38 years of age. She is married to A1 who is a [XXX]. She has four children living in Australia, two of whom, of course, are the young girls involved in this case. Any risk of flight in her case must have regard to the practical reality of the ties of her family, including the girls, in this country.
	
	
	Shabbir Vaziri, who is 59 years old, is not a citizen of Australia. He is here on a form of working visa. He has fewer ties in Australia. That said, as I have indicated, despite the flight concerns expressed, he has not failed to comply with any bail conditions and his bail conditions have in fact been relatively limited.
	
	
	I have regard, of course, to the very important consideration that each Offender has now been convicted by the jury of the offences. The presumption of innocence has been removed.
	
	
	To the extent that there is a risk of flight in this case, I am satisfied that that risk may be met by the imposition of appropriate conditions. I do propose to grant bail with respect to each of the Offenders.
	
	
	Reflecting the changed circumstances and the fact that each has been convicted, the conditions to be imposed will be significantly more onerous than those presently existing. I have regard to Mr Bouveng's submission that the Court has to be satisfied that conduct requirements as to conditions of bail are required. However, the factors which I have referred to so far, including the changed circumstances arising from the verdicts, warrant the conduct requirements which I intend to impose.
	
	
	With respect to each Offender, there will be a condition that each surrender his or her passport and not apply for any new passport or travel document. There will be a condition not to approach any point of international departure. There will be a residential condition and a reporting condition. In the case of each of the female Offenders, they will report two days a week. In the case of Mr Vaziri, he will report four days a week. I am satisfied, to the extent that his lack of ties and the fact that he is not an Australian citizen means that there ought be further restrictions upon him, that a reporting condition of that type is appropriate. There will also be in the case of Mr Vaziri a requirement that a surety in the sum of $10,000 be provided.
	


[Further submissions were made concerning the proposed conditions, including a submission that an increased reporting condition be imposed upon Mr Vaziri and not a surety condition - see T18-22]


	
	I had reached the point where I had indicated that I would grant bail with conditions to each Offender. The risk which calls for the imposition of conditions arises from the issue raised by the Crown with respect to non-appearance.
	
	
	I will leave in place, with respect to each of A2 and KM, the previous conditions aimed to provide continuing protection to the girl members of the [A] family.
	
	
	Firstly, with respect to KM, I am satisfied that bail should be granted with conditions. The conduct requirements which I set are as follows:
	



	
	She is to be of good behaviour.
	
	
	She is to live at [XXX].
	
	
	She is to report to the Campbelltown Police Station each Tuesday and Thursday between the hours of 8.00 am and midnight. To appear before the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 5 February 2016 and thereafter as required.
	
	
	She is to surrender her passport or passports, by delivery of that passport or passports to the Officer-in-Charge of the Campbelltown Police Station by 6.00 pm today.
	
	
	She is not to apply for any new passport or travel document.
	
	
	She is not to go within 300 metres of any point of departure from the Commonwealth of Australia.
	


[Further submissions were made concerning the proposed conditions - see T22-23]


	
	I add a further condition that KM must not, in any way, conduct or facilitate female genital mutilation on any person.
	
	
	I turn to the Offender A2. I am satisfied that bail should be granted with conditions. The conduct requirements with respect to A2 are as follows:
	



	
	She is to be of good behaviour.
	
	
	She is to live at [XXX].
	
	
	She is to report to Castle Hill Police Station each Tuesday and Friday between the hours of 8.00 am and 8.00 pm.
	
	
	She is to appear before the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 5 February 2016 and thereafter as required.
	
	
	She is to surrender her Australian and Kenyan passports to the Officer-in-Charge of Castle Hill Police Station by 3.00 pm today.
	
	
	She is not to apply for any new passport or travel document.
	
	
	She is not to go within 300 metres of any point of departure from the Commonwealth of Australia.
	


[Further submissions were made concerning the proposed conditions - see T23-24]


	
	I impose the following additional conditions with respect to A2:
	


(h)   She must not assault, molest, harass, threaten or otherwise interfere with the protected person or persons with whom she has a domestic relationship.

(i)   She must not engage in any other conduct that intimidates the protected person or persons with whom she has a domestic relationship.

(j)   She must not stalk the protected person or persons with whom she has a domestic relationship. The persons in need of protection specified as protected persons for the purpose of this condition are [XXX].


	
	With respect to the Offender Vaziri, I am satisfied that the risk referred to by the Crown concerning his attendance at Court is appropriately met by the fixing of bail with conditions. I impose the following conduct requirements:
	



	
	He is to be of good behaviour.
	
	
	He is to live at [XXX].
	
	
	He is to report to Auburn Police Station each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday between the hours of 8.00 am and 8.00 pm.
	
	
	He is to appear before the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 5 February 2016 and thereafter as required.
	
	
	He is to surrender his Indian passport to the Officer-in-Charge of the Auburn Police Station by 3.00 pm today.
	
	
	He is not to apply for any new passport or travel document.
	
	
	He is not to go within 300 metres of any point of departure from the Commonwealth of Australia.

		13 November 2015",2015-11-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768167,R v Maybir (No 7) [2015] NSWSC 1742,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: On 12 November 2015 I made a ruling that certain evidence already adduced as ""context evidence"" could be relied upon by the Crown as ""tendency evidence"" pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). I gave abbreviated reasons at the time but the following are my more detailed reasons for the ruling.
	


The Crown case


	
	The accused is on trial in respect of a number of assaults upon a 7 year-old child and in respect of the murder of that child. The events in question occurred during the course of a 4 month relationship of the accused with the deceased's mother, Ms Kayla James.
	
	
	The Crown case is to the effect that Ms James was a caring mother who did not mistreat the deceased or his two younger siblings. However, that changed after her relationship with the accused commenced in January 2013. He persuaded her that there was a need to adopt a stricter regime of discipline with the children which included physical punishments. The Crown case is that she came under his thrall and she endeavoured to comply with his disciplinary philosophy.
	
	
	Ms James has been sentenced for a number of acts of violence towards the deceased. She pleaded guilty to those offences and also to manslaughter on the basis of criminal negligence. The latter was based upon her failure to obtain medical attention for the deceased after he suffered a substantial head injury on the morning of 20 May 2013. He was found dead early the following morning.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the accused was responsible for administering harsh physical punishments to the children, particularly to the deceased. A great many injuries, including bruises, lacerations and broken bones, both aged and recent, were found on the body of the deceased during an autopsy examination. There is expert evidence to the effect that they cannot be explained by childhood accidents and are indicative of the deceased having been subjected to a considerable degree of physical violence and neglect over some period of time.
	
	
	The indictment contains 14 counts, the details of which are as follows:
	


1   Aggravated act of indecency on 8 March 2013

The accused filmed as he tried to get the deceased to insert his fingers into his younger brother's anus.

The accused has pleaded not guilty.

2-4   Assaults on 16 March 2013

5   Produce child abuse material

The accused commanded the deceased's younger brother and sister to slap and punch him. The accused filmed this and laughed as he did so.

The accused has pleaded guilty.

6-7   Assaults on 17 March 2013

While ""wrestling"" with the deceased the accused struck him a number of times, including by punching. The incident was filmed.

The accused has pleaded not guilty.

8   Assault on 31 March 2013

The accused struck the deceased with a spatula after he had soiled his pants.

The accused has pleaded guilty.

9   Assault on 31 March 2013

The accused hit the deceased around the back and buttocks with a stick after he fell to the ground exhausted while being forced to run along a beach.

The accused has pleaded not guilty.

10-11   Assault occasioning actual bodily, alternatively, assault on 31 March 2013

The accused punched the deceased to the face after he fell to the ground exhausted while being forced to perform ""interval running"".

The accused has pleaded not guilty.

12   Reckless wounding between 12 and 20 April 2013

The accused, with Ms James, repeatedly beat the deceased with a wooden board on the buttocks causing a number of lacerations.

The accused has pleaded guilty.

13   Produce child abuse material on 19 May 2013

The accused and Ms James filmed the deceased as he was forced to run on the spot while being interrogated for lying.

The accused has pleaded not guilty.

14   Murder on 20-21 May 2013

The accused violently assaulted the deceased during the course of which he inflicted blunt force trauma to the back of his head causing internal injuries that led to death.

The accused has pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter on the basis of criminal negligence for his failure to obtain medical attention. The latter was not accepted by the Crown.


	
	The Crown has also led evidence of a number of other acts of the accused towards the deceased which involved physical or psychological abuse.
	


The defence case


	
	The defence case is that the injuries that caused the death of the deceased were sustained as a result of a mishap when a ""wrestling"" manoeuvre went wrong and the deceased accidently fell to the floor.
	
	
	The accused's response to most of the assault charges to which he has pleaded not guilty is to the effect that the incidents alleged did not in fact occur. In relation to the assaults in counts 6 and 7 he contends that the acts were incidental to a playful wrestle with the deceased.
	
	
	The defence case also involves an assertion that it was Ms James who was responsible for the vast majority of the physical abuse of the deceased.
	


The asserted tendencies


	
	The Crown asserts that the accused had a tendency to act in a particular way, namely:
	


(a)   to assault young children in his care using his hands or objects for the purpose of disciplining or punishing them; and

(b)   to cause harm to young children in his care or to be indifferent to the harm caused to them.


	
	I have already ruled that certain evidence by the accused's former wife, Ms Naomi Brealey, may be used as evidence to establish these asserted tendencies: R v Maybir (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1737. At the time of making that ruling, reference was made by counsel to evidence of Ms James that would also be relied upon by the Crown to establish the tendencies. As that evidence was accepted to be admissible as ""context"" evidence, it was led on the basis that I would rule later as to whether the Crown would also be able to rely on it for tendency purposes.
	
	
	When submissions were made in relation to this tendency issue on 12 November 2015, the Crown indicated that it was also relying upon the evidence to establish a tendency of the accused to have a particular state of mind, namely:
	


(c)   an attitude of disdain, dislike and no respect towards the deceased; and

(d)   to get angry with the deceased.

The evidence relied upon to establish the tendencies


	
	The Crown set out the evidence in the form of the following table which I have slightly modified to give each item a unique number and to avoid identification of children:

	Items 1(a) and 6(b) in the table were the subject of the earlier ruling (R v Maybir (No 2)) and were allowed to be relied upon in support of tendencies (a) and (b).
	
	
	The Crown clarified that items 2 and 8-10 were relied upon specifically in relation to the tendencies (c) and (d).
	


Reasons


	
	Mr Brady accepted that because the evidence was already before the jury he could not realistically submit that there was a danger of unfair prejudice. That was an appropriate concession to make, with respect, but I have nonetheless borne in mind that I will be giving the jury the usual sort of directions that are required in relation to tendency evidence. (In this regard I am mindful of the suggested directions in the Criminal Trials Bench Book).
	
	
	An exception in relation to that concession was that in relation to items 8 to 10 the jury could misuse the evidence by reasoning that ""if someone got angry enough to do that, they would get angry enough to seriously hurt [the deceased]"". Rather than being a matter of prejudice, in my view this describes the probative value. The jury has evidence that the accused assaulted the deceased on a number of occasions but not to the extent of causing really serious bodily harm. But then they have the evidence that the deceased was, on the Crown case, violently assaulted by the accused on the morning of 20 May 2013. That would seem to be out of keeping with the previous levels of assault. However, in light of evidence which shows the degree of disdain, dislike and disrespect the accused had towards the deceased, and his ready resort to anger towards the deceased, the events of 20 May 2013 become significantly more explicable. It would, as the Crown Prosecutor pointed out, also serve to support a rejection of the accused's version of ""accident"".
	
	
	Mr Brady argued that some of the items were significantly different to some of the alleged incidents the indictment. I do not think that is a valid criticism. It is the overall force of the evidence that must be looked at. Moreover, s 97 requires that regard be had not only to the evidence ""by itself"" but also to ""other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence"" in the assessment of whether it has ""significant probative value"".
	
	
	In relation to items 14 to 18, Mr Brady argued that they did not establish any tendency because what is described is a result rather than an act. Further, he submitted that there was a ""competing inference"", namely that Ms James caused those injuries.
	
	
	Items 14 to 18 as they appear in the above table do describe a result but what the Crown is relying upon is the jury drawing an inference that the accused, in some fashion, caused each of those injuries. Whilst the Crown is somewhat hamstrung in alleging precisely how he did so, it relies upon the general thrust of the evidence, mainly of Ms James, that the accused behaved violently towards the deceased. Moreover, it was put to Ms James that she caused these injuries. Ms James denied such propositions. In these circumstances, as the Crown Prosecutor pointed out, the only other ""candidate"" is the accused. Accordingly, in my view these items are capable of being regarded by the jury as further evidence that the accused had either or both of tendencies (a) and (b).
	
	
	In my view, the combined effect of each of the items (aside from item 2 and 8 to 10) has powerful force in establishing tendencies (a) and (b) which, in turn, would have substantial probative value in making out the charge of murder as well as the various assault charges to which the accused has pleaded not guilty. This is particularly the case in relation to item 1(b) which is powerful evidence in connection with the finding at autopsy of bruising and other injury indicative of the deceased having been grabbed by the face in a manner consistent with that described by Ms James and Ms Brealey.
	
	
	Items 2 and 8 to 10, considered in conjunction with the other items, have powerful probative value in relation to the asserted tendencies (c) and (d). The manner in which I propose to direct the jury will safeguard adequately, in my view, against any risk of misuse.
	


Conclusion


	
	For the foregoing reasons I ruled that the evidence could be relied upon by the Crown as tendency evidence.

		20 November 2015",2015-11-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768177,R v Thoral (2) [2015] NSWDC 368,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: A little while ago I found Mr Thoral guilty on an offence of break enter and steal. I was then asked to deal with some matters on a s 166 certificate - an offence of possessing housebreaking implements and an offence of larceny relating to 3 credit cards.
	
	
	Mr Thoral was one of two people discovered by police in a car with the proceeds of a break enter and steal at various locations within the car. When found by police he had just broken into a patisserie and taken from it some drinks, some food stuff and some envelopes and their contents. Not a lot was really taken, not much damage was caused, certainly nothing gratuitous and these were retail premises rather than someone’s home.
	
	
	So although all break enter and steal offences are serious, this was not one of the more serious offences of that type. But that does not mean that Mr Thoral does not need to be sentenced to gaol for a significant period of time.
	
	
	He has a criminal history which is extensive. Break enter and steals appear on that history on a regular basis and there are many other offences as well. He has demonstrated a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law. It is notable that there are no offences of violence upon his criminal history which is perhaps commendable but his criminal history does demonstrate the need for a substantial component of personal deterrence to be built into the sentence I have to ultimately impose upon Mr Thoral.
	
	
	I also have to sentence him for two matters on a 166 certificate, one relating to possessing housebreaking implements, (these were the very implements used to break and enter into the shop and so he will receive no extra punishment for that offence) but the other offence relates to the larceny of three credit cards also found in his possession by police. That is a completely separate offence so a completely separate punishment is required for it.
	
	
	Mr Thoral was born in New Caledonia. Soon after his parents brought him to Australia they separated and he went to live with his father. His father worked in, ironically given the nature of the premises that Mr Thoral broke into, a patisserie and was rarely at home due to working long hours.  This was at a fairly crucial stage of Mr Thoral’s upbringing. He was left effectively unsupervised for large periods of his early teenage years. He began to frequent the local video store and there met up with older children who were a negative influence. Things went even further downhill when one of Mr Thoral’s associates from the video store broke into the family home. His father blamed him for what occurred and kicked him out of home. So at a very young age he was fending for himself on the streets.
	
	
	He tried to get his father to allow him to return home but his father’s position was unrelenting. Mr Thoral cannot be blamed for having reacted adversely to his father’s failure to provide an effective form of parental supervision as he was growing up and then effectively rejecting his role as a father when Mr Thoral was 13.
	
	
	In these circumstances Mr Thoral’s decision to begin taking drugs, a factor which has remained a problem for him to this day, can be viewed as a mitigating circumstance.
	
	
	In the guideline judgment of R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 AcrimR 149, a case primarily dealing with the guideline sentence for armed robbery, the Court considered the circumstances in which drug addiction could be a mitigating factor. One such circumstance was where the decision to begin using drugs was not really a matter of personal choice. I regard this to be such a case. To commence using drugs at around the age 13 is not to make a mature, well thought out, decision. Mr Thoral’s decision to commence his many offences, presumably in order, at least some of the time, to fund his drug addiction, has to be looked at in that light.
	
	
	This offence was committed whilst Mr Thoral was on parole. He had been released only 3 months before. At one stage whilst on bail he attempted a drug rehabilitation program on the Central Coast but this did not go well. His parole was revoked, not only because of the commission of the offence for which I must sentence him but also because he was not living where he was supposed to and because he was using drugs.
	
	
	The prospects of Mr Thoral’s rehabilitation are, at least in the short term, frankly poor. One day I expect that Mr Thoral will change his ways. One day he will realise the futility of the life that he has thus far led, measuring his life out in court dates and release dates it is terrible to see a life wasted as Mr Thoral has been living his life to date.
	
	
	Even giving full credit to Mr Thoral because of the circumstances in which he began using drugs and recognising as I have already mentioned that this is far from the worse type of break enter and steal offence, a substantial sentence is nevertheless required. The maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment is something which cannot be ignored. It is an indication to judges as to the seriousness with which offences of this type should be dealt. As I have already mentioned, personal deterrence is of particular importance in the case of this particular offender.
	
	
	I should mention the sentence imposed upon Mr Thoral’s co-offender, a Mr Costas. He got a s 9 bond in the Local Court. However it has to be noted that he pleaded guilty, unlike Mr Thoral and his criminal history was very different indeed from Mr Thoral’s. Although of course I have to ensure that Mr Thoral does not have a justifiable sentence of grievance when he compares the sentence I impose upon him with the sentence imposed upon his co‑offender there are substantial differences of which I have taken account. The subjective features of the two men were vastly different.
	
	
	I should mention before I impose sentence something of a technical problem. I found Mr Thoral guilty because of the evidence before me which satisfied me that he was involved in joint criminal enterprise with Mr Costas. However I note that Mr Thoral was not charged with and has not been found guilty of an aggravated form of the break enter and steal offence. Thus I will certainly not sentence as though he was in company at the time of this offence. I will sentence him on the basis that he was involved in joint criminal enterprise with Mr Costas but it is important to note that the factual circumstances on which I will sentence Mr Thoral did not involve both of them entering the premises and did not in any way involve Mr Thoral being in company with Mr Costas.
	
	
	I impose sentence as follows. For the larceny matter on the s 166 certificate I impose a fixed term of one months’ imprisonment to date from 13 May 2015. For the offence of possessing housebreaking implements, I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of two months to date from 13 June 2015. For the offence of break enter and steal I set a non-parole period of two years with a head sentence of 4 years to date also from 13 June 2015. This means that the non-parole period would expire on 12 June 2017 on which day Mr Thoral is eligible to be released to parole.
	
	
	As is obvious I found special circumstances in the offender’s favour, they relate to the need expressed in the psychological report tendered on his behalf for Mr Thoral to be assisted upon his release from custody to engage in further training employment and in order to deal with his drug problems.
	
	
	I will refer him to the compulsory drug treatment centre at Parklea gaol.

		18 February 2016",2015-11-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768181,R v Batcheldor [2015] NSWSC 1688,"Judgment

INTRODUCTION


	
	In August 2012, Lauren Mae Batcheldor (“the offender”) stood trial jointly with Richard Walsh (“Walsh”) in this Court in respect of two counts, namely:
	



	
	the specially aggravated kidnapping of Mathew Digby (“the deceased”); and
	
	
	the murder of the deceased.
	



	
	Both the offender and Walsh were found guilty by the jury in respect of each count, and were sentenced to terms of imprisonment: R v Batcheldor [2012] NSWSC 1398; R v Walsh [2012] NSWSC 1399.
	
	
	Appeals brought by each of the offender and Walsh against their respective convictions were heard by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 23 May 2014. On 10 November 2014, the Court dismissed Walsh’s appeal. On the same day, the Court allowed the offender’s appeal and ordered a re-trial: Batcheldor v R; Walsh v R [2014] NSWCCA 252.
	
	
	On 21 September 2015 the offender appeared before me and pleaded guilty to an indictment containing the following counts:
	



	
	that between the 22nd day of January 2010 and the 25th day of January 2010, in Wollongong in the State of New South Wales, whilst in the company of Richard Walsh, did detain Mathew Digby without his consent, with intent to obtain an advantage, namely to obtain information about property previously stolen (Count 1).
	
	
	between the 22nd day of January 2010 and the 25th day of January 2010, in Dapto in the State of New South Wales, knowing Richard Walsh to have committed the offence of murder upon Mathew Digby afterwards, did receive, harbour, maintain and assist the said Richard Walsh (Count 2).
	



	
	Count 1 is an offence contrary to s. 86(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. Count 2 is an offence contrary to s. 349(1) of the same Act and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years.
	
	
	The sentence proceedings concluded before me on 8 October 2015, at which stage I reserved my decision. The proceedings were then adjourned for a longer period than would normally be the case. This was at the request of the Crown, on behalf of the members of the deceased’s family who were absent overseas and who understandably wished to be in attendance.
	
	
	It is necessary that I emphasise at the outset that the offender is not being sentenced for the specially aggravated kidnapping of the deceased, nor is she being sentenced for his murder. Those were the charges in respect of which the offender was originally indicted. The Crown has chosen not to proceed in respect of those same charges. The Crown has presented an indictment against the offender in the terms set out in [4] above, and has accepted her pleas to the charges contained in that indictment.
	
	
	Notwithstanding those circumstances, it was submitted by the Crown that it was open to me to have regard to, and to essentially adopt, factual findings that I made when I previously sentenced the offender following her trial. If a finding which was previously made is open on the evidence which is now before me, that is one thing. However, I am not able to accept the submission that it is open to me to simply adopt my previous findings as a matter of course. The Crown has taken the course that I have outlined and, in doing so, has tendered, with the consent of senior counsel for the offender, an agreed statement of facts. Those facts set out the circumstances of the offending. They constitute, in large measure, the basis upon which I must determine the objective seriousness of such offending. It is not open to me to simply adopt, for the purposes of sentencing the offender on the current charges, factual findings I previously reached which were made following a trial and which were therefore based (at least in part) upon evidence given in the trial which is not presently before me. I make it clear that my determination of sentence in respect of the charges to which the offender has now pleaded guilty is based upon the evidence which has been put before me in these proceedings, and nothing else.
	
	
	I have received victim impact statements from the deceased’s parents, John and Dianne Digby, and from the deceased’s siblings, Martin Digby and Leighton Digby. It is clear from reading those statements that each of the members of the deceased’s family has suffered an indescribable loss. I extend the sympathy of the Court to each of them.
	


THE FACTS


	
	The agreed facts are as follows:
	


The relationship between the offender, Walsh and the deceased


	
	In January 2010 the offender was living at premises at 6 Brownlee Place, Albion Park Rail. She was a friend of Samantha Wells (“Wells”) who was Walsh’s partner. The offender had known Walsh for many years. Wells and Walsh resided at 26 Cabernet Drive, Dapto (“the Dapto premises”).
	
	
	The deceased moved to Wollongong in around September 2009. His parents rented premises for him in Sperry Street, Wollongong. He formed friendships with Wayne Nelson (“Nelson”) and Craig Migalka (“Migalka”), through whom he was introduced to the offender. Migalka commenced living at the deceased’s premises in about January 2010.
	


The burglary at the offender’s residence


	
	Between the evening of 14 January 2010 and the early hours of 15 January 2010 there was a burglary at the offender’s premises, in the course of which a number of items were stolen. The offender reported the burglary to the police and subsequently submitted a claim on her insurance policy. In the claim form, an extensive list of property was nominated as having been stolen, including a 9 ct gold necklace with a claimed value of $2,000.00, as well as a coin collection which was said to belong to Walsh and which had been left with the offender as security for a debt.
	
	
	Following the burglary, the offender commenced her own investigations by attending pawn shops in the Wollongong area. On the afternoon of 18 January 2010 she attended the “Cash Express” Pawn Shop in Wollongong with a friend, Evren Agdiran (“Agdiran”). She discovered that the deceased had pawned the necklace. The offender believed that the deceased had been involved in the burglary at her premises. She said to Agdiran (in reference to a proposed visit to the deceased’s premises):
	


“I’m going to go there and get my shit back. I’m going to baseball bat, smash the house”.


	
	The offender was mistaken in her belief that the deceased was involved in the burglary. The burglary was in fact committed by Migalka, Nelson and a third person, Ryan Sanchez (“Sanchez”). Migalka had given the deceased one of the necklaces which had been stolen from the offender’s premises, which the deceased had pawned. Other property stolen during the burglary was ultimately located at Nelson’s premises.
	


The offender and Walsh visit the deceased’s premises


	
	On the evening of 18 January 2010 the offender went to the deceased’s premises with Walsh and an associate, Cihan Karaoglu (“Karaoglu”), who was known by the nickname “G”. The offender had told both Walsh and Karaoglu that there might be jewellery at the premises. When they arrived, Michael Small (“Small”) who was a friend of the deceased, was present, although the deceased was not. Small had arrived that day from Sydney to stay with the deceased for a short time.
	
	
	At the offender’s request, Small contacted the deceased by telephone and told him that there were people at the premises who wished to see him. He asked the deceased to return home, following which Walsh and Karaoglu searched the deceased’s premises on behalf of the offender. No property belonging to the offender, and more specifically no property stolen in the course of the burglary of the offender’s premises, was recovered.
	
	
	The deceased was driven back to his premises by a friend, Tini Eli (“Eli”), and his de facto partner Christine Papani (“Papani”). The deceased told Eli that the “big boys” wanted to speak with him. When they arrived at the deceased’s premises Eli and Papani waited outside. The deceased went inside where he was questioned about the circumstances in which he obtained the offender’s necklace. The deceased denied being responsible for the burglary. He told the offender, Walsh and Karaoglu that he had obtained the necklace from a prostitute. They demanded that he redeem the necklace from the Pawn Shop.
	
	
	The offender, Walsh and Karaoglu then left the premises along with the deceased. The deceased got into his vehicle which was parked at the premises, and as he did so threats were made to him which were overheard by Eli and Papani.
	
	
	At about 1.35pm on 20 January 2010 the deceased and the offender attended the Cash Express Pawn Shop. The deceased paid $300.00 to redeem the necklace which he gave back to the offender.
	
	
	Between 2.30pm on 18 January 2010 (when the offender located the necklace at the Pawn Shop) and 1.45pm on Wednesday 20 January 2010 (shortly after the necklace was redeemed) there were 17 telephone calls/text messages between the offender and the deceased.
	


Telephone contact and the meeting at Beaton Park


	
	Two of the deceased’s neighbours, Judith Forbes and Garry Maguire, saw him fixing/washing his vehicle on the afternoon of 22 January 2010. Another witness, Roger Brown, saw him at around 11.30pm that evening. A friend of the deceased, Melissa Edwards, spoke to him by telephone at 9.00pm on 22 January 2010. A text message was received by Ms Edwards from the deceased when she checked her telephone on waking up on 23 January 2010. That message had been sent to her at about 1.30am on that day.
	
	
	Sometime after 12.30am on 23 January 2010 a meeting took place between the offender, Walsh and the deceased at Beaton Park, Wollongong. That meeting had been arranged between the offender and the deceased. The offender arrived in her own vehicle with a friend, Stacy Callaghan (“Callaghan”). The deceased attended in his own vehicle. Walsh arrived in Wells’ vehicle, after the offender and the deceased.
	
	
	At the meeting the deceased was detained by Walsh without his consent, in the company of the offender, for the purpose of obtaining further information regarding the burglary at the offender’s home. The deceased was detained in the vehicle driven by Walsh. Both Walsh and the offender made their way back to the Dapto premises in separate vehicles. On the offender’s arrival at those premises, Wells opened the garage door at the offender’s request. The offender told Wells that Walsh had the deceased in the car with him. A short time later Walsh arrived at the premises and drove the vehicle in which the deceased was detained into the garage. Walsh then entered the premises through an internal door leading from the garage. He told Wells that he “had Digby in the car”.
	
	
	The offender, Walsh and Wells then smoked some Ice, after which Walsh went back down stairs to the garage, saying that he was going to “speak to Matt and try and find out what he knows and where the things are …”. Walsh returned later and said to both Wells and the offender that the deceased “confessed all our stuff is in Nelly’s (Nelson’s) backyard…”. Walsh then said that he was going to take a drink down to the deceased and let him “stretch his legs”. Around this time, the offender left the Dapto premises, having been there for about an hour.
	


The deceased’s murder


	
	When Walsh went to go downstairs to the garage, Wells locked the internal door between the stairs leading down to the garage and the house. She returned to her bedroom and then heard noise coming from the garage. Walsh was calling out to her to let him back in the house. When she opened the door Walsh said to her:
	


“The fuckin’ cunt got himself untied and he nearly got me”.


	
	The deceased was murdered by the act of Walsh whilst the two of them were in the garage at that time. The offender was not physically present at the premises when the deceased was murdered. When he came back into the house Walsh pushed past Wells, stripped off his clothes and got into the shower. He later put his clothes and sneakers into a garbage bag which he tied up.
	
	
	A small swab taken from the floor of the garage of Wells’ premises was identified as blood, the DNA profile of which was consistent with that of the deceased.
	
	
	There were 18 phone calls/text messages between the offender and the deceased between about 1.45pm on Wednesday 20 January 2010 (when the necklace was redeemed) and 2.46am on Saturday 23 January 2010 (which was about the time of the meeting at Beaton Park). A recorded message from the offender to the deceased at 2.46am on 23 January 2010 was the last occasion on which the deceased’s mobile telephone was used. It was also the last time that the offender attempted to contact the deceased’s telephone. The deceased’s telephone was never recovered.
	


The offender’s actions as an accessory after the fact to the deceased’s murder


	
	The offender returned to the Dapto premises to find Walsh and Wells arguing. It was at that point that she became aware of the death of the deceased. Walsh told Wells, in the presence of the offender, to move Digby’s car:
	


“… so that if anybody was looking for Matt that knew that they were meeting there, (they) would think that he’d just left his car”.


	
	Before the offender and Wells left the Dapto premises Walsh told Wells to disguise herself with a hat, and to wear gloves. She had no gloves, and accordingly used socks.
	
	
	The offender drove Wells to Beaton Park and pointed out the deceased’s vehicle. Wells then drove the deceased’s vehicle, following the offender, to Murphys Avenue, Keiraville where the vehicle was left (and where it was later found abandoned). Wells and the offender then went in the offender’s car to Agdiran’s premises where the offender remained. Wells then returned home to Walsh.
	
	
	The following morning the offender travelled to the Dapto premises. She found Walsh and Wells arguing. She took Walsh away in her vehicle along with another person and dropped him back later that day.
	
	
	Walsh asked Wells to obtain some “rubber masks” which were to be used when disposing of the deceased’s body. That request was, in turn, communicated to the offender. That evening, Wells adhered to a plan to go bowling with her children. Afterwards she met up with the offender, following which they drove down to Kiama to a bus depot where the offender obtained two face masks from a friend named Gerard. The offender falsely told Gerard that she intended to teach Wells how to cut sandstone, the suggestion being that the masks were to be used for that purpose.
	
	
	The offender and Wells then returned to Wells’ premises. Walsh told them to go to Wollongong Hospital and obtain some syringes, and to make sure that they were seen on security cameras. During that time, Walsh was to take Wells’ car and dispose of it by burning it. There was a discussion about Walsh needing Wells to collect him from Macquarie Pass once he had set fire to the car and it was ultimately agreed that the offender would arrange a car for Wells to do so.
	
	
	Wells and the offender went to the hospital as directed. When they returned, Walsh had already left in Wells’ vehicle. Walsh rang Wells and gave her directions about where to collect him. The offender allowed Wells to use her (i.e. the offender’s) vehicle to do so.
	
	
	In the early hours of 25 January 2010, Walsh had taken Wells’ vehicle, with the deceased’s body in it, to Mount Murray where he set the vehicle alight. Wells drove to Macquarie Pass and collected Walsh, who had blood on his legs from leeches. The offender asked Wells to bring her car directly back. However, Wells first took Walsh to the Dapto premises where he immediately took off his clothes and put them, and mobile phones, into a backpack. He told Wells to take the backpack with her and directed that it be burned. When Wells took the offender’s car back to her, she informed the offender of the need to burn the backpack.
	
	
	The offender then contacted her ex-boyfriend, Mick Pearman (“Pearman”). When Pearman arrived at her premises, the offender told him that she needed a favour, and she asked Pearman to burn the backpack. When Pearman asked the offender about its contents, the offender responded:
	


“Please don’t ask questions Mick, just can you do it for me there’s one thing I need you to do, and that’s that”.


	
	Wells complained to the offender about not having a car because of the fact that hers had been burnt. The offender then hired a car from Budget Rent-a-Car at Wollongong. She paid for the car using a credit card and, once hired, the car was used by Wells.
	


The discovery of the deceased’s body


	
	Shortly before 7.00am on Monday 25 January 2010 railway employees reported a vehicle on fire on a track off Mount Murray Road, Mount Murray. The matter was reported and Fire Brigade personnel arrived and found a Mazda 626 station wagon ablaze. After the fire was extinguished the deceased’s body was found, chained to the front passenger seat of the vehicle. Apart from the chains securing the deceased’s body to the seat of the vehicle, there was also a chain around his throat. His body was badly burned, to the point of being unrecognisable. A forensic dentist subsequently identified the body as being that of the deceased.
	
	
	Although an examination of the deceased’s remains was carried out, the cause of his death could not be determined due to the extent to which those remains had been burned.
	


The police interview with Wells


	
	At about midday on 25 January 2010 Wells reported her vehicle stolen. This was about 5 hours after the vehicle had been reported to be on fire. She was interviewed later that day by police. She told police that she last saw her vehicle at 8.00pm on Sunday 24 January 2010. She said that she had taken her three daughters bowling that night, and that when she returned to the car it refused to start. She said that she and her children walked to the offender’s house (about a 10 to 15 minute walk) and that the offender later drove them home. She said that when she got home, Walsh was asleep, and so she and the offender drove to Wollongong Hospital to obtain some syringes. She said that they then drove to the offender’s place where she was dropped off.
	
	
	Wells later gave a different account of events in an induced statement.
	


The police interview with the offender


	
	On 27 January 2010 the offender was interviewed by police. She corroborated the false account given by Wells. She also confirmed the report of the burglary at her premises on 14 January 2010.
	
	
	The offender admitted that she had been with the deceased when he redeemed the necklace from the Pawn Shop, and confirmed that she had contacted the deceased about her stolen property after seeing his name on the pledge docket. She said that a few days after the deceased had redeemed the necklace, she arranged to meet with him at Beaton Park regarding the return of more of her property. She claimed that the deceased had offered her an X-Box gaming console which she declined to take. During this conversation the offender denied any involvement in, or any knowledge of, the kidnapping and murder of the deceased.
	


Contact between the offender, Walsh and Wells


	
	Between 22 January 2010 and 7.00am on 25 January 2010 (the latter being the time at which the deceased’s body was discovered) there were over one hundred calls/text messages between phones being used by the offender, Walsh and Wells. After that, these phones were never used again (other than one call being made from the offender’s phone around 10.00am on 25 January 2010).
	


Contact between the offender and Pearman


	
	During the period between 14 January 2010 and 25 January 2010 the offender was going through the break-up of her relationship with Pearman who was frequently calling her and sending text messages. Pearman was originally arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased, however those charges were later withdrawn due to a lack of evidence. When arrested, a cellebrite was obtained from Pearman’s phone. Text messages passing between the offender and Pearman on 25 January 2010 (after the deceased’s body had been burned) demonstrate that the offender had taken a great deal of time to detail her car (which had been used by Wells to collect Walsh from Mount Murray) and that she was feeling unwell and emotional. In particular, the offender sent a message to Pearman apologising for involving him and thanking him for his help. That message included the following:
	


“I’m really sorry I got you involved but I do thank you very much for helping me. I would be fucked if you didn’t and will never forget what you did for me…”.

The arrest of the offender and Walsh


	
	On 23 February 2010 police arrested Walsh at the Dapto premises. He was taken to Port Kembla Police Station.
	
	
	The offender was arrested on the same day and was taken to Wollongong Police Station. Each exercised the right to silence when questioned by the police.
	


THE OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENDING

Submissions of the Crown


	
	In submitting that the offending in each of Counts 1 and 2 was of “very serious gravity”, the Crown commenced by referring to the fact that the offending arose out of the actions of the offender in undertaking her own investigation of the burglary of her premises. This, it was submitted, constituted a form of vigilante action on the part of the offender, and provided some relevant background to what followed.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was relevant, in assessing the objective seriousness of the offending in Count 1, that the offender:
	



	
	arranged the meeting with the deceased at Beaton Park;
	
	
	was present at Beaton Park, with Walsh, for the purposes of detaining the deceased;
	
	
	travelled from Beaton Park back to the Dapto premises, essentially at the same time as Walsh was transporting the deceased back to that address;
	
	
	facilitated Walsh’s entry into the garage of the Dapto premises; and
	
	
	was present in the premises, for a significant period, whilst the deceased was detained downstairs in the garage.
	



	
	The Crown submitted that the offender’s presence during the period of detention was significant, and extended from the point of time at which the deceased was detained at Beaton Park, up to the time that the offender left the Dapto premises. It was submitted that such period encompassed at least one hour.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that I should find that the accused knew of the form of restraint which was applied to the deceased, and which involved chains being wound around his body. In advancing that submission, the Crown conceded that the agreed facts did not assert that the offender saw the deceased when he was detained in the garage, and did not assert the precise time at which the chains were applied to him. Indeed, the Crown conceded that there was no direct evidence at all of the offender’s knowledge of the form of restraint which was applied. However the Crown submitted that in circumstances where:
	



	
	no other form of restraint had been identified on the evidence;
	
	
	the offender had been present at the time of the commencement of the deceased’s detention at Beaton Park; and
	
	
	the offender had been present for a substantial period thereafter during which the deceased was detained,
	


there was an available inference that the chains had been applied to restrain the deceased throughout that time. These circumstances, it was submitted, supported the conclusion that the offender was aware of the application of the chains as a form of restraint. I should note that whether there is, as the Crown submitted, “an available inference” is not the issue. The issue is whether or not the inference urged by the Crown is the only available inference, so as to satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was aware of the form of restraint which was applied.


	
	The Crown then turned to the offending in Count 2. It was submitted that the conduct of the offender in respect of that count included:
	



	
	returning to the Dapto premises on the morning following the deceased’s detention, taking Walsh away in her vehicle and then returning him to the premises later that day;
	
	
	driving Wells to Beaton Park in order to facilitate the removal of the deceased’s vehicle from that area;
	
	
	travelling to Kiama to collect face masks;
	
	
	travelling with Wells to the hospital to set up an alibi;
	
	
	permitting Wells to use her car for the purposes of collecting Walsh from Mt Murray;
	
	
	arranging for Pearman to dispose of the backpack, in circumstances where the offender must have known that the backpack contained items which were potentially incriminating; and
	
	
	cleaning her own car after it was used by Wells to collect Walsh after he burnt Wells’ vehicle and incinerated the body of the deceased.
	



	
	All of these matters, the Crown submitted, supported a conclusion that the offender knowingly participated in a plan to incinerate the deceased’s body.
	
	
	The Crown relied, in particular, upon the degree of contact between the offender, Walsh and Wells (as set out in [46] above) as being indicative of the involvement of the offender. It was further submitted that the offending in Count 2 had been motivated by the offending in Count 1, and was aggravated by the offender’s criminal association with Walsh. It was further submitted that the offender’s conduct as outlined in [54] above had successfully thwarted the police investigation for a period of approximately one month.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that this was not a case where the offender’s conduct was a spontaneous reaction to a critical or unexpected situation, nor was it a case where her conduct was isolated or restricted. Rather, the Crown submitted, it was a case where the offending extended over a period of time, and manifested itself in a variety of different acts.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that although the offender may not have known that the deceased was to be incinerated, the evidence established that she knew that she was assisting in a plan which would involve the disposal of his body in some way. Whilst the Crown accepted that this reflected a lesser degree of criminality than that seen in instances where an accessory directly engages, or assists, in the actual act of disposal, it was submitted that the offender’s conduct, when viewed as a whole, supported a conclusion that the objective seriousness of the offending in Count 2 fell towards the upper range. It was submitted that such conduct reflected the offender’s deep and intense involvement in a plan directed to avoiding detention.
	
	
	Finally, whilst accepting that the offender was not directly responsible for the incineration of the deceased, the Crown pointed specifically to the evidence of her acquisition of the face masks. It was submitted that in the circumstances of the present case, such items were consistent only with being used in association with moving and/or disposing of the deceased’s body.
	


Submissions of the Offender


	
	Senior counsel for the offender submitted that there was no evidence that the offender had participated in a plan knowing that it was proposed that the deceased’s body would be incinerated. To the extent that the Crown relied upon the offender’s actions in acquiring the face masks, it was submitted that from the offender’s perspective, the act of simply moving the deceased’s body may have necessitated the use of a mask. Senior counsel for the offender pointed out that there was nothing in the agreed facts which demonstrated that the offender knew what was to happen to the deceased’s body.
	
	
	In terms of the telephone contact between the offender, Walsh and Wells which was relied upon by the Crown, senior counsel submitted that there was insufficient evidence to support a conclusion, beyond reasonable doubt, that each and every one of the calls or messages related to the offending. That said, senior counsel did not cavil with the proposition that the evidence sustained an inference that at least some of those calls were related.
	
	
	Senior counsel accepted that the association between the offender and Walsh was relevant in an assessment of the offender’s objective criminality. However, he stressed that the plea to Count 1 had been entered on the basis (reflected in the agreed facts) that the offender did not anticipate any harm being occasioned to the deceased.
	
	
	Senior counsel further submitted that the evidence supported a conclusion that the offending in respect of Count 2 originated from a misguided sense of loyalty on the part of the offender towards Walsh. It was submitted that such a conclusion was supported by the evidence of the offender’s emotional state.
	
	
	Finally, senior counsel accepted that the genesis of the offending was what the Crown had described as the “vigilante” action on the part of the offender in originally going to the deceased’s premises. However, he cautioned against a finding that the offender was a “principal” in any criminal association, and stressed that it was necessary, in assessing the offender’s objective criminality, to concentrate upon what she in fact did.
	


Consideration


	
	I turn firstly to the offending in Count 1.
	
	
	In R v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 183 Howie J observed (at [32]) that the gravamen of this offence, for the purposes of sentencing, is the unlawful detaining of a person. His Honour went on to say that amongst the factors relevant to a determination of the seriousness of the offence were the period, circumstances and purpose of the detention, as well as the identity of the person being detained.
	
	
	In the present case, the period of detention to which the offender was a party was a relatively short one, extending over a period of approximately one hour. The circumstances and purpose of the detention, and the person detained, are related considerations. I am satisfied that the offender arranged the meeting at Beaton Park and detained the deceased for the purposes of trying to obtain information about the burglary of her premises. However, I am not satisfied that the offender was aware of the precise form of restraint which was utilised. Even accepting that only one form of restraint has been identified, and accepting further that the offender was at Beaton Park when the detention commenced, there is no evidence at all as to when the chains were applied to the deceased’s body. I also bear in mind that there is no evidence that the offender contemplated that any physical harm would be inflicted upon the deceased.
	
	
	The genesis of the offending in Count 1 was the offender’s mistaken belief that the deceased was responsible for the burglary at her premises. Having notified the police of the burglary, the offender could have simply allowed them to investigate the matter. Instead, she opted to take the law into her own hands by arranging a meeting with the deceased, and then detaining him for the purposes of eliciting information from him.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, the offending in Count 1 must be regarded as being of a serious kind.
	
	
	In respect of Count 2, it must be firstly observed that the offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder can occur in a wide range of circumstances. There is, as a consequence, a wide variation in the degrees of moral culpability displayed by persons who are convicted of that offence: R v Urriola [2010] NSWSC 367.
	
	
	In R v Johnson [2014] NSWSC 1254 Hamill J observed (at [13]) that an assessment of the objective gravity of an offence of this kind involves a consideration of a number of factors which include:
	


(1) the circumstances of the murder itself;

(2) the extent of the knowledge of the accessory of those circumstances;

(3) the precise act(s) constituting the offence;

(4) the length of time over which the offender assisted the principal offender in escaping justice;

(5) the extent to which the acts of the offender successfully delayed, or thwarted, the investigation and prosecution of the principal offender;

(6) the motivation of the offender in committing the crime; and

(7) whether the offender’s conduct was motivated by a sense of misguided loyalty or emotional attachment to the principal offender.


	
	His Honour also observed that it had generally been held that offences involving the disposal or destruction of a corpse are cases which fall at the upper range of criminality.
	
	
	In the present case, little is known, at least in precise terms, of the circumstances in which the deceased was murdered. The agreed facts say nothing more than that the deceased was killed by Walsh when the two of them were in the garage of the Dapto premises. The cause of death is not known. The offender was not present when the deceased was murdered. She obviously learned of the deceased’s death at some later time, although there is no evidence that she learned of the precise circumstances in which he was killed.
	
	
	Having learned of the deceased’s death, the offender engaged in a series of separate and distinct acts, committed over a period of some days, which were directed towards ensuring that the deceased’s death would not be discovered. Those acts were many and varied. They extended to engaging another party, namely Pearman, to dispose of evidence which was potentially incriminating.
	
	
	In terms of an assessment of the offender’s objective criminality in respect of the offending in Count 2, three particular issues arise.
	
	
	The first of those issues, and perhaps the most important, is whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender’s acts were carried out in the knowledge that the deceased’s body would be incinerated. There is no dispute that the offender was responsible for acquiring the face masks. It is also clear from the agreed facts that when she acquired them, she lied as to their intended purpose. Given these circumstances, and viewing her conduct as a whole, I am satisfied that the offender acted as she did in the knowledge that she was part of plan to dispose of the deceased’s body in some way or another. However I am not satisfied that she was aware of the precise method of disposition. Moreover, the offender did not play a direct role in that disposition, although that is not a factor which operates, of itself, to lessen the seriousness of the offending. Each case must be determined on its own facts: Kaminic v R [2014] NSWCCA 116 at [45].
	
	
	The second issue concerns the telephone contact between the offender, Wells and Walsh upon which the Crown relied as evidence of the extent of the offender’s participation in the plan. I am not satisfied that the entirety of that contact was related to the offending in Count 2, although as senior counsel for the offender conceded, some of it obviously was. In any event, there is, as I have outlined, a considerable amount of other evidence which demonstrates that the offender’s participation was extensive. In this regard, I accept the Crown’s submission that this was not a case of the offender having engaged in spontaneous, isolated or restricted conduct. On the contrary, her conduct was wide ranging, and was committed over a period of time.
	
	
	The third issue concerns the offender’s motivation to become involved in the offending in Count 2. The offender did not give evidence before me and accordingly, any conclusion I reach in respect of this issue is necessarily one based upon such inferences as can be drawn from the evidence. The offender and Walsh were clearly closely acquainted. Indeed, the offender had engaged Walsh to assist her in visiting the offender’s premises in the first instance. Given their background, I am satisfied that the offender’s actions were motivated by what she saw as a need to be loyal to Walsh. At the same time, it must be emphasised that irrespective of her motivation, the offender knowingly participated in a plan to dispose of the deceased’s body in order to protect Walsh. Her participation was, as I have outlined, extensive. Moreover, even if an offence of this nature is committed out of a sense of misguided loyalty, it does not follow as a matter of course that the sentence imposed will be lenient: R v Ward [2004] NSWSC 420 at [49]-[51].
	
	
	Like the offending in Count 1, that in respect of Count 2 is also most serious. However, in circumstances where the offender played no direct role in the actual disposition of the deceased’s body, and in circumstances where I have concluded that she was not aware, in precise terms, of the method of disposition, I am unable to accept the Crown’s submission that the offending in Count 2 falls towards the upper end of the range.
	


THE OFFENDER’S SUBJECTIVE CASE

The evidence


	
	A large amount of documentary material was tendered in the offender’s case on sentence, with the consent of the Crown. That material may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	In October 2012, prior to the previous sentence proceedings, the offender was examined by Dr Richard Furst, psychiatrist. On that occasion Dr Furst diagnosed the offender as suffering from a major depressive disorder, and a substance abuse disorder. He recommended psychological intervention, and expressed the view that the offender had good prospects of rehabilitation, provided she received adequate support. Notwithstanding the serious nature of the offending for which the offender was then being sentenced, Dr Furst took the view that any risk of future offending was low. The offences to which the offender has now pleaded guilty are, of course, substantially less serious than those upon which she was originally indicted.
	
	
	More recently, the offender was examined by Elizabeth Kramer, forensic psychologist. Ms Kramer described the offender as having reported experiencing “appropriate levels of contrition and victim empathy”. She also observed that the offender had made a “reasonable effort to rehabilitate herself since her detainment in custody”. The results of psychometric testing administered by Ms Kramer indicated that the offender continued to experience mental health symptoms.
	
	
	Ms Kramer concurred with the earlier diagnoses of Dr Furst. She also supported the implementation of a treatment plan directed to reducing the offender’s risk of recidivism. Ms Kramer expressed the view that if the offender did not participate in drug rehabilitation, the risk of relapse, and subsequent recidivism, was high.
	
	
	Ms Kramer also indicated that in order to address her substance abuse issues the offender would require intensive support over a period of more than 12 months. She expressed the view that the offender required long term counselling, and that a long period of community-based supervision would ensure that she adhered to treatment, and was accountable for her recovery and rehabilitation in the longer term.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the offender also tendered, with the consent of the Crown, a letter written by the offender and addressed to the parents of the deceased. In that letter, she expressed her remorse for her offending.
	
	
	Also tendered to the court was a letter from the offender’s mother. The letter referred to the fact that the offender is part of a close knit family, the members of which continue to support her. It is evident that the offender continues to enjoy the unqualified support of her mother. That support manifests itself in a number of ways, including ensuring that despite her incarceration, the offender continues to have regular contact with her two children. It is evident that the offender’s mother will continue to support her following her release from custody, in an effort to ensure that she can be successfully reintegrated into the community.
	
	
	Documents tendered from persons who have had contact with the offender in custody speak positively of her efforts towards rehabilitation. Margaret Wiseman, a Prison Chaplain who had provided a testimonial for the offender at the time of the previous sentence proceedings, provided a further testimonial in which she stated that in the intervening period the offender had been “consistent in adhering to her desire to be a good woman”. Ms Wiseman, who has regular contact with the offender, observed that she had worked hard in her employment within the prison and had gained a reputation for dependability. Ms Wiseman confirmed, from her own observations, the support given to the offender by her mother.
	
	
	Other documents tendered in the offender’s case confirm that from the point of view of her rehabilitation, she has used her time in custody productively. She has achieved levels of competency in respect of a number of different courses and has been employed consistently since 2012. Assessments of her work performance attest to her efficiency, her ability to effectively communicate with others, her social skills and her enthusiasm for her work. As recently as September of this year, her immediate supervisor made reference to the fact that the offender has endeavoured to achieve her full potential in undertaking her work.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown accepted that the offender was entitled to a discount for the utilitarian value of her pleas. However, the Crown submitted that the pleas did not represent contrition or remorse due to the late stage at which they had been entered, such that any discount would necessarily fall at the lowest end of the scale.
	
	
	In terms of the offender’s expressions of remorse in the letter written to the deceased’s family, the Crown did not go so far as to submit that I should find that such expressions were not genuine, nor did the Crown submit that those expressions were entirely irrelevant as a mitigating factor. However, the Crown submitted that their effect was necessarily limited due to the late stage at which they were made.
	
	
	In terms of the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation, the Crown accepted that it would be open to me to find, on the whole of the evidence, that such prospects were good. That said, the Crown emphasised that having regard to the report of Ms Kramer, it was evident the offender continued to encounter difficulties in respect of substance abuse, and that her prospects of rehabilitation in that respect ultimately depended upon her willingness to undertake, and adhere to, an appropriate course of treatment.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that whilst it remained a matter for my discretion, there should, in the circumstances, be substantial accumulation of the sentences imposed for each of the offences. It was submitted that in large measure, the criminality of the offender in each individual count was separate and distinct from the other.
	
	
	Finally, in respect of a finding of special circumstances, the Crown submitted that whatever view was reached as to an appropriate sentence it would necessarily be the case that a lengthy period of parole would be imposed. It was submitted that in all of these circumstances, such period would be sufficient to address issues surrounding the offender’s rehabilitation and that in these circumstances, a finding of special circumstances should not be made.
	


Submissions of the offender


	
	Senior counsel for the offender accepted that the offender’s expressions of remorse were late. However notwithstanding this, he described those expressions as “healthy” and submitted that they were, at the very least, supportive of a conclusion that the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation were generally positive. Senior counsel submitted that such a conclusion was generally supported by the evidence which established that the offender had made productive use of her time in custody.
	
	
	Senior counsel relied on similar considerations in support of a submission that I should make a finding of special circumstances. He pointed, in particular, to the fact that the offender has responded positively and productively to her period in custody thus far. He submitted that a lengthy period of parole was in the interests of both the offender, and the community at large.
	
	
	Finally, in terms of the offender’s pleas of guilty, senior counsel acknowledged that any discount would necessarily fall towards the lower end of the scale. At the same time, he submitted that the offender ought not be “punished” by having gone to trial, having succeeded in the Court of Criminal Appeal, and having then entered pleas of guilty to charges of less gravity. Senior counsel also submitted that it was relevant, in assessing the level of discount for the plea, to take into account the fact that the offender had pleaded to the offending in Count 2 at what I should regard as having been the first available opportunity.
	


Consideration


	
	I turn firstly to the offender’s pleas of guilty. Clearly, the timing of such pleas is relevant to a determination of the discount to be applied to reflect their utilitarian value: R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [154] per Spigelman CJ. In the present case, the pleas have obviously been entered at a very late stage.
	
	
	I accept the submission of senior counsel that the offender is not to be “punished” in light of the history of the proceedings. However, whilst the charges to which the offender has now pleaded guilty are not those in respect of which she was originally indicted, I am unable to accept the submission that her pleas to those charges should be treated as having been entered at the first available opportunity. Such a submission is contrary to authority: see R v PB [2008] NSWCCA 109; (2008) 184 A Crim R 552 at [30] per Bell JA (as her Honour then was) (Johnson and McCallum JJ agreeing); R v NP [2003] NSWCCA 195 at [25] per Hodgson JA (Simpson and Greg James JJ agreeing; R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 at [5]-[6] per Hodgson JA (Barr J agreeing). In all of the circumstances the appropriate discount is 10%.
	
	
	The offender’s criminal history is constituted by three appearances in the Local Court for what might be regarded as minor drug offences, two in 2008 and one in 2011. That history is consistent with the evidence (contained, most recently, in the report of Ms Kramer) of the offender’s history of drug abuse. Importantly, the offender has no history of any offending similar to that for which she is to be sentenced on this occasion.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the offender’s expressions of remorse are genuine and I have taken them into account in determining sentence. However, as was properly conceded on the offender’s behalf, they have come at a very late stage, and this is a circumstance which necessarily lessens the weight which would otherwise have been given to them.
	
	
	On the whole of the evidence, I am satisfied that the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation are good. She clearly has some insight into her offending, and has used her time in custody productively. She also has the support of her family. However, I am not prepared to make a finding of special circumstances. The offender’s period on parole will be more than adequate to assist her rehabilitation and re-integration into the community. Moreover, the period will be generally in keeping with the views expressed by Ms Kramer as to that which is likely to be needed to properly address the offender’s rehabilitation.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	Because of the circumstances in which the offender has come to be sentenced for Counts 1 and 2, the “ceiling principle” applies. The operation of that principle was discussed at length by Bathurst CJ in Armstrong v Regina [2015] NSWCCA 273 commencing at [41]. I am mindful of that principle in sentencing the offender. Counts 1 and 2 each carry maximum penalties which are substantially less than those which applied to the offences for which the offender was originally sentenced.
	
	
	Both parties agreed that there should be some accumulation of the sentences imposed, although their respective positions differed as to its extent. In determining that question I have had regard to the principle of totality. Although the entirety of the offending arose, broadly speaking, from the one set of circumstances, the conduct in respect of each respective Count was quite different. In my view, this is not a case where the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other: R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115 at [52] per Hall J, Tobias JA and Kirby J agreeing. It follows that there must be significant accumulation.
	
	
	It is also necessary to bear in mind, particularly in respect of the offending in Count 2, that general deterrence is an important consideration: R v Serone [2012] NSWSC 1232.
	
	
	Finally, when previously sentencing the offender I set out (at [83]-[85] of my judgment) the offender’s periods of pre-sentence custody. Taking those periods into account I backdated the sentences I then imposed to commence on 22 October 2011. It has not been suggested that this approach was incorrect and accordingly, I propose to adopt it again.
	
	
	In respect of the offending in Count 1, the offender is convicted and sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 5 years, to commence on 22 October 2011 and to expire on 21 October 2016. I decline to impose a non-parole period.
	
	
	In respect of the offending in Count 2, the offender is convicted and sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months imprisonment commencing on 22 October 2013 and expiring on 21 February 2017, with a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months imprisonment commencing on 22 February 2017 and expiring on 21 April 2018.
	
	
	The offender will be eligible for parole on 21 February 2017 and her sentence will expire on 21 April 2018.

2768193,Glover v R; Stuart v R [2015] NSWCCA 285,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: Three co-accused, Bradley Carr, Laurence Glover and Nathan Stuart were put on trial on an indictment containing 12 counts. Their separate appeals were listed for hearing before this Court on 9 July 2015.
	
	
	Mr Carr appealed his convictions on eight counts on the basis of an alleged irregularity in the conduct of a juror and the failure of the trial judge to discharge the jury. That application for leave to appeal has been separately disposed of. [1] 
	
	
	Mr Stuart originally sought to challenge his convictions on counts 2–6 and 9–11. He did not seek to appeal the conviction on count 12. In oral submissions his counsel indicated that the application for leave to appeal was abandoned with respect to counts 9–11. Mr Stuart relied on two grounds of appeal. Ground 2 alleged that the convictions under challenge were unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence. His first ground should be set out in full:
	


“The trial judge erred in allowing the Crown to rely on coincidence evidence in that he:

a.   failed to evaluate the likelihood that the jury would be likely to assign the evidence significant probative value;

b.   concluded that he was ‘really required to take the evidence at its highest’ without considering whether there was a possible explanation inconsistent with guilt, as a real possibility, and whether that altered his view as to the significant probative value;

c.   failed to identify the unfair prejudice to the appellant; and/or

d.   failed to undertake the balancing exercise under s 101(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).”


	
	The wording of this particular ground revealed a degree of ambivalence as to the precise nature of the complaint. Each of the four particulars reflected elements of ss 98 and 101 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), addressing the circumstances in which coincidence evidence can be admitted. However, as the opening words of the ground revealed, this was not a challenge to a judgment on admissibility, but a challenge to the manner in which the prosecutor was allowed to “rely on” that which was identified as coincidence evidence. It will be necessary to explain the procedural steps which gave rise to the formulation of this ground.
	
	
	Mr Stuart also sought leave to appeal with respect to the sentence imposed for the offences for which he was convicted, being an aggregate term of 16 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years. As it could not be known until his conviction appeal was disposed of whether he would need to be resentenced or whether the aggregate sentence imposed by the trial judge would stand, the application for leave to appeal against sentence was stood over to be dealt with after judgment in relation to his conviction appeal. For the reasons given below, Mr Stuart also should be granted leave to appeal but his appeal against the convictions identified above should be dismissed. The application for leave to appeal against sentence must be relisted.
	
	
	Mr Glover appealed seven of nine convictions: he did not appeal the convictions on counts 11 and 12 in the indictment. He did however appeal from the convictions on counts 2–6, 9 and 10 on the single ground that they were “unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence”. Because such a ground is not limited to a question of law alone, he requires leave. [2]  For reasons given below, there should be a grant of leave and the appeal upheld as to counts 2, 3 and 4, but otherwise dismissed. This requires that Mr Glover be resentenced. He should have the opportunity to put further submissions on this issue, which will be considered at the same time as Mr Stuart’s sentence appeal.
	


Background to the charges


	
	In order to consider the grounds of appeal sought to be raised by each applicant, it is necessary to explain briefly the content of each charge and the factual circumstances which gave rise to it. Not all co-accused were charged with each offence.
	
	
	Count 1 alleged the theft of a black Audi RS4 Avant station wagon MS 2530, which, together with the car keys, was stolen from the home of its owner on the night of 3 May 2011. Carr and Stuart (but not Glover) were charged with that offence, but were acquitted. There followed three robberies at hotels in the eastern suburbs of Sydney between 4 May and 7 June 2011. The prosecution alleged that the black Audi was used as a getaway car in each case. All three accused were charged in relation to each offence, the prosecution case being that Mr Carr drove the motor vehicle and Messrs Stuart and Glover entered the respective hotels.
	
	
	The first robbery (counts 2 and 3) occurred at the Nelson Hotel on Oxford Street, Bondi Junction, shortly after 10pm on the evening of 4 May 2011. The two offences resulted from separate acts of robbery involving the deputy manager of the hotel, from whom an amount of some $10,000 was taken, and a bar attendant, from whom the contents of the bar till were taken, being a little under $4,000. In submissions, the two counts were referred to as the first robbery.
	
	
	The second robbery (count 4) took place on the same evening at about 10.30pm at the Sands Hotel, Maroubra. An amount of $12,800 was taken from the general manager, who had been counting the daily tills at the time one of the offenders kicked in her office door.
	
	
	The third and fourth robberies occurred some five weeks later, on 7 June 2011. The third robbery (count 5) involved the Rose of Australia Hotel at Erskineville. Two offenders entered the hotel at about 10.50pm and escaped with a small amount of money from a till (about $1,250). Some 15 minutes later, offenders robbed the Excelsior Hotel at Surry Hills, taking approximately $7,688 (count 6). Police were alerted to the robbery as it was taking place and drove in front of the Audi which was parked outside the hotel. In seeking to escape, the Audi was driven into the police vehicle, mounting the pavement and, as described Constable Scrymgour, the Audi “climbed up and over the bonnet of the police vehicle” before driving off. Police recovered a screwdriver which had been used by the offenders.
	
	
	Prior to the robberies on 7 June, the black Audi with its correct number plates, MS 2530, had been observed in a secure underground car park in Cowper Street, Randwick. On 8 June 2011 a police officer inspected the vehicle, which then bore number plates AWC 07T.
	
	
	On 10 June 2011, shortly after 9.00am, Mr Carr visited the police website on which there were details of the robberies at the Rose of Australia and Excelsior Hotels. On the morning of 27 June 2011, he again visited the website and accessed a media release relating to an armed robbery in Randwick. Shortly after midnight (on 28 June), the black Audi was taken from the car park in Cowper Street, driven to a nearby lane and set alight. Mr Carr was charged with destroying the Audi motor vehicle (count 7). Another person was also said to have been involved in the torching of the motor vehicle; neither Glover nor Stuart was charged with that offence.
	
	
	On 4 July 2011 there was a break-in at a house in South Coogee, car keys were stolen from the house and the motor vehicle, another Audi, registration number BLE 66F, was stolen. Messrs Carr and Stuart were charged with breaking and entering the house and stealing the keys and the vehicle (count 8). Both were acquitted, but the stolen vehicle was involved in subsequent offences with which the three accused were charged.
	
	
	A fifth robbery occurred on Monday, 18 July 2011 at the Malabar RSL. Shortly after the club opened (at about 11.30am) two men, alleged to be Glover and Stuart, entered the premises and required staff of the club to open a safe and an ATM from which approximately $94,550 was taken (count 9). A different staff member was required to empty money from a till: approximately $6,420 was taken (count 10). There was significant evidence linking Mr Stuart in particular to the robbery. That included CCTV footage taken two days earlier which revealed a number of people, including Mr Stuart, at the club and signing the visitor’s book, which he did in his own name.
	
	
	Mr Stuart returned to the Malabar RSL on 5 September 2011, again signing in in his own name. At about 7.58am on Wednesday, 7 September 2011, two offenders entered the club, a third offender remaining outside in a stolen high performance Mercedes sports car, without registration plates. The two men who entered the club were wearing hooded jumpers and triangular handkerchiefs tied over their faces, but no balaclavas. No money was taken: the offence (count 11) was identified as attempted armed robbery with a dangerous weapon. Bradley Carr had been arrested on 12 August 2011 and remained in custody on 7 September. Messrs Glover and Stuart were charged in relation to this offence.
	
	
	The final offence (count 12) occurred on 12 September 2011 when two men wearing hooded jumpers and masks entered the Regent Hotel, Kingsford shortly after 10am. An amount of some $59,000 was taken. A witness observed the men leaving the Hotel, both wearing hoods, one clutching a bag and the other an iron bar. They ran to a Mercedes sports car which drove them away. The witness took a note of the front number plate, AP 234, and called the police. Messrs Glover and Stuart were charged with this offence.
	
	
	Various arrests and searches were made on 12 September 2011. A search warrant was executed at Stuart’s home in Pitt Street, Waterloo. Police located $5,000 in cash, a pair of red and black gloves, a key to a stolen Mercedes BNN 77U and a pair of Adidas black track suit pants with three white stripes down the leg. The cash was found in bundles held with elastic bands, said to be consistent with money taken from the Regent Hotel. Mr Stuart was arrested and interviewed at Redfern police station. He was charged with the Regent Hotel robbery. In formal admissions dated 5 June 2013 he admitted stealing the Mercedes BNN 77U.
	
	
	Mr Glover was arrested at about the same time leaving premises on Gardeners Road, Kingsford, leased by his girlfriend, Dayna Jennings. He had $1,850 in his wallet and a key to his own motor vehicle, which was located at 43 Dacre Street, Malabar. The unit occupied by Ms Jennings at Gardeners Road was searched; the garage to the unit was also searched, revealing the stolen black Mercedes BNN 77U, displaying stolen plates AP 234. A pair of pink washing-up gloves which contained DNA consistent with that of Mr Glover was found in the vehicle. Similar DNA was found on an interior door handle in the Mercedes. A small black crow bar was located on the passenger side front floor. In addition, number plates from the stolen Audi BLE 66F were also located in the Mercedes.
	
	
	The third man alleged to have been involved in the robbery of the Regent Hotel was Kane Hoskin. At 11.50pm on 12 September 2011, police attended at the Matraville home of Hoskin’s girlfriend, Siobhan Kelly. Hoskin was asleep in her bedroom, but was woken and arrested. Police asked if there was cash on the premises and were told there was no large amount present. After his arrest, the bedroom was searched and $18,100 was located in a gift box in the wardrobe, together with an additional $1,500 in a brown bag hanging from the bedpost.
	
	
	There was no doubt that each of the offences identified in the 12 counts occurred: the primary issue at the trial of the applicants was whether the prosecution was able to establish beyond reasonable doubt that each of them was involved in each of the offences as charged. The prosecution case relied on eyewitness descriptions of the persons involved in the robberies, together with objective information, including that recovered as a result of various searches. Importantly and in addition, the prosecution relied upon common elements, said to reveal a modus operandi, but also use of particular weapons, motor vehicles and items of disguise. As the applicants accepted, there was substantial evidence identifying them with the Regent Hotel (count 12), being the last robbery in the sequence and being followed almost immediately by the arrests and searches of various premises, which revealed incriminating evidence. The prosecution case was that, having identified the offenders in a particular robbery or robberies, the common elements with other robberies could be used to link the same offenders with the other robberies.
	
	
	The defence case sought to counter the elements of commonality. There was significant evidence from police witnesses regarding a major investigation of a spate of robberies of clubs and hotels. The officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Harris, gave evidence that substantial resources were devoted to telephone intercepts, surveillance of various locations and obtaining evidence from “160-odd witnesses”. [3]  Detective Harris agreed that a strike force had been established in mid-March 2011 following a spate of robberies, including one at the Rose Shamrock and Thistle Hotel in Rozelle. One of the offenders was described as a male “wearing a black Adidas hooded jumper with three white stripes running down the sleeves and an Adidas motif on the front,” carrying “a small silver handgun” and wearing gloves and a balaclava. Detective Harris said that police believed there was a connection between that and two other robberies and some of those the subject of the present charges, but also agreed that Laurence Glover was not a suspect in respect of the other offences. [4] 
	
	
	Detective Harris, was also questioned about a robbery at the Mercure Hotel at Wolli Creek on 14 February 2011. He was aware of the robbery and agreed that one of the offenders had been reported to be wearing “pink gloves”. [5]  A particular common element in some of the present offences was that one of the robbers had worn pink (or red) washing-up gloves. The purpose was not to link the accused with that additional robbery, but to suggest that this was a robbery involving other offenders, using similar gloves. (The cross-examination did not take that matter far, because Detective Harris did not know who was suspected of involvement.)
	
	
	A second officer, Detective Jouni was cross-examined to establish that the black Audi MS 2530 had been used in an aggravated break and enter in which the principal offender was believed to be one Jack Dunne, and not any of the accused.
	
	
	These examples illustrate the main thrust of the defence case, which was to raise a reasonable doubt as to the elements of commonality, in part based upon variations in descriptions given by eyewitnesses and in part based on the fact that common elements, such as the use of pink (or red) kitchen gloves, might be a common feature of such offences and thus not indicative that the same individuals were involved in two offences where pink or red kitchen gloves were used. By the same reasoning, proof that a particular vehicle had been used by a different person in relation to another offence cast doubt upon the strength of the inference to be derived from the fact that the vehicle was used in each of a number of robberies with which the accused were charged.
	
	
	Against this background, it is necessary to consider in more detail the nature of the prosecution case and the extent to which it relied upon coincidence evidence, in order to determine whether it was sufficient, with respect to each offence, to support the resulting conviction.
	


Reliance on coincidence evidence


	
	Mr Stuart (though not Mr Glover) challenged the use of coincidence evidence by the prosecution. The way in which the issue arose for determination at the trial was, one hopes, unusual; on its face, it was somewhat bizarre. Following the arraignment of the three accused on 14 counts, there was a debate as to the admissibility of coincidence evidence, based on a notice given by the prosecution, although not initially made available in this Court. It appears that counsel for Mr Glover sought to sever counts 9 and 10 and counsel for Mr Stuart sought to sever count 9. (That was done.) The position of Mr Carr is not critical in this argument, except that the manner in which his counsel sought to argue the application on his behalf had some resonance in the way the appeal was pursued in this Court by Stuart and Glover. Thus counsel for Mr Carr submitted at trial: [6] 
	


“As I understand it, in addition to circumstantial evidence that might be relevant and admissible in relation to linking any specific case to another specific case, for example, it’s the Crown case that the one car was used in the first four, and to the extent that there may be evidence that supports that from bystanders, then that wouldn’t be tendency and coincidence per se, but it would be something that your Honour should consider when your Honour considers whether there is in fact evidence – significant probative value under s 98 or 97 and whether the 101 test succeeds.”


	
	In this Court (albeit in a less confused manner) counsel for the respondent Director sought to support the conduct of the trial, involving three co-accused and, ultimately 12 separate counts, on the basis that it was, in effect, a case based on circumstantial evidence. He referred to the reasoning of the High Court in Harriman v The Queen. [7]  That case involved a charge against the accused of being knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin in April 1987. The principal prosecution witness was also involved in the arrangement. A relevant issue on appeal was whether the prosecution had rightly been allowed to call evidence of earlier involvement of both in the sale of heroin. Brennan J identified the issue in the following terms: [8] 
	


“The argument against admission of the disputed evidence is simply that that evidence revealed the commission by Harriman of offences other than those on which he stood charged. In the Court of Criminal Appeal, the case was argued as though the evidence in dispute were evidence of similar facts. But the disputed evidence is not evidence of similar facts; the offences revealed by evidence of prior sales and use of heroin are not offences of the same kind or character as the offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin. The probative force of the evidence objected to in this case was not found in a factual similarity between the offences revealed by that evidence and the offences with which Harriman stood charged.”


	
	Brennan J then noted that the same principle should apply because the proffered evidence tended to show the commission of other offences or at least a predisposition to commit other offences. Brennan J continued:
	


“However, where evidence does show more than the mere commission of another offence or predisposition to commit an offence and is otherwise probative of the offence charged or of a fact in issue, there is no rule of evidence which compels its exclusion. … But, for my part, I do not find the classification of evidence revealing the commission of another offence as ‘circumstantial’ to be helpful in ascertaining the criterion of its admissibility. Whatever the classification of the evidence, its admissibility depends on its satisfaction of the criterion that its probative force clearly transcends its merely prejudicial effect”.


	
	Dawson J reasoned in similar terms, stating: [9] 
	


“Propensity evidence is, of course, circumstantial evidence in that the only proof which it can offer is proof by inference. But it is circumstantial evidence of a dangerous kind because of the prejudice which it engenders. That is why the occasions upon which it is admissible are strictly limited.”


	
	It is not necessary to stay to consider how Harriman assisted the respondent in the present case. There is a more important lesson, namely that, under the general law, questions of admissibility of otherwise probative evidence only arose because of the high risk of prejudice if the evidence revealed prior offences or a propensity to commit such offences. That may be contrasted with the statement of the coincidence rule in s 98 of the Evidence Act:
	


98   The coincidence rule

(1)   Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless:

(a)    the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b)   the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

Note. One of the events referred to in subsection (1) may be an event the occurrence of which is a fact in issue in the proceeding.


	
	What is striking about this provision is the absence of any reference to either of the “two or more events” as involving the commission of other offences or the demonstration of bad character. The rationale for the rule is missing from the statutory provision. The same is apparent from the statement of the tendency rule:
	


97   The tendency rule

(1)   Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a)   the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b)   the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.


	
	For most of its history, the generality of these provisions has gone largely unremarked upon, partly no doubt because the initial tendency was to assume that there had been little or limited change from the general law. That approach was rejected by this Court in R v Ellis. [10]  Once the close linkage with the general law was broken, it became necessary to identify with more care the mischief to which the provisions were directed. Without such an understanding, the ordinary meaning of the words used would create a serious element of overreach.
	
	
	The first clue that something more is required than an abstract application of the language of the provisions may be seen in the requirement that the evidence have “significant probative value.” [11]  The second clue comes from reading those provisions with s 101 which is said to apply “in addition to sections 97 and 98.” [12]  Section 101 requires that tendency and coincidence evidence cannot be used against a defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect. This language inevitably leads one back to the general law principles, in order to identify the kind of prejudice to which the section appears to be directed. There will remain a question as to the extent to which the legislation varies the general law as in force prior to its enactment.
	
	
	It is not necessary to pursue these questions further in this case, it being sufficient to note that the confusion revealed in some of the submissions (both in this Court and at trial) may not be entirely the fault of counsel.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the pre-trial application, the judge delivered reasons for rejecting the application for separate trials on a number of counts in the indictment. [13]  The submissions at trial were summarised in the following passage: [14] 
	


“The argument as to separating counts 10 to 14 on behalf of the accused Mr Glover and Mr Stuart that there is a difference between the first four robberies, that is 4 May 2011 at the Nelson Hotel, 4 May 2011 at the Sands Hotel, 7 June 2011 at the Rose of Australia Hotel, 7 June 2011 the Excelsior Hotel, for which each of the accused is charged, the last three alleged robberies being on 18 July 2011 at Malabar RSL, 7 September 2011, which is an attempted robbery at the Malabar RSL, and 12 September 2011, the Regent Hotel. On the last two only Mr Glover and Mr Stuart are charged because Mr Carr is in custody on that dates.”


	
	The judge then noted that the prosecution case was “circumstantial”, [15]  but held that there was legitimate probative value in having the jury hear the common elements on all charges and, in effect, aspects of each charge which affected each accused both on that charge and other charges. However, the judge said that he was not ruling on whether the prosecution should be allowed to lead coincidence evidence, noting that that would have been “another basis on which to sever the counts”. [16] 
	
	
	Having delivered those reasons, the judge again remarked that he had not ruled on the admissibility of the coincidence evidence as such, stating that he thought he would be in a better position to do that once the evidence had been given. He invited counsel to express a different view, but counsel for each of the co-accused in turn accepted that that was the appropriate course. [17] 
	
	
	Consistently with that approach, on the fortieth day of the trial (29 July 2013) and with virtually all the prosecution evidence tendered, the prosecutor stated: [18] 
	


“It might be appropriate at this stage to consider a number of issues. Any applications in terms of whether there is a case to answer on any of the counts and to deal with the issue concerning whether your Honour will contemplate allowing the Crown to deal in address with the evidence in terms of coincidence and tendency evidence.”


	
	That proposal was taken up and each counsel addressed. In particular, counsel for Mr Stuart submitted that the evidence of one count should not be available on others, but accepting that the events of a single day were relevant to each offence on that day. The thrust of her submissions may be seen in the following brief extracts: [19] 
	


“Even if the jury were to accept that black and red gloves that were found in Mr Stuart’s possession were the ones used in the Regent, that does not get the Crown to the point where they can say those are the gloves based on the evidence before the jury that were used in earlier robberies, that being the one at The Nelson and by the link from The Nelson to The Sands, also at The Sands, and the third one would in fact be the robbery at Malabar on 18 July. I don’t think it gets him there because it’s just not the evidence before the jury that these distinct red and black gloves were seen and can be placed at other robberies that happened earlier.

As such, on that basis, the Crown should not be allowed to run a tendency or coincidence argument, whatever it happens to be, based on the red gloves because the evidence isn’t strong enough to say that they were used in other robberies. ….

I also want to say something about … the use of the telephone records both Exhibit 4B which is the summary done by the police of telephone calls, and also the call records themselves…. In each case, in relation to each robbery, the Crown wants to be able to say well look, there’s no activity on these phones during the periods of X and Y. I submit that the Crown should not be able to be allowed to lead that evidence in that form because the Crown has only led evidence of the outgoing calls of Mr Stuart’s mobile telephone service, and incoming calls and text messages, often referred to as SMSs, have not been led.”


	
	The trial judge dealt with the matter in a further interlocutory judgment on Tuesday, 30 July 2013. Having set out the provisions of the Evidence Act the judge accepted the submissions of the prosecution in the following passage: [20] 
	


“The Crown submits that the coincidence evidence comes from a number of matters which include red and black gloves which are seen on CCTV of robberies at the Sands Hotel, Malabar RSL and the Regent Hotel, it is in evidence of witnesses at the Nelson Hotel, that the robberies fall into a certain type, namely one of the robbers is armed with a handgun and the other with an object, the general description is one is taller and the Crown allege that that is Stuart and one a little shorter, Glover, and one driving the motor vehicle, Carr.

The way the armed robberies were carried out was one man asked for the manager or someone in authority, the other controls the bar area often or usually, having patrons get down on the floor. In relation to the first four robberies the same motor vehicle was used. My own observation of the robberies from viewing the CCTV was that they were remarkably similar. The way they were carried out was very similar, disguise, stolen vehicle and other matters.

…

I formed the view, and of course I’ve had the advantage of hearing all the evidence in the case, that that evidence, as far as coincidence, is concerned, has probative value in accordance with s 101.”


	
	Having earlier set out the terms of s 101, the last comment should be understood as a finding that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect.
	
	
	The judge then turned to matters relevant to Mr Carr and Mr Glover. He reviewed the arguments put by counsel for Mr Stuart, noting the submission that there was no need for coincidence evidence in relation to counts 2 and 3 or 5 and 6, as it was probably obvious that those armed robberies were carried out by the same people. The judge then stated: [21] 
	


“The evidence which the Crown relies on to argue coincidence is the same evidence which is already before the jury.

There is evidence of fact, there is evidence of circumstantial evidence. By allowing the Crown to argue coincidence it does give them the benefit of an additional submission to the jury but the evidence will be the same, although there may be, should I disallow such evidence, an argument that one or more charges could not be allowed to go to the jury. In the end, I will have to give a direction of law to the jury.”


	
	The judge concluded: [22] 
	


“In addition there is another body of evidence, including DNA, telephone calls, motor vehicles, keys and other matters which will be before the jury when they are considering the Crown’s circumstantial case. The evidence has, in certain parts, a striking similarity sufficient for coincidence.

Having found that it is probative, then I turn to look at the prejudice and, of course, any evidence is going to be prejudicial, that is why it is called. However, that evidence is all before the jury. The only difference is, as I said earlier, the way it will be argued and perhaps the effect it may have on evidence of several of the charges. I do not see that there is any other prejudice other than that and I am therefore satisfied that I should allow the Crown to lead the coincidence evidence.”


	
	The judge then turned to the question of its use as “tendency evidence” and concluded that it should not be admitted as such. [23] 
	
	
	In reaching these conclusions, the trial judge expressly acknowledged that the manner in which the evidence would be left to the jury would require careful directions (which had not then been formulated). However, apart from a challenge to the ruling set out above, there was no challenge in this Court to the directions in fact given. The evidence all being before the jury, either one would expect a challenge to the adequacy of the directions, or a final application to discharge the jury if the directions proved, in the view of counsel, to be inadequate. No such step was taken.
	
	
	The complaints raised for Mr Stuart in relation to these findings were largely semantic. Thus it was submitted that (a) the judge had not referred to the evidence having “significant” probative value; (b) although remarking that in his view the robberies were “remarkably similar”, he did not expressly say whether a jury might assign significant probative value to the evidence; (c) by failing to address the hypothesis that the first four robberies may have been committed by someone other than Mr Stuart, failed to identify a realistic possible alternative hypothesis; (d) failed to identify the potential prejudice and, finally, (e) failed to weigh the probative value against the prejudice to ensure that the former substantially outweighed the latter.
	
	
	None of these complaints have substance. It is true that, in expressing conclusions, the judge did not tightly follow the language of the statute. Nevertheless, the setting out of the provisions, the reference to relevant aspects of the authorities and the discussion of the evidence demonstrate an application of the statutory requirements. So far as it is suggested that he did not take account of an alternative hypothesis that some third party was involved in the earlier offences, it need only be said that the whole case turned on that possibility: there was no dispute that each of the offences took place – the only question was who committed them.
	
	
	Finally, the suggestion that he “failed to identify the unfair prejudice” was simply that he ignored the type of prejudice that was “inevitable” with coincidence evidence. As already suggested, there is no prejudice which necessarily follows from coincidence evidence, unless it concerns other offending. In this case the Court was addressing a number of related offences, all of which were the subject of specific charges. There was no question of earlier uncharged offences (as in Harriman), nor reliance upon earlier convictions for other offences. Furthermore, the submission failed to recognise an important element in s 98, namely that the significant probative value of the evidence may be identified by having regard not merely to that evidence, but also to other evidence adduced in the course of the trial. This exercise required identifying features of other robberies which coincided with features of each specific robbery to which it might be considered coincident.
	
	
	The specific challenges to the reasoning of the trial judge should be rejected. Even had that not been the case, it is doubtful that a challenge could have succeeded to the use of the evidence in circumstances where there was no challenge to the directions given to the jury with respect to that evidence. No doubt an objection taken in the course of the summing up might have been met by the response that the directions given were consistent with the ruling on admissibility, but one would expect, on the appeal, that some element of prejudice could be demonstrated from the inadequacy of the directions, if the ruling on admissibility were indeed open to challenge.
	
	
	Ground 1 in Mr Stuart’s appeal should be rejected.
	


Principles – unreasonable verdicts


	
	There remains the challenge, brought by both Mr Stuart and Mr Glover, on the basis that the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable and not able to be supported on the evidence. [24]  The course required of the Court in addressing such a ground is well understood. [25]  The Court, reviewing the evidence, must determine whether it entertains a reasonable doubt as to the conviction on each charge. In some circumstances the availability of a reasonable doubt may depend upon an assessment of the oral evidence, being a matter for the jury, which may not readily be assessed by an appellate court. The applicants submitted, with good reason, that in this case the appellate court did not suffer from the usual constraints which arise in cases where the credibility of witnesses is at stake. On the other hand, it remains true that the Court has not had the exposure to the full weight of the evidence over a lengthy trial, as had the jury. In any event, it is necessary to turn to an assessment of the evidence relevant on each count to address this ground.
	
	
	In approaching the matter in this way, no departure is intended from the general approach helpfully articulated by McCallum J below.
	


The circumstantial case for the prosecution

(a)   overview of evidence


	
	What follows is a brief synopsis of the evidence and arguments presented at the trial. The trial continued over 50 days; the evidence commenced on day nine and was completed on day 41; the prosecutor’s address extended over three days; counsel for the accused addressed over some six days and the judge’s summing up took approximately two days, without canvassing the evidence in detail. The transcript of the evidence ran to approximately 2,000 pages. What follows is derived from various sources; unfortunately, the submissions in this Court tended (perhaps understandably) to make the best of each party’s position with limited concessions as to possible weaknesses.
	
	
	By way of example, a key passage in the prosecutor’s submissions stated:
	


“The modus operandi for all robberies was the same. Each was committed on licensed premises and involved two persons entering the premises, one of whom was armed with a hand gun. A third person remained outside in a stolen high-performance getaway car, usually fitted with stolen number plates. Of the persons who entered the premises, one would seek out the manager or a person in authority, escort them to a location where cash was stored, such as a safe or an ATM and demand the money, whilst the other remained in the bar area armed with the hand-gun, ensuring patrons remained immobile on the floor. There was evidence that a hand gun was used in all robberies. On some occasions the man with the gun would demand money from staff at the cash register. CCTV footage of robberies giving rise to counts 9 & 10, 11 & 12, depicts one of the offenders holding a silver coloured revolver.”


	
	An inference drawn on the basis of coincidence reasoning is usually expressed in the negative, namely that if events which occur on two separate occasions are characterised by unusual similarities, they are unlikely to be independent. Put in the affirmative, the unusual characteristics make it likely that, for example, the same actors were involved. In some circumstances, the general law refers to the element of “striking similarities”. [26]  The term “striking” is a colourful epithet, but is not precise as to the sense in which the similarities should strike one. The term “unusual” is perhaps more helpful, as may be illustrated by the description set out above. Thus, the fact that the robberies were all committed on licensed premises is not a patently unusual circumstance. As the evidence already referred to indicated, a task force was set up to deal with a spate of such robberies; nevertheless, the offenders were charged only with respect to seven independent events and there were others which bore some elements of similarity to those seven, but for which the police did not have grounds to charge the applicants. Targets of armed robbery are likely to be places which may be expected to hold significant sums of cash and to be vulnerable to attack by two persons of whom one is likely to be armed.
	
	
	To similar effect, the prosecutor was inclined to dismiss as insignificant the hearsay evidence extracted from Detective Jouni in cross-examination that the black Audi MS 2530 had been seen by police to be driven by another person entirely, Mr Jack Dunne, as a getaway vehicle for an aggravated break and enter which occurred on 14 May at Belrose. That offence occurred between the robberies on 4 May 2011 (which were said to have involved Mr Carr as the driver as well as the applicants Glover and Stuart) and the robbery on 7 June, also said to have involved the applicants. The inference the applicants sought to draw from Detective Jouni’s evidence was that others had access to the vehicle and the mere presence of the vehicle at an armed robbery did not necessarily implicate them.
	
	
	While it is likely that many hotels and clubs are vulnerable in the sense noted above, some are likely to be more vulnerable than others and to be vulnerable at particular times of day or night. All the robberies the subject of the indictment took place while there were staff present. That is, none involved a break and enter out of hours, no doubt because the offenders required assistance to obtain access to potential sources of cash, such as safes and ATMs. On the other hand, the presence of CCTV might have been thought to make some licensed premises less attractive as targets than others: however, all but one of the robberies occurred in premises with CCTV.
	
	
	Leaving to one side the modus operandi and the nature of the targets, the prosecution relied on the following further categories of similarity:
	


(a)   descriptions of personal characteristics of the offenders;

(b)   descriptions of the clothing worn by the offenders;

(c)   descriptions of the weapon or weapons used by the offenders;

(d)   pre and post robbery information as to the financial circumstances of the applicants (based on telephone intercepts), and

(e)   contact by mobile phone and periods of telephone silence for mobile phones owned by the applicants during the robberies.


	
	In the course of the appeal, significant weight was placed by the prosecutor on the implications to be drawn from the telephone records. However, before turning to the records, it is necessary to set out certain established facts relating to the applicants. First, each applicant signed a document pursuant to s 184 of the Evidence Act, admitting certain facts. Mr Glover’s statement is not before the Court, but it is contained in the prosecutor’s summary of trial in terms to which no objection was taken and which reads as follows:
	


“… Laurence Glover admitted he was born on 8 June 1987 of Anglo-Ghanaian heritage; in 2011 he knew Nathan Stuart and Bradley Carr and socialised with them; in 2011 he was in a relationship with Dayna Jennings, she lived at … Gardeners Road, Kingsford and he was a regular and frequent visitor there; in 2011 he had access to and utilised [identified] mobile phone numbers ….”


	
	Mr Stuart admitted that he had stolen the keys for and the Mercedes BNN 77U on 9 August 2011, being the car used in the two robberies in September 2011. He also admitted he knew, and that in 2011 he socialised with, Bradley Carr and Laurence Glover. He agreed that he knew Kane Hoskin and socialised with him during 2011, Hoskin being the co-offender with respect to the robbery at the Regent Hotel on 12 September. He further admitted that his nickname was “Crawley” and that, for relevant periods in 2011, he owned certain identified mobile telephones.
	
	
	The mobile telephone numbers of each were relevant to an understanding of the telephone intercepts and telephone records. Carr’s telephone numbers were also identified and not in dispute.
	
	
	It was also agreed that Mr Stuart was 178cm (5ft 11in) and Mr Glover was 169cm (5ft 7in).
	
	
	The police obtained telephone records for each of the applicants covering the periods at and around the times of each robbery. Although there were many calls made on each mobile, there was a conspicuous silence for a period usually spanning several hours, including typically an hour or two on either side of each robbery. For the later robberies (counts 11 and 12) there were shorter times; for Mr Stuart before count 11, 40 minutes and for Mr Glover, after count 12, only 10 minutes. The consequence of inactivity for a period was that the location of the phone, and by inference, of its owner, could not be identified during that time. The further inference was that each of them knew that. As explained by the prosecutor in his address, the periods of inactivity were logged by police intercepting the calls, being both outgoing and incoming calls. [27] 
	
	
	The significance of the periods of telephone inactivity for a particular accused was not merely that the periods coincided with the commission of the offences (there were other periods of inactivity), but that fact in combination with the inactivity of the mobiles of each accused during the relevant period. As was submitted for Mr Glover on the appeal, the fact that the records for his client indicated significant periods of inactivity at times unrelated to the offences tended to dilute the significance of the inactivity at the times of the alleged offending. In other words, each period of inactivity could have had an innocent explanation. So far as it went, the submission should be accepted.
	
	
	So far as the second limb of the prosecution’s argument was concerned, Mr Glover submitted that the other alleged offenders may have had their own reasons for switching off their mobiles, which were not necessarily the same as for Mr Glover. That submission is more problematic than the first: the inference is significantly stronger viewing the telephone records of all three together than any inference which might be drawn from one in isolation from the others, bearing in mind that they were associates and communicated with each other frequently.
	
	
	It may be accepted that the telephone records alone did not wholly exclude the possibility of an innocent explanation and were therefore not conclusive. They did, however, carry significant weight as circumstantial evidence. Mr Glover submitted that the other circumstantial evidence in relation to Mr Stuart and Mr Carr was significantly stronger than that in relation to him. Accordingly, he submitted, there was a real risk that he may have been convicted on the basis of his long association with Mr Stuart and the strong evidence against him with respect to the two offences involving the black Mercedes.
	


(b)   Glover – counts 9 and 10


	
	There were, as counsel accepted, some qualifications required with respect to the last proposition and, in particular, with respect to counts 9 and 10. First, counts 9 and 10, like count 11, took place at the Malabar RSL. Secondly, counts 9 and 10 involved the second stolen Audi, BLE 66F. A number plate for BLE 66F was located in the stolen Mercedes, in the garage associated with Mr Glover.
	
	
	Further, telephone intercepts of conversations on 11 July 2011 indicated that neither Glover nor Stuart had money. The robbery on 18 July took place in the morning: intercepts on the evening of the same day (and on a number of following days) indicated that both Glover and Stuart were visiting hotels and brothels. It may be inferred that they had come by significant amounts of money to spend.
	
	
	On the morning of 18 July, Messrs Glover and Stuart had been in contact from 4.38am. At 8.03am Stuart used Glover’s phone to book a taxi. At 9.02am Glover and Stuart were together and spoke to Mr Carr who agreed to catch a taxi to meet them. Between 8.09am and 8.58am Stuart and Carr exchanged some 14 text messages or calls. There was no recorded activity for either Carr or Glover from 9.02am (when Glover contacted Carr) until 12.39 (when Carr sent a message to a third person) and 1.40pm (when Glover spoke to a third person). The last activity on Stuart’s phone, namely the call at 9.20am to Bradley Carr was diverted, indicating that Carr had turned his phone off between 9.02 and 9.20. [28] 
	
	
	The evidence associating Mr Glover with the robbery at the Malabar RSL on 18 July 2011 constituted a strong prosecution case. It was not a case based on “association” in the social sense; it was based upon close contact between all three co-offenders, who met approximately two hours before the offence was committed, turned off their mobile phones until one or two hours after the offence had been committed and then demonstrated access to recent wealth. Further, there was the connection revealed by Mr Glover having in the Mercedes in his girlfriend’s garage a number plate from the car used in the RSL robbery. None of this evidence could be explained by a reasonable alternative hypothesis. Accordingly, Mr Glover’s challenge to the convictions on counts 9 and 10 should be rejected.
	


(c)   Glover and Stuart – counts 5 and 6 (7 June 2011)


	
	The earlier counts may be dealt with in two groups. Counts 2, 3 and 4 all related to hotel robberies on 4 May 2011, involving three men and the same car. There was ample reason to conclude that the two robberies were committed by the same persons.
	
	
	A similar conclusion may be reached with respect to counts 5 and 6, which involved two hotel robberies on 7 June 2011. Each involved the same car, bearing the same stolen plates, AWC 07T. Again, there was ample evidence to support the conclusion that both were conducted by the same three men. In considering who those men were, it will be necessary to refer to both the telephone intercepts, the periods of telephone inactivity and the appearance of the offenders, where recorded on CCTV and described by witnesses. Although Mr Glover submitted that the evidence linking him to the offending was weaker than that of the other accused, it is convenient to consider both Glover and Stuart together.
	
	
	With respect to the events on the evening of 7 June 2011, the earlier robbery took place at the Rose of Australia Hotel, Erskineville, at about 10.50pm. The activities of the offenders were partly recorded on CCTV. It was an element of the prosecution case that one of the two offenders was significantly taller than the other.
	
	
	The robbery at the Excelsior Hotel, Surry Hills, occurred some 15 minutes later. Those events were also recorded on CCTV. There could be no doubt that the two offenders were the same. The taller man, Mr Stuart on the prosecution case, was wearing a blue hooded top and grey pants. On each occasion he had black gloves and an instrument described by witnesses as a screwdriver. On each occasion he went in first and sought the manager and attempted to obtain cash from the cash room. The shorter man (Mr Glover on the prosecution case) wore a dark top with white stripes down the sleeves. He had pink gloves and carried a hand gun. In each case he remained in the bar area controlling staff and customers. At the Rose of Australia, he may be seen to take money from a till.
	
	
	Turning to the telephone activity on 7 June, Glover and Stuart were in contact on two occasions in the early afternoon, (at 12.26pm and 1.50pm) and on two occasions in the early evening (at 6.20 and 6.46pm). Between 6.58pm and 8.50pm Glover and Carr communicated on five occasions. All three accused had a period of telephone silence from approximately 1.5 hours before the robberies until an hour thereafter.
	
	
	A telephone intercept on 3 June records Bradley Carr saying, “I’ve got $50 to me name.” On 7 June at 10.38am Nathan Stuart tells a friend that he could not go to see her because “I have to go somewhere to go and pick up some money and stuff”. He also said, “I don’t have much money.” Stuart repeated that statement to Glover in a conversation at 1.49 that afternoon. Glover also said, “I’ve got nothing.” They talked further at 6.20pm that evening, Glover stating that he had no money and they arranged to meet in 20 minutes. It is clear from the intercepts of the calls at 6.20 and 6.58 that Stuart and Glover met at around 7pm. It is also clear that Glover and Carr and “the other bloke” met around 9pm.
	
	
	At 11.37 the next morning, Glover spoke to Stuart about going to a brothel and getting lunch. The lack of cash both had suffered on the previous day was no longer a problem. As described at [13] above, Carr accessed the police website, and specifically the media releases for these offences, three days later.
	
	
	The CCTV footage would not be sufficient to identify either Stuart or Glover as the offenders, although the build and height of the offenders is consistent with the respective height and build of each. However, the indications of lack of cash immediately prior to the robbery, the arrangement to meet that evening, the telephone inactivity at the time of the robbery and (for Stuart and Glover) for an hour on either side, together with having ready cash immediately thereafter, their associate (Carr) whom they had met earlier that evening demonstrating interest in police media releases only three days later, combined to create a strong prosecution case. The evidence was inconsistent with cash being obtained from a steady source such as employment, although it was not inconsistent with ready cash resulting from gambling. Nevertheless, in combination with the other factors it was sufficient to exclude any reasonable doubt as to the source of the money. That material in combination pointed clearly to the applicants being the offenders with respect to the robberies on 7 June 2011.
	


(d)   Glover and Stuart – counts 2, 3 and 4 (4 May 2011)


	
	A similar analysis may be undertaken with respect to the robberies on 4 May 2011. Although the same vehicle was used, there remains a reasonable possibility that those having access to the vehicle were not restricted to the same persons on each occasion. One may, however, readily infer that the three men in the vehicle at about 10.10pm at the Nelson Hotel, Bondi Junction were the same three men using the vehicle for the same purpose (namely as a getaway car) at Maroubra, 20 minutes later. The main difference in the analysis with respect to these events was the absence of CCTV footage of the robberies at the Nelson Hotel, Bondi Junction.
	
	
	The CCTV footage at the Sands Hotel, Maroubra showed the taller man entering the hotel first, wearing a light blue hooded jumper with words written in white on the chest. (The words are not decipherable.) The duty manager at the Nelson Hotel, Mr Cook, described the man as wearing a light blue hooded top with writing about the middle and black gloves. [29]  That description matched the appearance of the man on the CCTV at the Sands.
	
	
	Mr Cook also described the height of the first man, saying that he was “five, six foot, may be five ten, a bit taller than me” and then, “I’m about five ten, five eleven”. He described the colour of his skin as “[a] bit more tan sort of styles” but said that he wasn’t looking closely because he was more worried about what the man had in his hand. [30]  He also saw the second man in the saloon bar whom he described as “a bit shorter than me but more – more solid.” He said he was wearing “just dark clothing”. He had something in his hand, although Mr Cook was unable to identify it. [31] 
	
	
	Ms Kearney was working as a barmaid at the Nelson Hotel on the evening. She saw the two men walk in through the doors and noticed that one had a blue hoodie and a covered face while the other one was wearing a dark colour “like black or blue maybe”. She could only see their eyes. [32]  She too gave evidence that the first man was a little taller than the second man. She described the second man as wearing “red gloves – like red woollen ski kind of gloves.” [33]  She also agreed that she had told the police shortly after the robbery that the first man was about five foot eleven inches tall and of average build. She repeated her estimate that the second man was about five foot eight inches, which was her own height. [34] 
	
	
	Again, the descriptions were consistent with the images of the men in the CCTV footage at the Maroubra robbery. They were also consistent with the agreed heights of the applicants.
	
	
	Both Mr Cook and Ms Kearney said that the robber in the bar area was carrying something in his hand, but they could not say what. However, Mr Sobb, who was also working in the bar said that when he put his head up over the bar, he saw the man was holding a gun, but his evidence was somewhat confused as to the kind of gun.
	
	
	The telephone records for 4 May reveal that Carr and Stuart arranged to meet shortly after 12.30 on the day of the robberies. There was a call between Glover and Stuart at 3.10 in the afternoon, but not thereafter, which may have been consistent with them being together later that afternoon. There was no activity on Glover’s phone from 5.25 that afternoon until 11.34 that night. There was no activity on Stuart’s phone from 7.16pm until 11.47 that night. There was no activity on Carr’s phone from 9.36 (an incoming call) until 11.20 that night.
	
	
	This evidence was somewhat weaker than the evidence with respect to the later robberies. There was no evidence of lack of funds prior to these robberies and, while there was evidence of Carr spending freely during the two days following the robberies, there was no evidence of Stuart and Glover spending money after the robberies. While there was evidence of Mr Stuart and Mr Carr being together on the afternoon preceding the robberies, there was no clear evidence that Mr Glover was with them. The case against Glover and Stuart therefore depended significantly on the descriptions of the offenders and the images recorded on the CCTV at Maroubra.
	
	
	The evidence involving Mr Carr as the driver of the black Audi was persuasive. He was convicted of destroying the car two weeks after the June 7 robbery at the Excelsior Hotel, giving rise to a reasonable inference that he was destroying incriminating evidence in relation to his role in the earlier robberies. Accordingly, Stuart’s connection with Carr on the afternoon of May 4, together with his appearance on the CCTV footage provides evidence of him being an offender.
	
	
	This evidence does not take the case much further against Glover. The prosecution relied upon the evidence that the gloves worn by the second robber in the Sands Hotel robbery, which appear to be red or red and black, bore a clear resemblance to those worn by one of the offenders with respect to counts 9 and 10 and count 12. Red and black gloves were found in the course of the search of Mr Stuart’s premises. However, that connected Mr Stuart with the earlier robberies, but not necessarily Mr Glover.
	
	
	A forensic imagery expert, Mr McCourt, called by the prosecution, prepared a document comparing the CCTV images of three robberies showing what appeared to be red and black gloves on the hands of one robber with the red and black gloves obtained from Mr Stuart’s premises. However the comparative exercise (contained in Ex 4N) was limited to three of the robberies, being those which occurred on 18 July, 7 September and 12 September 2011. [35]  This evidence did not assist in identifying the gloves shown in the CCTV record from the Sands Hotel. Without such assistance, a sensible comparison is not possible.
	
	
	There is certainly a reasonable resemblance between the CCTV footage of the second person to enter the hotels on the earlier occasions, and sufficient evidence to link Mr Glover with the June 7 robbery. Nevertheless, in my view the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that he was the second man to enter the hotels on 4 May. The appearance and description of the gloves gave some indication that they may well have been the same gloves as those used in the later robberies with which he was implicated, but the evidence was by no means persuasive on its own. The dark jacket being worn by the second offender on 4 May was not the same as the jacket being worn by the offender on 7 June. Although both were black, one had a double (or possibly triple) stripe down the sleeves, the other had a white line which extended across the sleeves and across the back of the jacket, as appears from the CCTV footage at the Sands Hotel, although not in the description given by any of the witnesses at Bondi Junction. That jacket was not recovered in the searches.
	
	
	It is likely that Mr Glover, being a member of the team on later occasions was the third member of the team on 4 May. There was some evidence specific to the offences on 4 May to support that inference. However, that material was not sufficient to link him with Stuart and Carr on the first occasion; it is a reasonable possibility that some other person was the third offender. In these circumstances, I would have a reasonable doubt as to whether Mr Glover was the second robber in the two robberies on 4 May. I am not persuaded that there was any factor relating to the trial which suggested that the jury should not have entertained a similar doubt.
	


Conclusions


	
	The appeal was run on behalf of the Director on the basis that the jury was entitled to work backwards from the later offences, based on the similarity between all the offending so as to be satisfied as to the guilt of the accused with respect to the earlier offences. That was a permissible line of reasoning: however, if the similarities were not persuasive in relation to the earlier offending, a reasonable doubt may arise as to whether a particular person was implicated in that offence. In my view the convictions of Laurence Glover with respect to the offences on 4 May 2011 (counts 2-4) cannot stand. It follows that his sentences must be adjusted.
	
	
	The evidence linking Nathan Stuart to the earlier offences was persuasive; it did not leave me with a reasonable doubt that he was the taller robber, who entered first on each occasion. His appeal in relation to each count on which he was convicted must be dismissed.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: I have read the judgments of Basten JA and R A Hulme J in draft. Their Honours agree that Stuart’s appeal against conviction, and Glover’s appeal against conviction in respect of counts 5, 6, 9 and 10, should be dismissed. I also agree with those conclusions, for the reasons stated by Basten JA.
	
	
	As to Glover’s appeal against conviction in respect of counts 2, 3 and 4, Basten JA would allow the appeal whereas R A Hulme J would dismiss it. I agree with R A Hulme J that the appeal in respect of those counts should be dismissed.
	
	
	Glover’s appeal invokes the power of this Court under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to set aside the verdict of a jury if the Court is of the opinion that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. Although the principles to be applied in determining such a ground are well-established, I wish to emphasise an aspect of the relevant jurisprudence which has influenced my conclusion. I am here in part repeating or refining what I said in Hawi v R [2014] NSWCCA 83 at [476] to [480].
	
	
	It is well-established that, in determining such a ground, this Court must make an “independent assessment of the evidence”. The existence of that function has long been recognised: Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; 131 CLR 510 at 516.1 per Barwick CJ; Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) [1984] HCA 7; 153 CLR 521 at 534 per Gibbs CJ and Mason J; Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 463, 473, 478. It is clear that it is a function which must be discharged carefully, with a view to assessing the “probative value” of the evidence (Morris at 463 per Mason CJ) both as to its sufficiency and its quality (Morris at 473 per Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ).
	
	
	It is important to bear in mind the purpose for which that function is performed, which is to determine whether the jury, acting reasonably, must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused: Chamberlain at 534.3; Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113] per Hayne J (citing M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 492 to 493). One of the issues considered in the joint judgment in M was whether, in stating the test in such terms, it was necessary to qualify the statement of Barwick CJ in Ratten that the same task could equally be expressed by reference to a doubt entertained by the appellate court itself. The majority in M did not think the difference mattered. It was in that context that the majority said, famously (at 494), “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced.”
	
	
	That quote and the remarks that follow it are frequently cited in this Court as a seminal statement of principle governing appeals of this kind. There is no vice in doing so, provided the passage is read in context. The assertion as to what will be the position “in most cases” was not itself a statement of principle. It was the explanation for the view stated in the previous sentence that it is “possible to make too much both of the view expressed by Barwick CJ and of the qualification suggested”. The “qualification” was explained in the preceding paragraph:
	


To ask only whether the court has a doubt may place insufficient emphasis upon the fact that the jury, having seen and heard the evidence given, was in a position to evaluate that evidence in a manner in which a court of appeal cannot.


	
	If there is no difference between Barwick CJ in Ratten and Chamberlain, I prefer the formulation approved in Chamberlain, that is, whether the jury, acting reasonably, must have entertained a reasonable doubt or, as it was put by Hayne J in Libke at [113] (emphasis in original):
	


“the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt.”


	
	My reason for preferring that formulation is that it is more accurate, since it acknowledges the function of the jury as the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence (a point reiterated in an earlier passage in M at 493.8). In an appeal, the Crown does not have to discharge an onus of proof beyond reasonable doubt for a second time; this Court is entrusted with the function of undertaking an independent assessment of the evidence for a different purpose. Submissions invoking the frequently quoted-passage from M sometimes appear to suggest otherwise.
	
	
	For the reasons stated by R A Hulme J, my own assessment of the evidence has not persuaded me that the jury must or ought to have entertained a doubt as to Glover’s guilt of the first two robberies.
	
	
	This Court is of course able to make an assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence in a circumstantial case but the advantage enjoyed by the jury in such a case is, in my view, important. It is not confined to the benefit each individual juror has of seeing and hearing the witnesses. The strength of 12 jurors as a tribunal of fact derives also from their number, their diversity and their opportunity to hear the evidence continuously and to deliberate as a group in private throughout the trial, evaluating the evidence together as it is given rather than reading the transcript afterwards on one’s own.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Basten JA that the appeal against conviction by Stuart should be dismissed for the reasons his Honour has provided.
	
	
	I also agree that the appeal by Glover in respect of his convictions on counts 5, 6, 9 and 10 should be dismissed. However I have come to a conclusion that differs from his Honour's in respect of the convictions on counts 2, 3 and 4.
	
	
	Before turning to my reasons for concluding that the convictions on counts 2 to 4 were not unreasonable or not unsupported by the evidence it is appropriate to be clear about the approach to be taken to a case, such as this, that concerns circumstantial evidence. It was usefully and authoritatively summarised by McClellan CJ at CL (as his Honour then was) in Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21:
	


“[51] A case is not defective or bound to fail merely because it relies upon circumstantial evidence to the exclusion of direct evidence. The strength of circumstantial evidence lies in its ability to show that, ‘according to the common course of human affairs, the degree of probability that the occurrence of the facts proved would be accompanied by the occurrence of the fact to be proved is so high that the contrary cannot reasonably be supposed’: Martin v Osborne [1936] HCA 23; (1936) 55 CLR 367 at 375 (Dixon J). It has been said that ‘circumstantial evidence is very often the best [evidence]’: R v Taylor, Weaver and Donovan (1928) 21 Cr App R 20 at 21 (Hewart LCJ).

[52] When, as here, the case against the accused is entirely or substantially circumstantial, ‘the jury cannot return a verdict of guilty unless the circumstances are such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused’: Barca v The Queen [1975] HCA 42; (1975) 133 CLR 82 at 104 (Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ) citing Peacock v The King [1911] HCA 66; (1911) 13 CLR 619 at 634; see also Plomp v The Queen [1963] HCA 44; (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 252. That statement of principle is uncontroversial. It is really ‘no more than an amplification of the rule that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt’: Knight v The Queen [1992] HCA 56; (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 502 (Mason CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ) quoting Shepherd at 578 (Dawson J).

[53] At the same time, the trier of fact must bear in mind that a circumstantial case is to be considered holistically: R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618 at [48]-[49] (Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ). Putting to one side for the moment ‘indispensable’ intermediate facts (as to which see Ground 5), it would be wrong for a jury to acquit an accused merely because it harbours reasonable doubts about some inculpatory evidence, though it ignores or unduly minimises other, more compelling evidence of the accused's guilt. As it is often the case that ‘one piece of evidence ... resolves doubts as to another’ (Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] [1984] HCA 7; (1984) 153 CLR 521 at 535 (Gibbs CJ and Mason J)), it is necessary to weigh and consider the totality of the evidence: Hillier at [48]-[49]. In doing so, the finder of fact ought not stretch credulity or engage in tortuous reasoning in order to explain away each and every individual circumstance as being consistent with innocence: R v Micallef [2002] NSWCCA 480; (2002) 136 A Crim R 127 at [42] (Dunford J); Burrell v R [2009] NSWCCA 193 at [55] (Giles JA).”


	
	The starting point is to endorse the acceptance by Basten JA of the proposition that whoever were the three men involved in the robberies at the Nelson Hotel at Bondi Junction, they were the same three men who were involved in the robbery at the Sands Hotel at Maroubra about 20 minutes later.
	
	
	Another basal proposition is that it was open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that Glover was guilty of the last five robbery incidents. I entertain no doubt myself about his guilt in respect of those matters. Further, I have no such doubt about the guilt of Messrs Stuart and Carr in respect of the robbery counts which they faced.
	
	
	That leads to the question whether it is a reasonable possibility that Stuart and Carr committed the robberies on 4 May 2011 with someone other than Glover. I do not believe that it is.
	
	
	My reasons for this conclusion include that it would be extraordinary that some unknown person played the role of second robber at the Nelson and the Sands hotels but did so in a virtually identical way to the way in which Glover performed that role in the ensuing five robbery incidents. Not only that, it would also entail that this unknown person happened to be of a height differential to Stuart by similar proportions as was Glover and was of a similar build to Glover. And further, it would have to be considered a realistic possibility that it was a mere coincidence that Glover's telephone was inactive before, during and after the 4 May robberies (as were the telephones of Stuart and Carr) just like his telephone was inactive during the later robberies.
	
	
	Whilst one may isolate individual items and argue that they do not support a conclusion of guilt beyond reasonable doubt it is important to look at the combined force of the evidence. In short, while I accept that the evidence specific to the 4 May robberies was less conclusive of the guilt of Glover when looked at in isolation, the coincidence evidence had a very real role to play. It would be inconsistent with the approach set out in the above passages from Wood v R to ignore it. Indeed, it was the very purpose for which the Crown was permitted to rely upon it.
	
	
	I also accept that there was evidence of other robberies of clubs and hotels being carried out in broadly the same time frame and there was evidence of the use of the first stolen Audi in other criminal activity, not by Glover, Stuart or Carr, in between the robberies on 4 May and those on 7 June. However, there is no suggestion that there were any other robberies that bore all of the hallmarks of the coincidence evidence that linked the offences for which Messrs Glover, Stuart and Carr were tried.
	
	
	Having made my own assessment of the evidence, I have no reasonable doubt about the guilt of both Glover and Stuart in respect of any of the robberies for which they were convicted. It follows that I am not persuaded that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Since circulating my judgment in draft I have had the opportunity to read the judgment of McCallum J. I respectfully agree with her Honour's review of High Court authority on the correct approach to the determination of a ground of appeal asserting an unreasonable or unsupportable verdict. I also agree with her Honour's practical and realistic description of the advantage enjoyed by a jury that must be acknowledged by an appellate court in a case such as the present.
	
	
	I propose that in the case of both Glover and Stuart the following orders should be made:
	


1   Leave to appeal against conviction granted.

2   Appeal against conviction dismissed.

2768200,R v Maybir (No 6) [2015] NSWSC 1741,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Brady SC on behalf of the accused has submitted that in the course of my summing-up to the jury I should direct them to determine the basis upon which any verdict of guilty of manslaughter has been arrived at.
	
	
	In this case manslaughter will go to the jury on two possible bases, the first is criminal negligence and is the basis upon which the accused pleaded guilty to manslaughter on arraignment in front of the jury panel. The basis of the negligence is a failure for a period of about 24 hours after the deceased child was injured to obtain medical attention, which would have had a prospect of saving the child's life.
	
	
	The alternative basis of manslaughter is unlawful and dangerous act, in that the accused committed a deliberate act or acts which caused the death of the deceased but the jury, not being satisfied of the Crown's contention that the act or acts were accompanied by an intention to kill or inflict really serious harm.
	
	
	Mr Brady acknowledges that it would necessitate directing the jury, if they were not satisfied of murder, to consider, first, whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter. If they were not satisfied of that, it is accepted as inevitable that they would return a verdict on the basis of criminal negligence.
	
	
	The Queen v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 was cited as the relevant authority. At p 379, in the joint judgment of a bench comprising five judges, it was said that:
	


“In our view, the following considerations should lead trial judges to refrain from asking a jury the basis of a verdict of manslaughter save in exceptional cases.”


	
	The judgment then proceeds to list seven considerations:
	


“First, to inform the jury, in the course of a summing-up, that they will later be invited to answer a question, or questions, as to the basis of the verdict, may distract them from their task of seeking unanimity on a general verdict, and provoke unnecessary confusion and disagreement as to the basis of the verdict.

Secondly, the jury's response to any such question may be unclear. A response that indicated two grounds of decision might, depending upon the circumstances, indicate that the jury were unanimous on both grounds, or that some jurors adopted one ground, and the remainder adopted another. The response may create more uncertainty than previously existed.

Thirdly, there may be various possible views of the evidence in a case; different jurors may adopt different views and yet, consistently with their directions, reach a common verdict. To invite them to refine their verdict may be productive of mischief.

Fourthly, there is a substantial risk that the jury will be invited to make a decision upon which they have not been properly addressed by counsel. The present case provides a good example. Trial counsel never addressed the jury on provocation. Rarely would defence counsel's address to a jury be expressed in terms appropriate to a plea in mitigation.

Fifthly, where there are two or more accused the jury might choose to answer the question with respect to one or more and not with respect to another or others. This would be invidious.      

Sixthly, the judge may be embarrassed if he or she does not agree with the jury's answer to the question.

Seventhly, where two or more partial defences are advanced, if the jury were to come to a conclusion favourable to an accused on the first defence they considered, they might not consider the other or others; if that occurred, an answer to the question might convey a false impression of having considered and rejected the other or others.”


	
	Of those seven considerations it seems to me that the first, second, third, sixth and seventh are relevant in the present case.
	
	
	It is understandable that Mr Brady would seek that I proceed in the manner I have outlined because he contends that the result might be significant in terms of sentence. It would involve either sentencing the accused for manslaughter solely on a criminal negligence basis, or possibly on the basis of both an unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter with the admitted failure to obtain medical attention.
	
	
	I am not sure that there is any great utility for the purpose of sentencing in knowing whether the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter in addition to the conceded criminal negligence manslaughter. On my understanding of the facts, culpability on either basis and perhaps both are likely to be found at a very high level and I say that on the basis of the starting point adopted for the sentence that Harrison J imposed upon Ms Kayla James, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter on a criminal negligence basis. His Honour's starting point was not far short of the maximum penalty.
	
	
	The things that concern me most about this proposal is that it is possible that the jury might be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt unanimously of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter and criminal negligence manslaughter, or unanimously only on criminal negligence manslaughter or some jurors might be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter whilst others were not, and unless I were to direct the jury to reason and to deliberate upon verdicts sequentially, some jurors might not see the need to consider both bases and would be content to return a verdict of manslaughter on the conceded basis of criminal negligence without needing to take the time to trouble themselves with unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter.
	
	
	Another difficulty is that if the jury were satisfied that they should return a verdict of not guilty of murder, the deliberations from that point would in the ordinary course not require much further deliberation because of the concession as to criminal negligence manslaughter. To have the jury grapple with a request that they decide whether they are unanimous as to unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter would be productive of possible disagreement, confusion, uncertainty and the like.
	
	
	For those reasons, I do not propose to accede to the request that I proceed in the fashion sought by Mr Brady.

		20 November 2015",2015-11-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768216,R v Armstrong [2015] NSWDC 363,"Judgment


	
	For a 21 year old, Danny Armstrong has a long criminal history. His record involves offences in the Children’s Court for driving, break, enter and steal, stalking, having a knife in custody, goods in custody, car theft and affray. As an adult he has been sentenced in the Local Court for common assault, malicious damage, contravening an apprehended violence order and, again, stalking. All of those offences are relatively less serious than the very serious offences that I am sentencing him for today.
	
	
	He has pleaded guilty to two offences and I convict him of the two offences that he has pleaded guilty to. I should say what they are. The first is an aggravated break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence. The serious indictable offence is assault occasioning actual bodily harm. When I am sentencing him for that offence he has asked me to take into account another offence which is being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence. I will take that into account and I sign a certificate to that effect. That certificate is MFI 1. The second offence that I am sentencing Danny Armstrong for is using an offensive weapon with intent to prevent arrest.
	
	
	The first offence is against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Parliament regards that offence as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment. Not only that, Parliament has fixed a standard non-parole period of five years to that crime. Technically, that standard non-parole period is not relevant to the sentence because Mr Armstrong has pleaded guilty. He has pleaded guilty at what the prosecution agrees is the earliest available opportunity and in due course, I will discount his sentences by 25%.
	
	
	Returning to the offences, the second one - using an offensive weapon with intent to prevent arrest by the police - is a crime against s 33B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. That is so serious that Parliament has fixed a maximum of 12 years imprisonment to that crime.
	
	
	A judge needs to say what happened that resulted in an offender being charged before fixing the sentence. That is so that the judge can make an assessment of how serious an example the particular crime is of that offence.
	
	
	These offences occurred on 1 January 2015. The victim was a woman who used to be the partner of Danny Armstrong. She herself had some five children and lived in Cowra with her mother. Although the relationship had ended in December last year, Mr Armstrong used to stay at her place on occasions. They went out together on 1 January this year. They went to a gathering down by the riverbank in Cowra, including going out onto the water. The victim of his crime left at about five. She went home and went to bed at about half-past-nine that night. Three of her children were at home with her and her mother was in another room. Some of her children were watching TV.
	
	
	Shortly after she went to bed the woman woke “to see the accused in her room”. He started yelling at her about “having another man”. I am quoting from the agreed facts. The victim told Danny Armstrong to leave or she would call the police. Sensibly, at that stage, he left. He ran into her mother in the kitchen but then he left the house. The women went to bed again.
	
	
	About an hour later Danny Armstrong came back to the house. He partially removed a seal on the back door and he got in. One of the victim’s children, a 13 year old, ran into the victim’s room telling her there was someone in the backyard. She woke up and again saw Danny Armstrong in her bedroom. He punched her to the nose and to the mouth. She got out of bed and ran towards the front door but Danny Armstrong ran after her. He grabbed her shirt, he pushed her and she hit her head on the wall. Her mother tried to intervene but the woman had been injured already. Her teeth and lips were cut.
	
	
	Danny Armstrong did not stop at that. He went to the kitchen and got a knife from the drawer. He then chased the victim. She ran outside and hid behind a car. She then went back into the house and locked the door. She rang the police. She heard him shouting outside “I will stab you and cut my throat and would stab myself and we’d see who would have the last laugh”. Then what Danny Armstrong did was to smash the window in the lounge room with the knife.
	
	
	Fortunately, the police had arrived. Senior Constable Buchtman was in the police car. He opened his door to deal with the situation. Danny Armstrong “then raised his right hand above his shoulder and moved it towards the officer in a slashing motion”. Senior Constable Buchtman “was forced to lean backwards to avoid being hit by the knife”. He sensibly got back into his car. Danny Armstrong “again raised the knife above his shoulder”. Then a second officer used his taser to subdue Danny Armstrong who eventually dropped the knife. He was put under arrest, saying to the police “Fuck you cunts, you dog cunts, I’ll kill you”.
	
	
	It goes without saying that these are very serious crimes.
	
	
	Danny Armstrong has a criminal record. I have listed the kinds of offences that are on his criminal record. As I said, they include intimidation and having custody of a knife. He also has convictions for damaging property.
	
	
	Danny Armstrong was represented by Mr P Johnson at his sentence proceedings. Mr Johnson called his client to give evidence. Danny Armstrong grew up in Campbelltown and moved to Cowra about two years ago. He has a little girl called Mia, who is now about two and-a-half. Mr Armstrong is not in contact with Mia’s mother. Danny Armstrong had a relationship, as I said, with the victim of the present crimes. She has, herself, six children from a previous relationship. They are no longer together. The little girl is in the care of Family and Community Services.
	
	
	When he leaves gaol, Mr Armstrong wants to go to live in Liverpool where his mother lives and to develop a better relationship with his mother, obtain employment and look after his daughter.
	
	
	Whilst he has been in custody since his arrest on 1 January this year he has been working in the gaol and undertaking Aboriginal Studies. He has also been doing TAFE courses in cottons and synthetics until he had to move. He is also in the course of completing a Warehousing Certificate 2. He identifies as Indigenous and as a Kamilaroi man.
	
	
	Danny Armstrong acknowledged alcohol and drug issues which are raised in his presentence report but had ceased using them before he went into custody. In fact, he said he handed himself in regarding some outstanding warrants. The outstanding warrants concern no fewer than three good behaviour bonds that he was serving at the time of these offences.
	
	
	Danny Armstrong regrets what he has done. I accept that he is genuinely remorseful and he is prepared to accept his punishment. Asked by Mr Johnson, he said that if he had had the opportunity he would apologise to the victims of his offences. He hopes in the foreseeable future to have stable accommodation and a job so he can look after his daughter.
	
	
	Cross-examined by Ms T Hennessy, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, Danny Armstrong acknowledged that he was drinking a lot at the time and that he was socialising with the victim that afternoon. He denied punching her in the face that night, but the agreed facts indicate that he did.
	
	
	Danny Armstrong acknowledged that alcohol is a problem and that he wishes to change his habits. He acknowledged that he needs help. When he was on parole, he had thought that he would be all right but, as he said, “obviously I am not”. He had been forced into detox by the time in gaol and has stopped using drugs. He had been taking cannabis at an early stage but gave up and went cold‑turkey in the middle of last year. He acknowledged that he had probably been jealous and aggressive when he had too much to drink on 1 January this year. He would be prepared to take a residential rehabilitation course if the opportunity arose.
	
	
	There is a presentence report about Danny Armstrong. It acknowledges his participation in study and courses whilst he has been in custody. It said that he was “cooperative and forthcoming with information pertaining to this report and appeared to display some insight into his offending”. That is consistent with my own observations. I thought similarly when I heard him give evidence. However, the author also realistically acknowledged that Danny Armstrong is assessed at a medium risk of re-offending. The author was in touch with his mother who expected that she would make contact with him again once he was released.
	
	
	Danny Armstrong apparently left home at the age of 12 and was essentially homeless for a period of time. He had behavioural problems at school and finished his education in year 10 but, as I said, has undertaken studies whilst in custody. It noted his early engagement in prohibited substances and alcohol. It noted his good behaviour bonds and the fact that he was in breach of those.
	
	
	In his submissions for his client, Mr Johnson said that the alcohol problem was more of a context for the offending. He did not suggest it was mitigating and he was realistic in acknowledging that. Mr Johnson argued that the offence of the aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence was fairly serious but at the low end of seriousness. Ms Hennessy, on the other hand, argued that it was in the middle of the range.
	
	
	I agree with Ms Hennessy. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it cannot fall below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Not only did it involve an assault occasioning actual bodily harm on a victim, it was committed in her home in the presence of her children who were there or nearby. It involved corporeal violence and it was committed whilst Danny Armstrong was meant to be on good behaviour. In other words, a court had released him instead of sending him to gaol on condition that he behave himself.
	
	
	The offence committed against the police officer, Ms Hennessy argued, was extremely serious. But for the evasive action taken by the police officer, he may have been seriously injured. It was, Ms Hennessy argued, a serious example of that kind of offence, but not towards the upper end. I think she is right in that submission.
	
	
	I do take into account Mr Johnson’s submission that there had been no planning and that it had been spontaneous. But that must be tempered by the fact that Mr Armstrong came back a second time and on the second occasion committed the offences. Mr Johnson realistically acknowledged the importance of general deterrence, although his client was relatively young.
	
	
	Mr Johnson pointed out his client’s early plea, which was not only valuable because of the time it saves for the courts, but also an indication of remorse. I accept that submission. I also agree that most of his client’s criminal record were offences dealt with by the Children’s Court when he was much younger and immature.
	
	
	Danny Armstrong will settle away from the Cowra district where the trouble occurred and will stay with his mother and stepfather. Mr Johnson confirmed that his mother and stepfather have, in fact, been in touch with him by phone. I accept that he will be received into that environment eventually.
	
	
	Addressing the rehabilitation potential, Mr Johnson argued that there was some potential because of his client’s young age. On the other hand, I do not regard those rehabilitation prospects as good; one must be realistic. I agree with Ms Hennessy’s submission that they would be, nevertheless, reasonable. The fact that he has undertaken courses and employment within custody is a very good sign.
	
	
	I agree with Mr Johnson that his client’s evidence was cogent and he appeared to be honest regarding his evidence. Mr Johnson submitted that there are special circumstances for adjusting what is the normal ratio between a head sentence and a non-parole period. Normally a non-parole period is 75% of the head sentence. Ms Hennessy acknowledged the same. Danny Armstrong will need intervention to settle back into the community. His rehabilitation will continue outside the gaol. He is also relatively young and the less exposure he has to other people in custody, the better. He will need rehabilitation to avoid relapse.
	
	
	Ms Hennessy emphasised the seriousness of the crime that I am taking into account in sentencing him for the aggravated break and enter. The main offence is domestic violence related and there is an important aspect of general deterrence to take into account in that regard.
	
	
	Mr Armstrong was sentenced for another offence and his sentence was four months, from 8 July this year to 7 November this year. On one view I could date his present sentence from a date later than 1 January because of the time being served for that other offence. I do not propose to do that for this reason. I will be imposing a significant sentence on Mr Armstrong. On the other hand, he is at a young age. I am going to give him the benefit of not having to commence that significant sentence later than when he was arrested for this offence. I do appreciate that it means that he effectively serves no sentence for the other crime but I am going to do that primarily because of his age.
	
	
	I come now to the appropriate sentences. Given that I find that the aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence was in the middle of the range of objective seriousness and I am taking into account a serious other offence, normally I would regard a sentence of some nine years imprisonment as appropriate. But, given Mr Armstrong’s youth and his reasonable rehabilitation prospects I am going to fix the sentence for that first offence as seven years imprisonment.
	
	
	I would normally regard an appropriate penalty for the second offence of using the offensive weapon towards the police as five and-a-half years imprisonment, but for the same reasons I would regard an appropriate penalty in Mr Armstrong’s case as being four and-a-half years imprisonment.
	
	
	However, as I said earlier, Mr Armstrong has pleaded guilty at what is agreed was the earliest available opportunity. I would, therefore, discount those respective sentences of seven years and four and-a-half years by 25%. That means that the sentence I would have imposed for the aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, taking into account the other offence, would be five years and three months imprisonment. It also means that the sentence I would have imposed regarding using the knife towards the police officer, after the 25% discount, would be three years and four months imprisonment.
	
	
	I would regard it as appropriate because they were distinct crimes with distinct victims - both very serious crimes - to accumulate the sentences by 12 months. In other words, the overall sentence that I would have imposed would have been six years and three months imprisonment, having accumulated the two penalties by 12 months.
	
	
	Normally for a sentence of six years and three months a non‑parole period would be 75% of that. That would be four years and eight months. However, I would be prepared, in this case, to reduce the non-parole period to four years because of the special circumstances referred to by Mr Johnson and Ms Hennessy that I related earlier.
	
	
	What I will do instead of imposing those individual sentences and accumulating them, is to fix one aggregate sentence covering both of the crimes and the aggregate sentence will be six years and three months and the non parole period will be four years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	I sentence you to an aggregate sentence - one sentence - of six years and three months imprisonment. It commenced when you were arrested for this offence on 1 January 2015, it will expire on 31 March 2021. I fix a non‑parole period of four years. That commenced on 1 January 2015 and it will expire on 31 December 2018. The first date on which you will be eligible for parole is 31 December 2018.
	


HIS HONOUR: Do you understand?

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Have a seat. Now, Mr Johnson, Ms Hennessy, I’m pretty sure the sums are right but take your time and let me know--

HENNESSY: The bonds?

HIS HONOUR: Yeah, I should deal with those too but let’s just do the sums, first.

JOHNSON: As you were delivering your remarks on sentence I was scratching out the sums and I agree with your Honour’s calculation.

HIS HONOUR: The sums are right, okay. Ms Hennessy? Take your time.

HENNESSY: I’m putting it into my calculator. Yes.

HIS HONOUR: They all right?

HENNESSY: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Now, I haven’t heard either of you about the--

HENNESSY: Considering the sentence--

HIS HONOUR: I’m thinking considering the sentence that I’d decide to take no action.

JOHNSON: Thank you.

HENNESSY: I wouldn’t be heard against that. There’s one other thing--

HIS HONOUR: Right, just let me make that order:


	
	In respect of the three breaches of the good behaviour bonds I am satisfied that Mr Armstrong failed to comply with the conditions of the three good behaviour bonds and, in each case, under s 98(2)(a) I decide to take no action with respect to those failures to comply.
	


HIS HONOUR: Yes, Ms Hennessy?

HENNESSY: Upon committal there was a 166 certificate. There was a common assault charge which was a backup to the aggravated break and enter charge and I’d ask for that to be withdrawn as a backup offence.

JOHNSON: I confirm that.


	
	The back-up offence of common assault is withdrawn and dismissed.
	


HENNESSY: I have the 166 if your associate needs it.

HIS HONOUR: Okay, anything else? Mr Johnson, Ms Hennessy?

JOHNSON: Not from me.

HENNESSY: No.

HIS HONOUR: Danny Armstrong, you’ve received a significant sentence and that’s because - you’ve heard the reasons I gave – because of just how serious the crimes were that you’ve committed. Very serious. You’ve got to do your time for that which I think you understand, for those crimes. Your overall sentence, as I said, six years and three months and I’ve backdated it to 1 January. I could have backdated it less than that. Because of your age, I’ve decided to commence it back then; so, your overall sentence doesn’t expire until 31 March 2021. You’ve got a non-parole period of four years. Now, that could have been as high as four years and eight months, five years, but I’ve reduced it to four years. That will expire on 31 December, New Years Eve, 2018 and you are eligible for release then. That depends on the Parole Authority, you understand that don’t you?

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Right, is there anything else?

HENNESSY: No.

JOHNSON: No.

HIS HONOUR: All right, well, keep up the good work you’re doing in custody and good luck from here on.

OFFENDER: Thank you, your Honour.

		10 February 2016",2015-11-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768224,Plaisted v R [2015] NSWCCA 287,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: In circumstances sufficiently explained by R S Hulme AJ, the applicant was sentenced on 20 May 2013 for two offences involving knowing participation in the supply of not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. Count 1 involved an amount of approximately 22kg of methylamphetamine; count 2 involved a little over 1kg of heroin.
	
	
	Because the transaction involving the heroin took place on the same date as one transaction involving methylamphetamine, the sentence on count 2 was wholly concurrent with the sentence imposed for count 1. As it involved a non-parole period of two years imprisonment, with a further term of two years, it is (and will remain) wholly subsumed within the sentence on count 1. It was not apparent from the notice of appeal, or the submissions in support of the appeal, that any challenge was raised as to the sentence on count 2. It may be assumed that there was no application for leave to appeal against that sentence.
	
	
	With respect to the sentence on count 1, there was no suggestion that the maximum term (life imprisonment) would have been available, or should have any marked relationship with the sentence imposed on the applicant. Nevertheless, the relevant table to Pt 4, Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“Sentencing Procedure Act”) prescribes a standard non-parole period of 15 years. That guideline is of limited assistance in respect of an offence of knowing participation in supply of a prohibited (drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW)) because of the wide range of conduct which can be caught by such an offence. There will often be (as there was in this case) a need to take into account sentences imposed on other offenders involved in the same criminal activity.
	
	
	The potential variety of the conduct caught by such an offence also renders the sentencing statistics for this offence less helpful than usual.
	
	
	As more fully explained by R S Hulme AJ, the sentencing judge (Garling ADCJ) gave careful attention to the sentence imposed on a co-offender, AMZ, which had been upheld on appeal by this Court: AMZ v R [2013] NSWCCA 6. Although both were intimately involved in the course of criminal conduct, the relevant comparison demonstrated more elements of difference than of similarity. The sentencing judge appropriately accepted that the overall culpability of the applicant was well below that of AMZ. His starting point was thus 19 years, as compared with 29 years for AMZ. (The sentence was then reduced by 25% for an early guilty plea.) Rounding down, the result was a sentence of 14 years imprisonment. Applying the statutory formula set out in s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, the judge noted that the result would be a non-parole period of 10.5 years. Given his finding of special circumstances, that was reduced to 9 years with a balance of term of 5 years.
	
	
	Ground 1 of the proposed appeal asserted that the sentencing judge had erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicant’s role in the offending. That ground depended on three factors.
	
	
	First, reference was made to the apparent confusion in the language used by the sentencing judge, referring to the offender’s role as both “substantial” and as “a minor one.” I agree with Wilson J and would place no weight on this factor. The reference to the role being minor occurred as a comparison with the role of the principal who, it was suggested, might enjoy “enormous profits” and live a “luxury lifestyle”. There was no suggestion that the applicant enjoyed such benefits.
	
	
	Secondly, there was the language by which the judge assessed the role of the applicant in relation to AMZ. It was submitted that, whilst differences were noted, the overall assessment suggested a degree of equivalence which was not warranted by the facts. AMZ undoubtedly played a far more significant role, as personal assistant to the principal, than did the applicant. There is substance to this criticism, although taken alone it should be approached with caution.
	
	
	The third element involved the numerical starting points for the sentence calculations. This was an important consideration because AMZ obtained a major discount for assistance provided to the authorities which prevented any useful comparison between the sentences actually imposed. Apart from the difference in their respective roles, allowance had also to be made for an additional course of conduct undertaken by AMZ, in which the applicant was not involved and which involved a further 6kg of methylamphetamine. It was suggested that the 29 year starting point for AMZ should be reduced by some five years to account for the additional criminal conduct. If that were done, the equivalent starting point for AMZ was 24 years, to be compared with 19 years with respect to the applicant. On that approach, the applicant received a sentence equating his culpability to 80% of that of AMZ. That disparity, it was submitted, was inadequate.
	
	
	The second and third factors in combination demonstrate that the exercise of discretion miscarried in this case. It follows that the sentence imposed was excessive and should be reduced. I agree with the orders proposed by R S Hulme AJ.
	
	
	WILSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence imposed upon him in the District Court of New South Wales on 20 May 2013. Despite the passing of almost two and a half years since the date on which sentence was passed, the application has been made within the extended time allowed to the applicant by the Registrar. The application is brought pursuant to s.5 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	If granted leave, the applicant seeks to advance two grounds of appeal against the sentence imposed upon him, being:
	



	
	The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicant’s role in the offending; and
	
	
	The sentence is manifestly excessive.
	



	
	The general facts of the applicant’s crimes and of his personal circumstances have been set out in the judgment of RS Hulme AJ. His Honour concluded that both grounds have been made out. I do not agree with that conclusion and make the following, relatively brief, comments.
	


Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicant’s role in the offending


	
	The applicant’s complaint relies upon a needlessly semantic reading of the judgment of the sentencing judge which considers sentences or phrases extracted from the judgment in isolation of the context in which the relevant portion was made. On the basis of that approach it is contended that his Honour’s remarks were “neither accurate nor consistent” in the way that the applicant’s offending conduct was assessed.
	
	
	The foundation of the applicant’s complaint is, in large part, two remarks by the sentencing judge which, when divorced from their original context, give the appearance of inconsistency. At p9 of his judgment (“ROS”), his Honour said,
	


“In reality, this offender’s role, as with the other man, was a minor one.”


	
	At p10 of ROS,
	


“He played a substantial role in this syndicate.”


	
	Whilst these comments may give the appearance of inconsistency when extracted as discrete sentences, viewed in context there is no inconsistency. The first of the sentences considered the applicant’s role as against the principal of the syndicate, a man described by his Honour as a charismatic individual who moved in a world awash with money and luxury. When compared to the role of the principal, there was no error in categorising the one as major and the other minor.
	
	
	His Honour was clearly at pains to consider the role of the applicant as compared not just to the principal, but to the other offenders sentenced for their respective roles in it. The use of differing assessments of the applicant’s criminality comes about as part of that exercise. It should be unsurprising that an offender’s role may be expressed to be a minor one in comparison with one offender, but more significant when compared with the role of another, lesser, offender, or when considered as a whole.
	
	
	The second of the sentences extracted by the applicant from his Honour’s remarks was an expression of the applicant’s overall role in the syndicate in which he was knowingly involved, and represented his Honour’s assessment of the applicant’s criminality having taken all relevant features into account. In my opinion the conclusion of the sentencing judge, that the applicant’s overall role in the syndicate was a significant one, was well open on the evidence before the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The applicant played a role of considerable importance in what was a high level criminal syndicate involved in the inter-state distribution and sale of large amounts of prohibited drugs. He used his knowledge of and expertise and contacts in the field of interstate truck transport to move large amounts of the type of amphetamine known as “ice”, and heroin. The applicant did this for no other motivation than greed.
	
	
	I do not consider the assessment made by the sentencing judge of the applicant’s role in the commission of these very serious offences as either inconsistent or inaccurate. His remarks when read as a whole, as they should be, represent a reasoned and fair assessment.
	
	
	I would not grant leave to advance this ground.
	


Ground 2: The sentence is manifestly excessive


	
	This ground relies upon an assertion that the sentencing judge was wrongly influenced by the sentence imposed upon another of the co-offenders, known as AMZ, and as a consequence imposed a sentence which was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The applicant contends that his role was a much lesser one than that of AMZ, and it was wrong to use the sentence imposed upon AMZ as a “starting point” in calculating that imposed upon him.
	
	
	Parity was an important consideration when determining the sentence to be imposed upon the applicant. As noted when considering ground 1, the sentencing judge was cognisant of the importance of the principle of parity, and made a careful assessment of the applicant’s role in the commission of the offences, which he compared to the roles of the other offenders, each of whom had already been sentenced. In giving consideration to the circumstances relating to the co-offenders, his Honour was doing no more than he was obliged to do.
	
	
	The applicant’s role was assessed as falling below that of AMZ, who acted as a “personal assistant” to the principal, and whose role was more extensive than that of the applicant. Insofar as the sentencing judge had regard to the sentence imposed upon AMZ (and upheld by this Court in AMZ v R [2013] NSWCCA 6) when determining the sentence to be imposed upon the applicant, it was in accordance with the principles set out in Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462.
	
	
	The applicant relies upon sentencing statistics derived from the Judicial Information Research System to support his claim that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was wrongly inflated. By reference to statistics for the period October 2007 to September 2014 (referable to 16 individuals) the applicant argues that the fact that only he and AMZ received sentences in excess of 12 years is indicative of error.
	
	
	Such an argument must be rejected. Statistics can say nothing about the exercise of the sentencing discretion in a particular case, and whether that discretion has miscarried. Statistics may demonstrate the range of sentences imposed relative to a particular offence in a given period, but they cannot demonstrate why a particular sentence within that range was fixed as it was.
	
	
	The range of sentence against which an individual case is most appropriately measured is that set by the maximum penalty specified for the relevant offence; in this instance, the maximum penalty for each of the applicant’s tow crimes was life imprisonment. The other relevant yardstick is the standard non-parole period (SNPP); here a period of 15 years imprisonment: Koh v R [2013] NSWCCA 287.
	
	
	When viewed against the maximum penalty of life imprisonment, and the substantial SNPP that applied, the sentence imposed upon the applicant is in no way extraordinary.
	
	
	In my opinion the sentence imposed upon the applicant was neither unreasonable nor unjust: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54: (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [325]. The sentencing discretion is a broad one, as stated in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [27]:
	


“Express legislative provisions apart, neither principle, nor any of the grounds of appellate review, dictates the particular path that a sentencer, passing sentence in a case where the penalty is not fixed by statute, must follow in reasoning to the conclusion that the sentence to be imposed should be fixed as it is. The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached. As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies.”


	
	Here, the sentencing judge gave careful attention to considerations of parity; he assessed the objective gravity of the applicant’s crime, and gave proper weight to the applicant’s subjective circumstances. Favourably to the applicant, he made a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s.44 (2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, reducing the non-parole period below that otherwise dictated by statute; and he allowed complete concurrency of sentence for the two sentences in circumstances where – contrary to the applicant’s assertion – it was open to him to conclude that the criminality of one offence was not wholly reflected by the sentence imposed for the other.
	
	
	I do not regard error as having been established and I would not grant leave to argue this ground.
	
	
	RS HULME AJ: On 20 May 2013, the above named Applicant for leave to appeal was sentenced by Garling ADCJ in respect of two charges of knowingly take part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of drugs. One offence involved the supply of 21.807 kilograms of methylamphetamine (“ice”) between 26 November 2010 and 15 February 2011 and in respect of that offence, the sentence imposed was imprisonment for 14 years including a non-parole period of 9 years, both such periods commencing on 5 May 2011.
	
	
	The second charge involved the supply of 1.05 kilograms of heroin on 17 December 2010. In respect of that offence he was sentenced to imprisonment for four years including a non-parole period of two years, both such periods also dating from 5 May 2011.
	
	
	The maximum period of imprisonment prescribed for each of the Applicant’s offences is imprisonment for life. A standard non parole period of 15 years has been prescribed.
	
	
	The circumstances of the Applicant’s offending were that a syndicate would source substantial amounts of ice and heroin in Sydney, arrange for those drugs to be transported to Perth and cash from the sale of the drugs in Perth to be then transported back to Sydney. The principal of the syndicate appears to have been a man Yazdani. Another person, AMZ, fulfilled the role of Yazdani’s personal assistant. The role of the Applicant, who was an employee of Watsons Express Transport, was to arrange the transportation of drugs from Sydney to Perth. Communication between the offenders was commonly via “Phantom Secure” Blackberry mobile phones.
	
	
	On 26 November 2010, an employee of Watsons Express Transport attended the McDonald’s restaurant at Revesby in a car registered to the Applicant’s wife in order to take delivery of a lockable “Tuff Case”. When it became apparent that the Tuff Case did not fit into the boot of the Applicant’s wife’s car, the Watsons Express Transport employee swapped cars with AMZ. Later that day the Applicant assisted in placing the Tuff Case into a Watsons Express Transport truck and drove it to the Yagoona rail yard where, together with other contents of the truck, the Tuff Case was loaded onto a train bound for Perth. The drugs involved in this operation, forming part of the quantity encompassed by the first charge, were 6 kilograms of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	On 17 December 2010, a waterproof yachting bag was forwarded to Watsons Express Depot by AMZ. There the Applicant took the package to the Tasfreight Depot from where it was transported to Melbourne. The Applicant arranged for a truck driver to pick up AMZ in Melbourne and drive him to Perth after collecting the bag from the Tasfreight Depot. The drugs involved on this occasion were 6 kilograms of methylamphetamine also forming part of the quantity encompassed by the first charge and 1.05 kilograms of heroin, the drugs the subject of the second charge.
	
	
	On 15 February 2011, at the request of Yazdani, the Applicant arranged for a truck to attend and pick up two suitcases from a residence in Bondi. Sometime later the truck was stopped by police and the suitcases confiscated. The drugs involved on this occasion, and forming the balance of those the subject of the first charge, were 11.4 kilograms of methylamphetamine. (The individual quantities do not total the 21.807 kilograms which was the quantity with which the Applicant was said to be involved. However, in the circumstances of the case, the difference does not matter.)
	
	
	It was not suggested that the Applicant knew of the weights of each of the parcels although he knew that each exceeded 1 kilogram. Nor was it suggested that the Applicant knew there were two different drugs involved on 17 December 2010. His Honour however concluded that the Applicant had a lot more knowledge of the drugs and the amount of drugs than he was prepared to admit.
	
	
	The Applicant was arrested on 5 May 2011. Prior to the subject offences, he had a minor criminal record in Western Australia, New South Wales and South Australia for offences of stealing, driving with a mid-range PCA and failing to adhere to the limits on driving hours.
	
	
	Turning to subjective matters, the Applicant was born in 1981. The sentencing judge accepted that he had a very difficult upbringing. He started using illegal drugs at age 11 or 12 and alcohol shortly thereafter. He became and continued to be a heavy drinker until his arrest in 2011. He gambled heavily. He commenced work at age 15 and, because he was effectively his own boss, was in virtually continuous employment until his arrest.
	
	
	It is not clear when the Applicant’s drug use stopped. He told the author of a Pre-Sentence Report that it had stopped when his daughter, said to be 8 in 2011, was born. Elsewhere he is said to have been under the influence of drugs at the time of some of the conversations incidental to the drug dealing the subject of the charge.
	
	
	The evidence as to the Applicant’s remuneration was conflicting. At one stage the Applicant said that he was promised $2,500 per load, but paid less. At another he indicated that he had managed to pay off a very substantial debt. However, the Applicant had none of the trappings of wealth. He, and his wife and daughter, were living in part of the Watsons Transport Company premises the Applicant had adapted for the purposes. Subsequent to his arrest his wife of some 7 years left him, taking their daughter interstate. Garling ACDJ recorded that the Applicant had realised that the abuse of drugs and alcohol had wasted his life.
	
	
	The Applicant pleaded guilty to both charges and was held entitled to a 25% discount for doing so. His Honour found special circumstances.
	
	
	The Applicant’s grounds of appeal were:
	



	
	The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the Applicant’s role in the offending.
	
	
	The sentence is manifestly excessive.
	


Ground 1


	
	The above account of the Applicant’s offending is taken from an Agreed Statement of Facts and reflects what, according to the evidence, the Applicant did. Garling ADCJ’s characterisation of the Applicant’s role is not so clear. His Honour certainly did recognise the existence of differences between the offenders, remarking, inter alia, that the starting point for the sentences imposed on AMZ was 29 years while that in respect of the Applicant’s sentence was 19 years. However, other passages give cause for concern that the recognition was not adequate, particularly when regard is had also to the fact that AMZ faced an extra charge and the differences in roles.
	
	
	At various stages through his remarks on sentence his Honour observed:
	


The offender’s role was to arrange transport of the drugs from Sydney to Perth. The facts supplied to me show that AMZ played a substantial role in the syndicate. – AB 11.9

… AMZ is more involved in this syndicate than the offender. They both play an important role but AMZ played the greater part … - AB 12.5

I borrow from what his Honour, Judge Berman said in part as it mirrors what I need to say. That AMZ and, indeed in this case, the offender did it for money. He was only seduced by an older and more charismatic person who introduced him into a world in which enormous sums of money and large quantities of drugs were packaged and transported across the country so that enormous profits could be made and luxury lifestyles could be lived. In reality this offender’s role, as with the other man, was a minor one. – AB 13.8

He [the Applicant] played a substantial role in this syndicate. It was not the role of one who would be unaware of some of the details. – AB 14.9


	
	It is impossible to reconcile his Honour’s descriptions of the Applicant’s role as “minor” and “substantial”.
	
	
	Furthermore, there can be no doubt that his Honour’s remarks reflect a most unusual degree of attention to AMZ. They also display an equating of the situations of AMZ and the Applicant that was not always justified. Thus in passages from his Honour’s remarks set out above, while reference is made to AMZ having a greater role, the terms “substantial” and “minor” role” are applied to both.
	
	
	In fact AMZ’s role was very substantially greater than the Applicant’s. In sentencing AMZ, Berman DCJ remarked that while AMZ acted at the direction of others and did not exercising any independent judgment, his role was much higher in the hierarchy than a mere courier. His activities included:-
	


AMZ drove Mr Yazdani around while the latter was engaged in drug dealing;

AMZ tested drugs for Mr Yazdani;

AMZ bought containers in which to package drugs, was present when drugs were packaged and assisted in that regard;

He assisted in the cutting of drugs;

He collected and transported drugs;

He was sent to Perth to recover drugs that seemed to have become mislaid, succeeding in this endeavour;

He transported large amounts of cash, on one occasion at least, $500,000 from Perth to Sydney;

He disguised himself and rented premises to be used as a safe house.


	
	The Applicant’s role was far less. I doubt if it can be summed up in one word. It was significant in that transport of the drugs to Perth was an essential element in the operation. However, the Applicant’s activities were no more than that and did not merit the description “substantial role in this syndicate”.
	
	
	In the result, Ground 1 is made out.
	


Ground 2


	
	Although not strictly within the terms of this ground, a substantial component of the argument in respect of it – and an argument responded to by the Crown – was that Garling ADCJ was induced to impose too high a sentence on the Applicant in consequence of the attention his Honour gave to the sentence that had been imposed on AMZ and his Honour’s desire to achieve parity between the two offenders and a failure to give sufficient recognition to the differences between their respective situations.
	
	
	To some degree I have dealt with this aspect when considering the first ground. But the failure is also apparent when his Honour came to reflect on the offenders’ subjective circumstances. His Honour remarked “both had similar difficulties in the past”. That statement did not reflect his Honour’s earlier statement that the Applicant “had a very difficult upbringing… He started using illegal drugs at eleven or twelve years of age. He started to use alcohol and did not stop using drugs and alcohol until he went into custody” and what Berman DCJ had said of AMZ, “He had a good upbringing by parents who loved and supported him”.
	
	
	I do not ignore the fact that AMZ seems to have had other problems and seems to have fallen out with his parents not long before, or perhaps after, his offending. However, there was no basis for Garling ADCJ’s statement that “both had similar difficulties in the past”.
	
	
	AMZ was also sentenced in respect of 6 offences, compared to the Applicant’s two. AMZ’s offences were:-
	


(i)   Participating in a criminal group.

(ii)   Supplying 6 kilograms of ice.

(iii)   Supplying another 6 kilograms of ice.

(iv)   Supplying a large commercial quantity of heroin.

(v)   Supplying a third 6 kilograms of ice.

(vi)   Supplying 11.4 kilograms of ice.


	
	The drugs, the subject of the third to sixth charges were those which were also the subject of the charges against the Applicant. Understandably the first offence was not regarded as increasing AMZ’s criminality but the second offence, with which the Applicant was not concerned, certainly did so.
	
	
	But the ground of appeal was that the sentence was manifestly excessive, not that there was a lack of parity. While the matters to which I have so far referred might explain any excess that exists in the sentence, the issue remains whether there was manifest excess.
	
	
	In light of my conclusion in respect of the first ground, I do not need to decide this question. In Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601 the High Court decided that once relevant error was shown it became the duty of this Court to form its own view as to a proper sentence. Error has been shown and accordingly I proceed as the High Court dictated.
	
	
	In that independent assessment I would not impose a sentence as great as Garling ADCJ did. Certainly the quantity with which the Applicant was involved calls for a substantial sentence but the limited nature of his role, the fact that it is impossible to conclude that he derived any large profits from his participation, and his, in Garling ADCJ’s words, “very difficult upbringing”, lead me to the conclusion that the appropriate sentence is one including a non-parole period of 7 years with a balance of term of 4 years.
	
	
	I make it clear that in so concluding I have used as yardsticks or guides the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period that Parliament has provided. I have also taken into account Garling ADCJ’s finding of special circumstances and the reasons that led to that finding. Those factors still exist and justify a similar finding by this Court.
	
	
	Accordingly, the orders I propose are:
	


(i)   Grant leave to appeal;

(ii)   Allow the appeal;

(iii)   Quash the sentence imposed by Garling ADCJ;

(iv)   Sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 7 years commencing on 5 May 2011 together with a balance of term of 4 years commencing on 5 May 2018.

(v)   Record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that the Applicant will become for eligible for parole, 5 May 2018.

		19 November 2015",2015-11-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2768238,R v Christopher Phillip Cranney; R v Huy Bao Van Huynh [2015] NSWDC 276,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	By an indictment dated 8 April 2015 the Director of Public Prosecutions of the Commonwealth of Australia charged that Christopher Phillip Cranney committed two offences of conspiring with others to import pseudoephedrine in a commercial quantity. The conspiracy charged by count 1 was alleged to have existed in the period 1 September 2011 to 31 December 2011. The conspiracy charged in count 2 was alleged to have existed in the period 1 January 2012 to 30 June 2012. In addition, Mr Cranney was charged with three counts of dishonestly agreeing to receive or obtain a benefit for himself, namely money, with the intention that the exercise of his duties as a Commonwealth public official would be influenced. These were counts 3, 4 and 5 on the indictment.
	
	
	By the same indictment the Director charged that Huy Bao Van Huynh, participated in the conspiracy the subject of count 2 on the indictment.
	
	
	Following a trial, which commenced before a jury and me on 13 April 2015, on 9 June 2015 the jury found Mr Cranney not guilty of counts 1 and 3 and guilty of counts 2, 4 and 5. Mr Huynh was also found guilty of count 2.
	
	
	Both those offenders appear today for sentence, following a sentence hearing on 25 September 2015.
	
	
	Both offenders are to be sentenced in respect of one count of conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of border controlled precursor, being pseudoephedrine, between 1 January 2012 and 30 June 2012. The maximum penalty prescribed for this offence is 25 years imprisonment and/or 5,000 penalty units ($850,000).
	
	
	In addition, Mr Cranney is to be sentenced in respect of the two counts of dishonestly agreeing to receive or obtain a benefit for himself, namely money, with the intention that the exercise of his duties as a Commonwealth public official would be influenced, one count relating to the period about 1 January 2012 to about 31 March 2012 and the other to the period about 1 April 2012 to about 30 June 2012. The maximum penalty prescribed for these offences, which are also known as the offence of bribery of a Commonwealth official, is 10 years imprisonment and/or 10,000 penalty units ($1,700,000).
	
	
	The offences for which the offenders are to be sentenced arise out of criminal conduct engaged in by corrupt Customs officers and a corrupt baggage handler working at the Sydney International Airport (SIA), all of whom abused their positions and participated in importing into Australia substantial quantities of pseudoephedrine, some of which was intercepted, some of which was not.
	
	
	The Customs officers involved in the count 2 combination were Adrian Lamella, Paul Valsamakis and Mr Cranney. Within Customs, Mr Cranney was the most senior of the three. The baggage handler who was a part of the combination was a friend of Lamella’s, David Harb, who then worked for a baggage handling business operating at SIA called ‘Menzies Aviation’. The other participants included Bruno Napoli, an associate of Lamella, and Mr Huynh, who was an associate of Napoli. There were also 7 couriers used to effect the importations.
	
	
	The three Customs officers worked in various roles at SIA where their primary responsibilities included the detection and prevention of illegal cross border activity. For this purpose, each of the Customs officers, as required by their duties, had access to the various intelligence and investigative systems at SIA operated by what was then known as the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS).
	
	
	Around the start of 2010, by which time he had been working for Customs for nearly 10 years, Mr Cranney became the team leader of the Air Border Security team (ABS team) at the airport. The role of the ABS team was to identify and investigate any airport staff suspected of being involved in criminal activity. Staff within the ABS team monitored closed circuit television footage of persons employed at the airport and all passengers arriving at SIA. When required, ABS team members would conduct aircraft and other searches, and staff within the team had access to information regarding ongoing investigations and planned law enforcement activity. The ABS team also assisted with joint operations conducted with other law enforcement agencies.
	
	
	After Mr Cranney became the team leader of the ABS, Valsamakis was also transferred into the ABS team and continued to work in that area until late 2012.
	
	
	In early 2012 , Mr Cranney, Lamella and Valsamakis met several times, both at the airport and elsewhere, to discuss the prospect of facilitating an importation or importations of pseudoephedrine before Mr Cranney left the ABS team in March 2012 and before Valsamakis was transferred out of the ABS team in August 2012. Discussions also canvassed the possibility of Lamella being transferred into the ABS team.
	
	
	These discussions occurred against the background of a failed importation attempt in late 2011 and prior discussions among the three customs officers concerning the prospect of illegal activity.
	
	
	The failed importation, which had involved Lamella, Valsamakis, D Harb, Napoli and others was the subject of the count 1 conspiracy charged against Mr Cranney. Although Mr Cranney was found not guilty of that count, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence adduced at trial that Mr Cranney was aware of the activities of the others in respect of that failed importation and the methodology proposed for effecting the importation and avoiding detection.
	
	
	I am likewise satisfied that he had participated in earlier discussions with both Valsamakis and Lamella concerning the possibility of them all combining to undertake importations of illegal substances. Indeed, on the night of 22 December 2010, Lamella and Mr Cranney met at a hotel room at the Star City Casino. Mr Cranney and Lamella had a conversation then about becoming involved in the importation of illicit substances. Both Lamella and Mr Cranney later informed Valsamakis of what had occurred at the meeting.
	
	
	In the immediate aftermath of the failed importation in December 2011, Lamella, Valsamakis, Mr Cranney, D Harb, Mr Huynh and Napoli entertained plans for future importations of pseudoephedrine through SIA.
	
	
	During December 2011, Lamella was in contact with Napoli and Mr Huynh regarding potential involvement in future importations. Between 27 and 31 December 2011, Lamella and Mr Huynh exchanged a series of text messages in which Mr Huynh asked to meet as he had ""good news"".
	
	
	In early January 2012, Mr Huynh informed Lamella that he had sourced pseudoephedrine in Vietnam and Lamella informed D Harb, Valsamakis and Mr Cranney that ""my mates are ready"".
	
	
	Lamella was the hub around which the entire conspiracy revolved. He coordinated with the SIA personnel (Mr Cranney, Valsamakis and D Harb) and with the external participants, Mr Huynh and Napoli, regarding prospective dates for the importations, the sourcing of the pseudoephedrine, the flights and airlines to be used and the couriers to be used for each importation.
	
	
	The initial step in the methodology employed, which mirrored that which had been unsuccessfully employed in respect of the failed importation in late 2011, involved the exchange of shift rosters to identify dates and times when the Customs officers and D Harb would be on duty. It was decided that the pseudoephedrine would be imported on a Thai airlines flight travelling from Vietnam to Sydney, via Bangkok, arriving in Sydney on 9 March and which would be serviced by D Harb’s employer, Menzies Aviation.
	
	
	During this period there were also discussions among the conspirators regarding the amounts of money to be made. The other SIA personnel all informed Lamella that they each expected to be paid $100,000.00 for participating in any importation. Lamella subsequently informed Mr Cranney, Valsamakis and D Harb that they would each receive $50,000.00 in total for an initial importation proposed for March and they would make up the shortfall (a further $50,000.00) from subsequent importations.
	
	
	Throughout January 2012 Lamella, Napoli and Mr Huynh regularly met, by arrangement primarily through Napoli, to discuss the planned importation. In an intercepted call between Mr Huynh and a Vietnamese male on 19 January 2012, the Vietnamese male referred to Mr Huynh's ability to get things out of aeroplanes. Mr Huynh told the caller that he would buy another SIM card and call him back.
	
	
	On 22 February 2012 Valsamakis and Mr Cranney exchanged a series of coded text messages regarding the organisation of the importation. In the course of these exchanges Mr Cranney informed Valsamakis of the need for them to stay “at arm’s length” from Lamella and the others involved in the importation; that they should let others do the hard work and take the risks; and, that they (Mr Cranney and Valsamakis) would ""reap the benefits"".
	
	
	On 23 February 2012 Mr Huynh and Napoli engaged in a series of intercepted telephone calls in which they discussed ways of raising money.
	
	
	During the planning of the importation, Lamella met with Mr Huynh and Napoli and discussed the organisation of the couriers. During one meeting, Napoli stated that he would organise the couriers. At one of their meetings Lamella, Mr Huynh and Napoli also agreed that each of the two couriers would have about 10 kilograms of “gear” in their bags. During the organisation of the March importation Lamella discussed with Mr Huynh and Napoli the type of people that should be used as couriers and how their tickets should be purchased in order to reduce the risk of detection.
	
	
	On 2 March 2012, the two couriers Samarn Prom (Prom) and Jesse Russell (J Russell)) paid cash for two return business class tickets travelling Thai Airways to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, departing on 3 March 2012 and returning to Sydney, via Bangkok, on 9 March 2012. On 3 March 2012, the couriers departed Australia.
	
	
	At some stage prior to this importation, Napoli provided Lamella with a suitcase identical to the suitcases being used by the couriers and a copy of the bio-data pages from the couriers' passports. Lamella subsequently met with D Harb and showed him the luggage that the couriers would be using and gave him the names of the couriers.
	
	
	On 7 March 2012, Mr Cranney texted Valsamakis to remind him that he was the acting ABS team leader for the shift commencing the following day. Mr Cranney was acting in higher duties at this stage and could decide who would act in his team leader role in the ABS team. On the same date, D Harb called Lamella and they discussed problems with the burn phones, which were subsequently used by them on the morning of the importation to communicate with each other.
	
	
	On 8 March 2012, at 10.10am, Valsamakis and Mr Cranney exchanged SMS text messages arranging to meet at work. At 11.01am, Valsamakis sent Lamella a text message in which he stated ""Talk to the big fella. I gotta go home when I finish, he'll fill me in"". That afternoon Lamella called Mr Cranney in order to discuss the importation and they arranged to catch up and go for a walk.
	
	
	After meeting with Mr Cranney, Lamella met with D Harb to confirm that the importation was proceeding. Lamella then met with Napoli who, in turn, met with Mr Huynh.
	
	
	On 8 March 2012, Prom and Russell boarded a Thai Airways flight in Ho Chi Minh City, and on checking in, each of their bags weighed 28kgs. It is estimated that Prom had 17kg of pseudoephedrine powder in his bag, and Russell had 15kg of pseudoephedrine powder in his bag - in total, 32kg (gross) of pseudoephedrine powder. The value of that pseudoephedrine, based on an estimate of $50,000 per kilogram (with a purity of approximately 70%) was about $1,600,000.00.
	
	
	On 9 March 2012, D Harb, Mr Cranney, Valsamakis and Lamella all commenced the morning shift at SIA. Mr Cranney was an acting ACS Level 3 officer, responsible for the management of a number of teams and Valsamakis was the acting ACS Level 2 officer in the ABS team. Lamella was rostered to work in the Secondary Examinations area in the ""back of hall"".
	
	
	Valsamakis was responsible for ensuring that the cameras in the ABS room were directed away from D Harb. Mr Cranney’s duties enabled him to know whether other areas of the ACBPS (the Control Room and the Business Group) were investigating the couriers and the Thai Airways flight. Lamella was responsible for liaising between the SIA personnel and Napoli.
	
	
	Thai Airways flight TG475 arrived at SIA at about 7.15am. Lamella and D Harb communicated via their burn phones. As planned, D Harb located the couriers' bags, put them inside a baggage can and stored them in an out of the way area.
	
	
	Mr Huynh and Napoli communicated about the collection and delivery of the courier's bags. During these calls, Mr Huynh indicated that he would be communicating with a third person about the collection of the pseudoephedrine.
	
	
	Between 8:21am and 8:28am, Mr Cranney called Lamella and Valsamakis and arranged to meet them for a coffee. When the three met, they discussed various topics relating to the importation, including whether it had gone well and when they would be getting paid. During that morning, both Valsamakis and Mr Cranney, at different times, had provided Lamella with information about an ABS operation on a flight next to the Thai Airlines flight and Lamella passed that information on to D Harb.
	
	
	Lamella and Napoli engaged in a series of coded text messages in which Lamella let Napoli know that D Harb was on his way with the bags of ""gear"" and that everything was progressing well.
	
	
	As planned, D Harb met Napoli in the SIA staff car park, Napoli retrieved the two bags from the Menzies vehicle, put them in the white Toyota Corolla Hatchback he was driving and drove away. Napoli called Mr Huynh, and confirmed that everything was good, and they then arranged to meet at Mr Huynh's residence. Later in the morning of 9 March 2012, Napoli and Lamella exchanged coded text messages confirming that the importation had been successful.
	
	
	Between 16 and 22 March 2012, Valsamakis and Mr Cranney communicated with each other, and with Lamella, in code about their dissatisfaction with the delay in being paid. Lamella in turn communicated with Napoli regarding the progress of the payments and the increasing irritation of the other Customs Officers in not having been being paid.
	
	
	On 23 March 2012 Napoli attended Huynh's residence at Marrickville. Shortly after, Napoli sent Lamella a coded text message in which he indicated that he had the money. The pair then arranged to meet at the Sydney Marriott Hotel where Lamella was staying for the weekend. Napoli gave Lamella a plastic bag with $150,000.00 cash in it and informed Lamella that the money was the first half of the payment.
	
	
	Lamella subsequently divided up the cash so that there was $55,000 each for Mr Cranney and Valsamakis and $20,000 for D Harb. On the evening of 25 March 2012, D Harb collected $20,000.00 from Lamella, being part of his payment for the importation. On the morning of 26 March 2012, Lamella met with Mr Cranney and Valsamakis at work and gave them each a plastic bag containing $55,000.00 in cash. A few days after paying Mr Cranney and Valsamakis, Lamella received an additional $100,000.00 in cash from Napoli which he divided between himself and D Harb.
	
	
	On 30 March 2012, Mr Cranney, Valsamakis and Lamella met at a cafe in Beverly Hills. During this meeting they discussed, in general terms, how well the importation had gone and Mr Cranney and Valsamakis asked Lamella not to forget that they were still owed $50,000.00. They also discussed organising the next importation as soon as possible, which was also a subject of discussion during subsequent meetings at the Terrace Bar at SIA.
	
	
	As both Mr Cranney and Valsamakis were due to be transferred out of the ABS team in the months following the March importation, it was decided that they would try to do another importation as soon as possible. Valsamakis, Lamella and Mr Cranney also discussed having Lamella transferred into the ABS room so that they could maximise their chances of the importations being successful. In the meantime, Lamella continued to meet with D Harb to identify potential dates for future importations based on the various participants’ respective rosters. Lamella passed on the possible dates to Valsamakis, Mr Cranney, Huynh and Napoli and also discussed with D Harb, Valsamakis and Mr Cranney importing 3 bags per day, containing 20 kgs each, so that they could make as much money as possible. It was ultimately agreed that they would import about 120kg of pseudoephedrine split across three Thai Airlines flights arriving on the mornings of 4, 5 and 6 June 2012.
	
	
	During the planning phase for the June importations, Lamella met with Napoli and also separately with Huynh to check on their progress in organising couriers and Huynh's progress in sourcing the pseudoephedrine. During these meetings Lamella provided advice about the methods of concealment, baggage screening processes in Australia and overseas and the courier profiles that were to be used. Lamella also met with Valsamakis and Mr Cranney at various locations (the Terrace Bar at SIA; Flower Power Nursery at Kingsgrove; Tempe Reserve; and Valsamakis' home) to inform them of the progress of the plans.
	
	
	Eventually, Napoli informed Lamella that Mr Huynh had been able to source pseudoephedrine for the importations and the conspirators discussed the amount of money that would be made from the importations. Mr Cranney and Valsamakis informed Lamella that they each wanted to be paid between $350,000.00 - $380,000.00 for the June importations. During their discussions about money, Mr Cranney informed Lamella that he had been talking to people that he knew about the street price of pseudoephedrine and he thought that they were being underpaid.
	
	
	Between 22 April 2012 and 9 May 2012, Mr Huynh travelled to Vietnam for the purpose of sourcing pseudoephedrine for the importations. Whilst he was in Hong Kong on 6 May 2012, Huynh purchased a Blackberry mobile phone. By 9 May 2012, five couriers had been recruited in Queensland for the purpose of travelling to Vietnam and importing the pseudoephedrine. On 21 May 2012, Samarn Prom (Prom) booked 5 business class return tickets for the couriers to travel to Ho Chi Minh City, via Bangkok, with Thai Airways - all departing on 28 May 2012.
	
	
	On 22 May 2012, Valsamakis and Mr Cranney exchanged a series of text messages in which Valsamakis informed Mr Cranney that he had spoken to senior personnel about extending his stay in the ABS team. Around this time Mr Cranney told Valsamakis that he would speak to a senior Customs Officer about getting Lamella transferred into the ABS room to support him during the importations. Mr Cranney subsequently recommended to a supervisor, that Lamella be transferred into the ABS room for a 5 week period, commencing in late May 2012 and finishing just prior to a planned overseas trip from 2 July 2012. Following that recommendation, Lamella was rotated into the ABS team.
	
	
	On about 26 May 2012, whilst working in the ABS room at SIA, Valsamakis became aware that a baggage handler named Chris Weeden, who was often in the company of D Harb, was under investigation. Valsamakis subsequently informed Lamella of the investigation into Weeden, and Lamella informed Mr Cranney. Lamella and Mr Cranney agreed that Weeden could be used as a distraction from their importations and as a diversion in any investigations.
	
	
	On 28 May 2012, Mr Huynh departed Australia for Vietnam. The 5 couriers booked to travel to Vietnam from Sydney on this date did not present for their Thai Airways flight as the psuedoephedrine to be imported between 4 and 6 June 2012 wasn't ready.
	
	
	During late May/early June 2012, Lamella met Napoli on a number of occasions to communicate with Mr Huynh who was in Vietnam, and to coordinate the final details in relation to the planned importations. During these meetings: they discussed how much gear should be in the bags and how they should be packed; they confirmed the number of couriers who were travelling, the dates on which the importations would take place and the flights that would be used; they discussed where Napoli would collect the couriers' bags from D Harb; Napoli provided Lamella with the couriers' names and details; and, Napoli provided Lamella with a description of the suitcases that the couriers' would be using. Lamella subsequently passed this information on to D Harb and Valsamakis.
	
	
	On 1 June 2012, the five couriers each purchased new Thai Airways Business class tickets to Ho Chi Minh City. They were variously booked to return on three separate flights, arriving back in Australia on 4, 5 and 6 June 2012. Prior to departing Australia each of the couriers had been provided with a large silver hard sided suitcase to use for the importation.
	
	
	On the morning of 4 June 2012, Valsamakis and Lamella were working in the ABS team. Mr Cranney, who was the team leader of the floor area of the Arrivals Hall, was responsible for passenger targeting and assessment. D Harb was working as a baggage handler.
	
	
	Valsamakis and Lamella were operating the CCTV cameras in the ABS room from about 6.00am so that they were able to control the images appearing on the CCTV cameras, and (with the exception of some fixed cameras in the basement) keep the ABS cameras away from anything to do with the unloading of the Thai Airways flight.
	
	
	Thai Airways flight (TG475) arrived with the couriers Hikaiti-Paul and Ratahi on board. Both of them had packed their checked in luggage (the silver suitcases) in Ho Chi Minh City with packages containing pseudoephedrine powder designed to look like food. It is estimated that both couriers had about 17kg of pseudoephedrine powder in each of their bags - a total of about 34kg of pseudoephedrine powder. The value of that pseudoephedrine, based on an estimate of $50,000 per kilogram (with a purity of approximately 70%) was about $1,700,000.00.
	
	
	Hikaiti-Paul and Ratahi left SIA without collecting their checked in silver suitcases, which were retrieved from the flight by D Harb and stored in an out of the way area. Later, D Harb collected the couriers' suitcases and, using a work vehicle, drove out of SIA to the pre-arranged meeting point where he delivered the bags to Napoli. During the morning, Lamella and Napoli and Lamella and D Harb, had communicated with each other by phone regarding the delivery of the bags.
	
	
	Whilst the Thai Airways flight was being unloaded, Mr Cranney called Lamella (who remained in the ABS room with Valsamakis) to discuss the fact that the majority of the ABS team had been diverted away from the ABS room to deal with someone having stolen some property from a duty free shop. Later that morning, Mr Cranney, Valsamakis and Lamella met for a coffee and while they were together Lamella informed them that the importation had been successful. That night Lamella and Napoli met to discuss the importation that was to take place the following day.
	
	
	On the morning of 5 June 2012, Valsamakis and Lamella were again working in the ABS team, Mr Cranney, was again working as a supervisor in the Customs Arrivals Hall, and D Harb was working as a baggage handler.
	
	
	Lamella and Valsamakis were again both involved in monitoring the CCTV cameras in the ABS room between 6.00am - 8.00am. During this time they kept the cameras directed away from the unloading of Thai Airways flight and focused on an unrelated investigation occurring simultaneously.
	
	
	Thai Airways flight TG475 arrived at SIA with the courier Erlambang on board. Erlambang's silver suitcase contained a large number of packages of pseudoephedrine powder designed to look like food. It is estimated that Erlambang had 18kg of pseudophedrine powder in his bag. The value of that pseudoephedrine, based on an estimate of $50,000 per kilogram (with a purity of approximately 70%) was about $900,000.00.
	
	
	Erlambang left SIA without collecting his checked luggage, which was retrieved from the flight by D Harb and stored in a baggage can. Later D Harb delivered Erlambang's suitcase to Napoli at Tempe. During the morning Lamella, Napoli and D Harb communicated with each other by phone regarding the delivery of the bags. At about 11:10am, Mr Cranney, Lamella and Valsamakis had a coffee together, and when they met, Lamella informed them that the importation had been a success.
	
	
	On the morning of 6 June 2012 Valsamakis and Lamella each again commenced work in the ABS team. Mr Cranney was again working as a supervisor in the Customs Arrivals Hall. D Harb was working as a baggage handler.
	
	
	At 5.05am, Mr Cranney sent both Valsamakis and Lamella a text message asking them to meet for a coffee. When Lamella and Valsamakis met Mr Cranney, there was another Customs officer present who informed them about a Customs investigation that was underway in relation to two passengers who had not collected their luggage from a flight on 4 June, and a baggage handler who had been removing luggage from flights.
	
	
	On returning to the ABS room, Lamella and Valsmakis were informed by their supervisor that the ABS team would be conducting a containment exercise in relation to the Thai Airways flight which was arriving that morning. This involved retrieving any luggage that matched the appearance of the luggage that had not been collected by the first two couriers on 4 June 2012. Valsamakis and Lamella volunteered to find the luggage.
	
	
	Between 5:56am and 5:59am Mr Cranney and Lamella exchanged a number of SMS messages about meeting up. Lamella does not recall meeting Mr Cranney at this time. However, Valsamakis recalls that at about this time, he and Mr Cranney met either outside the Customs Secure Work Area or in one of the corridors at SIA, and Mr Cranney told him that he and Lamella needed to take care of the situation in ""any shape or way possible"".
	
	
	The Thai Airways flight from Ho Chi Minh City (TG475) arrived at SIA at about 7.15am. Lamella and Valsamakis attended the baggage area, located the courier's two silver suitcases and Valsamakis removed the airline bag tags from each of the bags in an unsuccessful attempt to remove identifying material from the bags. Lamella and Valsamakis then placed the suitcases on the conveyer belt to be sent to the baggage hall where the couriers had been detained.
	
	
	The two couriers, Garcia and Musa, disembarked from the flight and were subsequently detained and arrested. Forensic examination of their suitcases revealed that they contained a total of 28.29 kilograms of pure pseudoephedrine (40.7kg gross) concealed within a total of 24 packages designed to look like food. The value of that pseudoephedrine, based on an estimate of $50,000 per kilogram (with a purity of approximately 70%) was about $2,000,000.00.
	
	
	It is estimated that 28.29 kilograms of pure pseudoephedrine is capable of producing at least 19 kilograms of high grade methylamphetamine hydrochloride. It is further estimated that the wholesale value of that amount of methylamphetamine would be about $4,750,000.00 (based on $250,000.00 per kg) and the street value would be about $15,200,000.00 (based on $800.00 per gram).
	
	
	That afternoon Valsamakis, Mr Cranney and Lamella met at the Flower Power Nursery, Kingsgrove. At this meeting they discussed the fallout from the detection of the importation. Lamella indicated to Valsamakis and Mr Cranney that they may have to ""take a bit of a hit” on the amounts they would be paid as about 40kg of ""gear"" had been seized, but both Valsamakis and Mr Cranney indicated that they still expected to be paid the agreed amount.
	
	
	Through cross-examination of Lamella and Valsamakis by his counsel, Mr Cranney attempted to advance a thoroughly incredible version of what occurred at that meeting designed to suggest that Mr Cranney had no prior knowledge or involvement in the activities of the combination.
	
	
	Between about 7 June 2012 and 28 June 2012 , Valsamakis and Mr Cranney communicated with each other, and Lamella, again in code about being paid. Lamella in turn communicated with Napoli regarding payment. During this time the Customs Officers met and communicated about when and how much they would be paid, and Valsamakis and Mr Cranney pressured Lamella for payment.
	
	
	Eventually on the evening of 28 June 2012, Napoli transferred a plastic bag containing a large amount of cash into Lamella's vehicle in Lamella's street. Lamella and Valsamakis sat in Lamella's car and divided up the cash. They had agreed to short change Mr Cranney by taking an extra $5,000 each, which would result in Lamella and Valsamakis each receiving $100,000.00 and Mr Cranney only $85,000.00. After splitting the money, Valsamakis left with his $100,000.00. D Harb then collected his payment of about $70,000.00 from Lamella.
	
	
	After communicating via mobile phone, Mr Cranney drove to Lamella's home, met with Lamella outside in the street and received a plastic bag containing $85,000.00 in cash. Mr Cranney subsequently delivered the bag of cash to his brother at a pre-arranged location in western Sydney.
	
	
	On 30 June 2012, at 10:39am, Mr Cranney called the NIB and paid his health insurance 12 months in advance at a cost of $1,169.04. At 3.15pm, Mr Cranney paid $3,000.00 ($2,600.00 being paid in cash) for a new TV, dishwasher and refrigerator at a retailer in Castle Hill. Analysis of Mr Cranney's financial records reveals that he had access to cash amounts from unknown sources between 1 January 2012 and 30 March 2012, and from 1 June 2012 to 30 December 2012. Most notably, for the month of June 2012 he had access to unknown source funds of $8,820.50, for July 2012 $6,300.00 and for August 2012 $2,882.25.
	
	
	After arriving back in Australia on 8 June 2012, two days after the failed importation, Mr Huynh departed Australia again on 2 July 2012 and did not return until 28 August 2012. During this period, large amounts of cash were deposited into his bank accounts.
	
	
	Between early July 2012 and Lamella's arrest on 17 December 2012, Mr Cranney, Valsamakis and Lamella communicated and met to discuss the ongoing police investigation that was being undertaken in relation to their importations; the arrest of Paul Katralis and Joseph Harb in relation to another importation conducted on 18 August 2012; and, the outstanding money for the June importations. During the course of these discussions, Mr Cranney indicated to Valsamakis that he was unhappy about being underpaid and that he expected it to be rectified; Mr Cranney warned Lamella that a colleague was going to speak to him about the relationship between Joseph Harb and David Harb; and, Mr Cranney raised with Valsamakis the prospect of doing another importation when Valsamakis returned from leave.
	
	
	On 17 December 2012, Lamella was arrested and charged in relation to his involvement in importations conducted with J Harb in 2009 and 2010. On 7 February 2013, Lamella provided an induced statement to the police that detailed his involvement variously with Valsamakis, Mr Cranney, D Harb, Mr Huynh and Napoli in the importations of pseudoephedrine into Australia conducted between December 2011 and 6 June 2012. Lamella subsequently surrendered a total of $39,244.00 in cash seized by the AFP during searches of his residence and the residence of his cousin.
	
	
	On 12 February 2013, Valsamakis was arrested by the AFP. He voluntarily participated in a recorded interview in which he made substantial admissions regarding his involvement, and the involvement of Mr Cranney, Lamella and D Harb in the importation of commercial quantities of pseudoephedrine into Australia between December 2011 and June 2012. On 14 and 21 February 2013, Valsamakis voluntarily surrendered a total of $110,400.00 in cash to the AFP. On 7 May 2013, Valsamakis provided a sworn statement to the police that detailed his involvement with Lamella and Mr Cranney in the importations of pseudoephedrine into Australia conducted between December 2011 and 6 June 2012.
	
	
	On 12 February 2013, Mr Cranney, D Harb and Napoli were also arrested by the AFP. Mr Cranney declined to be interviewed and at no stage has he provided any assistance to the authorities in the investigation of this or any other matter. No cash has been surrendered by or seized from Mr Cranney.
	
	
	On 14 October 2013 Mr Huynh was arrested by the AFP. He declined to be interviewed and at no stage has he provided any assistance to the authorities. No cash has been surrendered by or seized from Mr Huynh.
	
	
	The offence of conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of a border controlled precursor is a very serious offence as indicated by the maximum penalty which Parliament has prescribed. The substance involved here, pseudoephedrine is a precursor to the production of the drug methylamphetamine, more commonly known as “ice”. This was well known to both offenders and I have no doubt that they both believed that the substance was being imported for the purpose of others manufacturing that drug for eventual sale in the community. A substantial percentage of the substance imported was not intercepted and there is no reason to expect other than that it was eventually used as intended and has ultimately made its way into the community.
	
	
	Any involvement in a conspiracy to import controlled precursors into Australia is by its nature serious. When the amounts involved are as large as they are in the present case, and where the offenders were generally aware of the quantities involved, as they were here, the conduct amounts to extremely serious criminality. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that both offenders knew that the quantities being imported were substantial and in the order of many tens of kilograms. Their expectations concerning payment is indicative of this knowledge.
	
	
	The present conspiracy involved a substantial degree of planning and coordination of a number of individuals. It was far from unsophisticated in its conception and execution.
	
	
	Both offenders are to be sentenced for the conspiracy offence. With their co-conspirators, they each performed vital roles in seeking to achieve the criminal objects of the combination and each is to some degree responsible for the other’s actions in pursuing that object. There appears to have been no strict hierarchy among the primary conspirators (by that description I exclude the couriers). They appeared to have conducted themselves on the basis of a degree of equality, despite their different roles. This is reflected not only in the ways they conducted themselves but to some extent also in the reasonable correspondence in the amounts the conspirators were paid, were that can be ascertained.
	
	
	Lamella was obviously central to the conception and execution of the conspiracy, in that he was the person with contacts within and outside the airport. His role was critical to the success of the operation.
	
	
	Mr Huynh too, as the person responsible for sourcing the product, played a role critical to the successful execution of the agreement.
	
	
	It seems to me that the roles of Valsamakis and Mr Cranney were substantially indistinguishable and, save for one not insignificant distinction, their objective criminality was very similar in my view. The distinction lies in their respective positions within the hierarchy of the Customs service.
	
	
	In the course of sentencing Valsamakis, Judge Hanley SC noted that the fact the offending occurred whilst employed as an ACBPS officer in dereliction of the public duties he was entrusted to discharge and in circumstances where he used knowledge and information that he had gained from his position as an ACBPS officer were serious aggravating factors and that his conduct involved a gross breach of trust. Those remarks apply with even greater force in the case of Mr Cranney on account of his more senior rank within that service.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Mr Cranney was deliberately and enthusiastically involved in all four of the importations carried out in pursuit of the conspiracy. He acted together with his two colleagues to circumvent the screening and investigative systems in place at SIA to ensure, so far as possible, that the couriers were able to pass through the airport without being detected. In doing so, he participated in the active subversion of the screening and detection systems designed to prevent such importations.
	
	
	It was the Crown submission at trial that if the jury were satisfied as to the count 1 conspiracy, they could move with a degree of expediency to conviction in respect of count 2. I do not accept the submission put on behalf of Mr Cranney on sentence that because the jury returned a verdict of not guilty to count 1 (and, correspondingly, count 3) the facts which can be found to the requisite standard in respect of count 2 are uncertain. There were perfectly well explicable reasons for the verdict on count 1 that neither undermine the reliability of the verdict on count 2 nor give rise to any particular consequent uncertainty concerning his involvement in all four importations the subject of that count. The case for conviction on count 2 was compelling in my view. Contrary to the submissions put on behalf of Mr Cranney on sentence, I do not consider that there exists any difficulty in identifying the circumstances that led to Mr Cranney becoming involved in the count 2 conspiracy. The genesis of his involvement resides in the earlier conversations he had with both Lamella and Valsamakis in respect of the prospect of them all combining to participate in the future in criminal conduct. One of the earliest of those conversations appears to have been the casino conversation in late 2010 to which I have already made reference. The finding of not guilty in respect of count 1 does not have the inevitable consequence that one must disregard the evidence of prior conversations among the three customs officers, including the casino conversation in 2010. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that conversations to that effect occurred and that they represent the context against which Mr Cranney’s involvement in the 2012 conspiracy is sensibly explained.
	
	
	Between about January 2012 and June 2012 (that is, over a period of about 6 months) Mr Cranney engaged in the following conduct.
	
	
	He assisted in planning each of the importations with Valsamakis and Lamella, including co-ordinating rosters and discussing the methodology to be employed for each importation to minimise the risk of the couriers and consignments of pseudoephedrine being intercepted.
	
	
	He engaged in discussions with Valsamakis and Lamella regarding the status of the planned importations; Lamella's progress in liaising with the co-conspirators who were sourcing the pseudoephedrine and organising the couriers; the amounts of money that they expected to be paid for participating in each of the importations, and when they expected to be paid; and, after each importation, discussed with Valsamakis and Lamella whether the importations had succeeded.
	
	
	In respect of the March and June importations, he used or stood ready to use his more senior position to try and facilitate the most effective deployment of resources, including the roles of Lamella and Valsamakis within the ABS team, to minimise the risk of the couriers being intercepted.
	
	
	He conveyed information to Lamella regarding the status of another unrelated customs investigation so that the information could be passed on to D Harb who may otherwise have been concerned that he was the subject of the investigation, which might have resulted in some compromise of the 9 March importation.
	
	
	He monitored the Control Room, the Business Group area and the ABS room to ensure that the CCTV cameras in each of these areas were not monitoring the relevant flight on 9 March.
	
	
	Following the March importation, he received a large quantity of cash as payment for his participation in the planning and conduct of the importation. In the period between the importation and receipt of payment, he pressured Lamella to obtain payment.
	
	
	During the conduct of the June importations, he communicated with Lamella regarding the diversion of customs resources away from the ABS team onto other unrelated investigations.
	
	
	When the couriers were detected on 6 June 2012, he instructed Valsamakis, relevantly a subordinate within the customs service, to disrupt and divert the investigation to avoid the participants in the importation (including himself) being discovered.
	
	
	On 28 June 2012, he attended Lamella's residence to receive a large quantity of cash as payment for his participation in the planning and conduct of the June importations. In the period between those importations and receipt of payment, he was again instrumental in putting pressure on Lamella to obtain payment.
	
	
	Throughout the period of the conspiracy Mr Cranney occupied relatively senior, supervisory roles within the customs service that encompassed the supervision at different times of different areas of the airport including the ABS room, the control room and client services. His position gave him the capacity to monitor what was occurring in other areas of the airport and to allocate staff, in particular, on some of the days of the four importations. The fact that he might be described as being less 'hands on' than either Lamella or Valsamakis on the days of the importations does not reduce his criminal culpability. He had expressed a calculated intention to remain ""at arms length"". Rather, the senior positions that he occupied permitted him to misuse his authority to facilitate the objects of the conspiracy. I am satisfied that he was standing by, ready to do anything within the scope of the capacity afforded him by his seniority to assist the successful execution of the importations. This misuse of his position, and his seniority, increases his criminal culpability in my assessment.
	
	
	The evidence establishes that over an extended period Mr Cranney, motivated solely by personal gain, used his position as a senior Customs officer of 11 or more years standing to actively corrupt a central and frontline investigative unit at SIA. He did so in order to minimise the risk of the couriers, and by extension himself and the other conspirators, being detected and apprehended, and to ensure, insofar as he was able to, the successful importation of substantial quantities of pseudoephedrine into Australia. Given that his official duties were primarily concerned with the prevention of such importations, his conduct involved a gross breach of trust.
	
	
	Ultimately, Mr Cranney received about $55,000.00 for the 9 March 2012 importation and $85,000.00 for the June 2012 importations - a total of $140,000.00.
	
	
	Throughout the period of the conspiracy, he blatantly abused his privileged position and access to sensitive information and he ignored his specific responsibilities, which included counteracting ""threats to the border posed by illegal activity involving persons travelling through or employed in the environs of the airport"". This conduct was considered and pre-meditated, and was not committed in a sudden lapse of judgment.
	
	
	The evidence compels the conclusion that Mr Huynh played a significant role in the execution of the conspiracy. Like Mr Cranney, he was a deliberate and active participant in the conspiracy over an extended period. I reject the submission put on Mr Huynh’s behalf on sentence that the Court should conclude that he was involved only in the March importation. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was involved in all four importations undertaken in pursuit of the conspiracy. He was certainly motivated by, and appears also to have achieved, personal financial benefit. Whilst bearing in mind that like Mr Cranney, Mr Huynh is to be sentenced for a conspiracy offence, and not simply for committing the identifiable physical acts that were committed by him in furthering that conspiracy, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his active participation in the realization of the conspiracy involved at least the following matters.
	
	
	In or about late December 2011 or early January 2012 he identified a source of pseudoephedrine in Vietnam.
	
	
	In late December 2011 and January 2012 he engaged in coded communications with Lamella, whom he knew was working as a Customs officer at SIA regarding a potential importation.
	
	
	Throughout January to June 2012 met regularly with Napoli and Lamella (together and separately) regarding the sourcing of pseudoephedrine in Vietnam; the dates for the importations; the organisation of the couriers for the March and June 2012 importations; the bags and methodology to be employed for the March and June 2012 importations, including the amounts of pre-cursor to be packed in the couriers bags and the amounts of money to be paid to the Customs officers and D Harb.
	
	
	Throughout January to June 2012 he used numerous mobile phones in false names to communicate with, at first Lamella and Napoli, and later only Napoli in order to avoid detection by law enforcement authorities.
	
	
	On 19 January 2012, in a telephone conversation with an overseas Vietnamese contact, discussed his ability to engage in clandestine importations involving aircraft.
	
	
	Took steps to raise about $10,000.00 in funds in February 2012 to be used to cover costs associated with the importation.
	
	
	For the purpose of the 9 March 2012 importation he hired a car to be used for the collection of the courier's bags by Napoli from the airport.
	
	
	On 9 March 2012 communicated with Napoli, passing on instructions regarding where to put the bags and coordinating the delivery of the bags by Napoli to another person that Mr Huynh was in contact with.
	
	
	Met regularly with Napoli between 10 March and 23 March 2012, at a time when payment for the March importation was being discussed between Napoli and Lamella.
	
	
	Between 22 April and 9 May 2012 travelled to Vietnam, via Hong Kong and Singapore, for the purpose of sourcing pseudoephedrine and organising the June importations.
	
	
	On 28 May 2012 returned to Vietnam to continue organising the June importations and to resolve issues that had apparently arisen with sourcing the pseudoephedrine. He did not return to Australia until 8 June 2012, after the arrest of Garcia and Musa. Whilst in Vietnam, he communicated with Napoli and Lamella via a Blackberry phone to co-ordinate and confirm the plans for the importations, including the number of couriers to be used and the amount of pseudoephedrine to be placed in their bags.
	
	
	I agree with the Crown’s submission that Mr Huynh's role was more critical than that of Napoli's to the overall criminal enterprise. I reject the submission, made upon the basis of Mr Huynh’s evidence at trial, which I do not accept, that he only became involved in order to assist Napoli in the repayment of a debt owed to J Harb and Lamella.
	
	
	Mr Huynh performed a critical role sourcing the large amounts of pseudoephedrine powder of a relatively high purity in Vietnam and travelled to Vietnam twice within five weeks in April and May 2012 for this purpose.
	
	
	Given his role in sourcing the pseudoephedrine, I infer that he was well aware of the quantities of pseudoephedrine being imported on each of the four occasions.
	
	
	On the day of the 9 March 2012 importation, Mr Huynh gave instructions to Napoli via phone regarding, in particular, what was to be done with the courier's bags. Unlike Napoli, Mr Huynh distanced himself from the collection of the courier's bags containing the pseudoephedrine for the March importation. For the June importations Mr Huynh remained in Vietnam.
	
	
	Evidence at trial showed significant cash deposits into accounts held by Mr Huynh in the periods following the March and June 2012 importations. It is impossible to discern precisely how much Mr Huynh received for participating in each of the importations, however I am satisfied beyond doubt that his participation was financially motivated and that his reward was far from insubstantial.
	
	
	Mr Cranney is 41 years of age and has no relevant criminal antecedents. In fact, as the Crown’s submissions record, Mr Cranney's prior good character was a necessary pre-requisite to his employment as a Customs Officer.
	
	
	He enjoyed an apparently happy, supportive and relevantly unremarkable upbringing. He finished his education to Year 12, but reports being more sporty in his interests than academic. He is assessed as having an intellect within the average range.
	
	
	At school Mr Cranney played representative basketball and rugby league. He went on to play senior rugby league for the Parramatta club, including some NRL games, and he played for a time in the reserves for St George. His football career was cut short on account of injury, which has resulted in some ongoing issues with arthritis, which is treated with analgesics for pain and may ultimately require knee replacements.
	
	
	Mr Cranney has a daughter now aged 23 from a relationship he had when he was very young. That daughter is now studying at University interstate and he has a good relationship with her. In 1995 Mr Cranney met his future wife and they married in 2001. By then Mr Cranney was employed at Customs, which meant being away from home for long hours. This may have been a contributing factor in the eventual demise of the marriage, along with some very significant health and family issues his wife had to deal with and which had significant implications across the extended family. Before they divorced in 2008 the couple had two children, a boy now aged thirteen and a girl aged ten. Mr Cranney enjoys the continuing strong support of his family, including his parents, his children and his brother. His parents visit him regularly in custody and take their grandchildren with them as well.
	
	
	A psychological assessment done for the purposes of sentencing revealed no marked elevations indicating clinical psychopathology. There was no evidence of unusual thoughts, anti-social behavior, undue paranoia or hostility, extreme moodiness or impulsivity. Whilst he is evidencing some signs of depression and anxiety, these were considered to be commensurate with his circumstances pre-sentence and not clinical in their manifestation. The psychologist considered that Mr Cranney had a tendency to portray himself in a positive manner and may have a slight difficulty acknowledging negative aspects of his personality. He was assessed as being generally positive in his self-concept with a clear sense of purpose and clear beliefs. He has positive interests in fishing, reading and sports in general. He exhibits a strong need for affiliation with, and positive regard from, others. In this respect, family is very important to him. He reported that perceived stressors are buffered by people to whom he can turn for support when necessary. The psychologist’s view was that this is a favourable prognostic sign for future adjustment.
	
	
	Mr Cranney is assessed by the psychologist as having good prospects for rehabilitation and as being at a low risk of re-offending in a like manner.
	
	
	Two matters potentially undermine that assessment. The first is that Mr Cranney apparently continues to dispute aspects of his involvement in the offending. It appears that he maintains the version that was reflected in his counsel’s cross-examination of Valsamakis and Lamella, which, as I recorded earlier, is frankly incredible. Secondly, whilst he has expressed remorse in the sense of regret for the consequences on his family of his present situation, he has expressed no remorse for or insight into the broader consequences of his conduct or the failings which it represented by his abuse of the trust and authority which was reposed in him as a customs officer responsible also for the conduct of more junior officers.
	
	
	Apart from those matters, I do think there are a number of positive matters which point favourably to the prospect of Mr Cranney in the future making a law abiding contribution to the life of his family and his community. Primary among those matters is the strong family support he enjoys. He also has a strong reciprocal concern for family and his future goals are focused on looking after and being a good parent to his children. He is also reasonably intelligent and this likely has substantial positive consequences for his prospects of re-engagement with meaningful employment. He already has an Advanced Diploma in Accounting and a Certificate in injection moulding. He appears well equipped to engage in whatever educational and vocational programs that may be available to him in custody and in the psychologist’s opinion he would benefit from such involvement to keep his mind active and as a means of stress management. In addition to the foregoing matters, Mr Cranney does not have any substance abuse problems of the kind that so frequently undermine prospects of successful rehabilitation. He has also been assessed as demonstrating no diagnosable psychopathology or criminogenic traits, matters which also frequently operate to undermine rehabilitative prospects. Finally, Mr Cranney has no prior convictions which would point against the prospect of his rehabilitation. Aside from the impact of that factor on an assessment of his prospects for rehabilitation, it is something on account of which I will accord him some leniency in this exercise.
	
	
	Naturally it is ultimately in the best interests of the community if Mr Cranney’s rehabilitation can be achieved, and given what I believe are his good prospects in that regard weight must be given to that object in the present exercise. Tending in different directions, however, are other objects which must also be accorded significance in sentencing for the present offending.
	
	
	Australia’s borders are far more than a mere notional delimitation of its sovereignty. There is a significant practical dimension to the recognition of national borders and maintenance of their security. Some items and substances are considered by Parliament to be sufficiently detrimental to the safety and well-being of the community as to warrant prohibition or restriction on their importation. The interception and seizure of such contraband is an important executive function. That function depends for its efficacy upon the diligent and honest commitment to their duty of the officers charged with responsibility for maintaining the integrity of our borders. A customs officer is in a position of authority and trust. As the Court of Criminal Appeal observed in connection with Lamella [R v Lamella [2014] NSWCCA 123, Price J stated (Garling J and Bellew J agreeing), at [57]];
	


“The abuse by a Customs officer of the trust reposed in him by misusing his knowledge to facilitate the importation into Australia of border-controlled precursors and prohibited drugs is a very serious crime, as is the bribery of a Customs officer. These offences undermine the very core of our Nation's border protection and other Customs officers must be deterred from engaging in similar conduct.""


	
	The evidence in the present case pointed to the existence of a disturbing culture within parts at least of the Customs Service. That evidence suggested that illegal activity among people charged with the responsibility of protecting the integrity of our borders has been far more extensive than merely the matters the subject of the present offending. It is encouraging that there are apparently systems in place which enabled detection of this and some of that other offending. Nonetheless, it is important that the Courts make clear to others tempted to engage in similar criminal conduct that this type of offending will attract penalties appropriately reflecting the community’s abhorrence of such a breach of trust. Mr Cranney’s offending involved a significant and cynical compromise of the authority and trust which was reposed in him, in an expectation of substantial financial reward.
	
	
	The community is entitled to expect that any sentence will carry an element of denunciation and punishment so as to reflect appropriate proportionality between the circumstances of the crime committed and the sentence imposed, taking account, of course, of the subjective circumstances so as to properly reflect the fundamental notion of individualized justice that underpins the exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	Mr Huynh is 38 years of age and has an extensive criminal history involving drug related offences. The conduct the subject of the present offence, against the backdrop of his prior criminal record, demonstrates a continuing disregard for the law, particularly in relation to dealing in prohibited illicit drugs. Mr Huynh has served a number of terms of imprisonment for drug related offences, the most recent being from 28 November 2006 to 27 May 2009 relating to the supply of a prohibited drug. Accordingly, the object of specific deterrence assumes some significance in the present synthesis.
	
	
	There is evidence which suggests that Mr Huynh was raised in a dysfunctional and emotionally and physically abusive environment. At the age of 14 and a half, he ran away from home and lived on the streets for 6 to 9 months, during which time a now long history of abusing alcohol and illicit drugs began and escalated over time. At that time he supported himself and his escalating substance use by resort to criminal activity including, but not confined to, car theft.
	
	
	Mr Huynh claims to have begun to cut back his drug use in 2012 in response to auditory hallucinations and paranoia. He claims that by the time of his arrest he was only using cocaine and MDMA now and again and was drinking alcohol only socially.
	
	
	Mr Huynh has never been married and has no children. He has no vocational qualifications and claims to have supported himself primarily on income derived from gambling. There is some indication that he has from time to time had unskilled work of different kinds.
	
	
	The psychologist who assessed Mr Huynh for the purposes of sentencing diagnosed Alcohol misuse disorder in partial remission since 2011, poly substance use disorders of varying severity, all reportedly in remission in controlled environments, and a personality disorder with noteworthy features of antisocial personality, secondary to his life circumstances.
	
	
	The psychologist concluded that Mr Huynh is an emotionally damaged individual in need of long term psychological treatment and a high level of rehabilitation focused support in the community. It is feared that without treatment of that kind, he will be incapable of controlling his level of substance and alcohol abuse. Without that treatment he is assessed as a high probability of resuming heavy drug and alcohol use with the inevitable consequences for his physical and psychological health. It was suggested by the psychologist that Mr Huynh would benefit from extended supervision upon his eventual release, with a condition of a highly structured substance abuse rehabilitation program of no less than 6 to 12 months, possibly residential. Without intervention of that kind, it appears that Mr Huynh’s prospects are slim of him ever abandoning the criminal lifestyle he has apparently maintained for the past 25 or so years.
	
	
	In that context, I consider that in fixing a sentence in the case of Mr Huynh it is appropriate to take account of the social, educational, psychological and other disadvantages that his history reflects and which doubtless endure to a significant extent. That history, and the need to try and avoid institutionalization, both justify the conclusion that he will need substantial assistance reintegrating into the community when he is eventually released. That assistance, and attendant supervision, will be an important component in attempting to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to address his rehabilitation and thus ensure, to the fullest extent possible, that the community is protected from future offending by this offender. There has been no particular indication on the part of Mr Huynh of a willingness to engage with treatment of the kind indicated. That and the absence of any expression of remorse leave little scope for any optimism about his prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	It seems to me that, in the case of both offenders, there is no appropriate alternative to a sentence of full-time imprisonment. I didn’t understand there to be any issue about that on behalf of either offender. I will take into account in the case of both offenders, the time already spent in custody on remand. I will also take into account, in their favour, that whilst on bail both men were subject to quite stringent conditions inhibiting their liberty for a reasonably lengthy period of time. Also in their favour, I have taken account of the preparedness of both of them to facilitate the course of justice. In both cases the defence manifested a preparedness to make concessions, and adopt positions in respect of particular matters and issues, that almost certainly shortened the proceedings.
	
	
	The Commonwealth Director provided a table of what were described as co-offender and comparative cases. Whilst useful from the point of view of parity, a genuine regard for consistency in Commonwealth sentencing, as distinct from promoting the most punitive response, might have resulted in provision of a broader comparative range. The only case referred to in the table which did not involve co-offenders or their associates was the notorious case of a former Assistant Director of the New South Wales Crime Commission, Standen. The table made no reference, for example, to a recent decision of another judge of this Court, sitting as an Acting Supreme Court judge, in the matter of Spadina. I was referred to that case by counsel for Mr Huynh, not so much in respect of penalty, but on another point. As Blackmore AJ noted in that case, the sentence imposed in Standen rather stands as an outlier, having regard to the position held by that offender at the time of the offending and the consequent extremity of his breach of trust and authority. Standen’s position within the relevant organisation was substantially more senior than was Mr Cranney’s within the Customs service. Together with all the other matters I have outlined, I have taken into account the various cases I have been referred to, including the starting points before discounts of comparable co-offenders and the points of distinction in the various objective and subjective cases of each, in determining what I consider to be the appropriate sentences in respect of these offenders.
	
	
	In the case of Mr Cranney, I will, as the Crown submitted I might, impose sentences in respect of the bribery offences which are wholly concurrent with the sentence for the conspiracy offence. This is done to reflect the fact that the bribery offences are for all intents and purposes coincident with the conspiracy offence and, also, because the abuse of a position of trust is treated as an aggravating feature of the conspiracy offence.
	


Orders


	
	Mr Cranney:
	


For the offence of conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of a border controlled precursor the offender is convicted.

I impose a term of imprisonment of 14 years commencing 12 May 2014.

For the first offence of receiving a bribe the offender is convicted.

For the first offence of receiving a bribe I impose a term of imprisonment of 4 years and six months commencing 12 May 2014.

For the second offence of receiving a bribe the offender is convicted.

For the second offence of receiving a bribe I impose a term of imprisonment of 5 years commencing 12 May 2014.

I fix a non-parole period of 8 years and nine months commencing 12 May 2014 and expiring 11 February 2023. I recommend release to parole on that day. There will be a period of 5 years and 3 months on parole. The sentence will be completed on 11 May 2028. On parole the offender is to accept such supervision as Community Corrections NSW determine for so long as that service considers necessary.

For clarity, I repeat that the total term is 14 years dating from 12 May 2014, which takes into account all the time spent in custody prior to today. The non-parole period is 8 years and 9 months.

2768244,Aravena v R [2015] NSWCCA 288,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The appellant, Alexander Aravena, was charged with the offence of recklessly inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse, pursuant to s 61K(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Two further counts, of indecent assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, were charged in the alternative. At trial, the Crown adduced tendency evidence pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) of a 2006 incident in respect of which the appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of indecent assault.

On 26 March 2014, a jury returned a verdict of guilty to the s 61K(a) offence. A sentence of 5 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months, was imposed upon the appellant.

The appellant sought leave to appeal against his conviction pursuant to s 5(1)(a) and s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The appellant advanced two grounds of appeal:

That the trial judge, his Honour Hanley SC, erred in admitting the tendency evidence against the appellant; and

That his Honour failed to put the defence case to the jury and thereby occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

Held per the Court, refusing leave to appeal as to ground (2) and dismissing ground (1) of the appeal:

It is not necessary, for evidence to be admissible as tendency evidence, that the conduct occur on a number of occasions so as to evince a particular pattern of behaviour or a modus operandi. Although a single incident some years before may provide a weaker foundation than might have been the case for a tendency sought to be proved by evidence of multiple incidents of relevant conduct, such considerations did not deprive the evidence in this case of significance in the sense contemplated by s 97. [85]-[88]

R v Ford (2009) 201 A Crim R 451; FB v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 217; Saoud v The Queen [2014] NSWCCA 136; 87 NSWLR 481; R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457; R v Lock (1997) 91 A Crim R 356.

There was no error in the decision of the trial judge to admit the evidence under s 101 of the Evidence Act. As the critical issues for the determination of the jury were the nature of the assault upon the complainant by the appellant, and the question of his intention at the time, the probative value of the tendency evidence was very high. [96]

The obligation on a trial judge is to act fairly and accurately to put the respective cases for the Crown and the accused to the jury. Whether that obligation has been met falls to be assessed in light of the nature of the trial, its length and complexity and by way of reference to the way in which the parties have conducted their respective cases. [106]-[107]

The fact that no objection was taken to matters put or omitted in summing up is cogent evidence in most cases that counsel saw no injustice or error in what was done. [120], [122]

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: This is an appeal brought by Alexander Aravena (the appellant) against his conviction for an offence of recklessly inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse, an offence contrary to s 61K(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	The appellant was arraigned before his Honour Judge Hanley SC and a jury panel on 18 March 2014 upon an indictment charging him with that offence, together with two further charges, of indecent assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, each brought in the alternative to the s 61K(a) offence. The appellant entered a plea of not guilty to the principal charge and to the alternative count of indecent assault, but pleaded guilty to the physical assault contrary to s 59 of the Crimes Act. His trial commenced. On 26 March 2014 the jury returned a verdict of guilty to the s 61K(a) offence; it thus being unnecessary to return verdicts against the alternative counts.
	
	
	A sentence of 5 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months, was later imposed upon the applicant. There is no appeal against that sentence.
	
	
	The appeal is brought pursuant to ss 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). There is an issue as to whether leave is required to argue some or all grounds raised. That issue will be dealt with below.
	


The Crown Case at Trial


	
	The complainant was aged 21 years at the time of this incident. She gave evidence that, on the night of 8 February 2013 she went to the Regent Hotel in Kingsford with friends. Whilst at the hotel, she drank eight or nine schooners of full-strength beer. She remained there with friends until closing time, which was around dawn.
	
	
	On leaving the hotel, the complainant accompanied two young men to a nearby park, for the purpose of obtaining cannabis, although this quest was unsuccessful. The complainant thereafter walked to a bus stop on Bunnerong Road, intending to make her way home.
	
	
	She waited at the bus stop for about 10 minutes but, when no bus arrived, she began to walk. By that stage, the complainant was feeling slightly “tipsy”. She had walked only a very short distance when a white van drove towards her from the direction of Eastgardens. The van turned into a driveway in front of her. The appellant, who was driving the van, opened the front passenger door, and the complainant climbed inside the vehicle, assuming that she had been offered a lift.
	
	
	The complainant told the appellant where to drop her, and he began driving in the direction she had indicated to him. She spoke to him about having been in the park earlier with the two men. The appellant said very little in response.
	
	
	When the van reached Grace Campbell Crescent, the complainant told the appellant, “This is my street”. Instead of stopping, the appellant responded with something like, “Cops are there” and continued driving. The complainant could not see any police. She directed the appellant to an alternative entrance to her street but he again made some comment about “the cops being there” and continued on. The complainant began to feel nervous.
	
	
	The appellant drove some distance in the general direction of the airport, before reaching Botany Road and Foreshore Road, well away from the complainant’s home, and in an area with little or no housing. The complainant asked the appellant to turn around. The appellant turned off the road and into a drive-way that terminated in a closed gate.
	
	
	Whilst the van was stationary in the driveway on Foreshore Road, the complainant finished a cigarette she had been smoking and flicked it out of the window. Realising the area was surrounded by dry bush she opened the van door, intending to get out and extinguish the cigarette butt.
	
	
	The appellant grabbed the complainant by her neck and pulled her to him, kissing her. She pulled away, but he forcibly held her neck. He tried to kiss her on the mouth but the complainant again pulled away from him.
	
	
	The appellant shouted at the complainant to close the door, but she was unable to do so because of the appellant’s grip on her neck. She told him that she couldn’t, and he relaxed his grip slightly. She was then able to escape his hold on her and reached down to grab her bag and other possessions. The appellant immediately moved to the complainant’s side of the van and grabbed her again. He pulled her neck downwards, forcibly holding her in the van. The complainant felt frightened and, in the hope that it would make the appellant release her, she offered to have sex with him if he let her go.
	
	
	The appellant released her, and the complainant took the opportunity to kick out at the appellant, pinning him against the van door with her feet. The complainant grabbed her things and half jumped, half fell, from the van. The appellant pushed her backwards onto the scrubby bush beside the driveway. Grabbing the complainant’s knees, he tried to force her legs open. The complainant struggled against the appellant, screaming loudly for help.
	
	
	The complainant saw some bicyclists riding along the road and yelled for help. The appellant immediately got off her and backed away towards the front of the van, walking towards the driver side door. The complainant opened the passenger side door and retrieved a boot, and then ran across the road towards a group of golfers who were standing at a gate of a golf course situated on the other side of the road.
	
	
	One of the golfers, Mr Slowgrove, had been playing golf at Botany Golf Club. At about 7.15am he heard screaming. He walked with his companions to a clearing and noticed a van parked across the road. He heard a woman calling out, “Leave me alone. Get off me”, or something similar. He saw a woman at the back of the van calling, “Please stop. Help me”. He saw the woman run across the road and drop down on the footpath near him. She was very distressed, and complained, ‘The bastard tried to rape me’”. She said, “I should not have went with him. I’m an idiot” (T56:57).
	
	
	One of the bicyclists, Mr Townsend, observed that it was “quite obvious” that there was some sort of dispute between the man and the woman at the van. Stopping, he saw that the woman was “scrambling” to get away from the man. Although the road was quite busy, he saw her run across it without looking. He noted “the absolute sort of terror as she’s trying to get away” (T47:48).
	
	
	Another of the bicyclists, Mr Whiteman, heard the woman screaming for help. He looked at the man, who shrugged his shoulders. He then got back into the van and reversed out of the driveway onto Foreshore Road.
	
	
	Both Mr Townsend and Mr Whiteman recorded the number plate of the departing van. Mr Townsend also recorded a phone number from the van’s livery. Both men noted that the complainant was distraught, “rattled”, and screaming. She repeatedly complained that the appellant had tried to rape her. She said, “Stupid me. Why did I hop in the vehicle? I can’t believe I hopped in the vehicle”. She said that the man had offered her a lift home and that she should not have got in to the van. The complainant was observed to be bleeding from scratches on her arms and legs.
	
	
	The police were called to attend and arrived at the location soon after. At the scene, a pair of boots, a jacket, and a handbag were observed lying on the ground. The complainant was crying. She said, “He pushed me into a bush and I just screamed and kicked. I got away from him. I ran over here. He sped off” (T59).
	
	
	In the bushy area the complainant indicated to the police, the officers saw an area where the branches appeared to be lower than the rest of the plants, as if something had pushed them down.
	
	
	The complainant was taken by ambulance to St George Hospital. On examination by a doctor, she was noted to have multiple bruises and abrasions over her body. There were bruises present on her back, her right shoulder and above the right shoulder blade; there was an abrasion under the left shoulder blade. Two superficial abrasions were seen on the lower back, and there were multiple linear scratches on the back of the left thigh, together with four small linear scratches to the inner aspect of the left thigh. Further abrasions were present on the back of the right calf, and faint scratches could be seen on the back of the right thigh. The complainant’s right knee was red and swollen, as was the back of her right wrist. There was bruising in an ovoid or fingertip pattern on her left arm.
	
	
	The complainant was not observed to be intoxicated.
	
	
	Although possibly indicative of other mechanisms of injury, the injuries observed were regarded by the examining doctor as entirely consistent with the history given by the complainant of having been held down on a rough surface, and with having her legs forced apart.
	
	
	Police inquiries began immediately to locate the van and its driver. The van, a white Toyota Hi-Ace, was quickly traced through the vehicle registration number recorded by the bicyclists. The van’s owner advised police that he had loaned the van to “Alex” prior to Christmas 2012. The owner obtained the appellant’s name, address, and other contact details for Alex from a firm of couriers, for whom the appellant worked. He provided the appellant’s details to police.
	
	
	The van had been leased by the owner to the appellant for use as a courier vehicle. It had stickers affixed to the front and the back displaying the name “Urban Couriers”, and a phone number.
	
	
	The employee of the courier company from whom the van owner had obtained the appellant’s contact details sent a text message to the appellant that day querying what was wrong with the van. He responded that it had had a flat tyre since the previous day.
	
	
	Shortly after, the appellant contacted the van’s owner, claiming that the number plates of the Toyota Hi-ace had been stolen. The owner reported the theft to police.
	
	
	The appellant was contacted by police by telephone that day, 9 February 2013, and told that the police wished to speak to him about his van. He asked if the inquiry concerned the stolen number plates.
	
	
	At about 7.30pm on 9 February 2013 the appellant personally reported the theft of the number plates from his van. He told the officer who took the call, “I wanted to report my number plates were stolen. My van has been parked out the back and my friend rang me today and told me that police contacted him and that the plates were used in some things. I just checked and they have been stolen. I don’t know when it happened”. The appellant said, “It’s been parked there for a while and I just checked and the plates have been taken”. He provided his name, address and home phone number, and gave the stolen registration plate number as BVV 14N (T77).
	
	
	At about 7.45 that evening detectives attended the appellant’s address. They saw a white Toyota Hi-Ace in the rear yard of the premises, and saw that the van seemed to have had some recent work done on it. The rear passenger tyre had been removed and was lying on the grass next to the van, which had been jacked up. A number of wheel nuts, apparently freshly painted black, were nearby.
	
	
	When the appellant answered the door to the detectives’ knock, the officers saw that his head appeared freshly shaven. His scalp was smooth and shiny and appeared wet. It was much lighter than the skin of his face, neck and ears.
	
	
	When told that police were making inquiries about a white van that had been used in an attempted sexual assault earlier that day, the appellant claimed that the Hi-Ace had been sitting with its tyres off in his yard for some time. He said that he had noticed the number plates missing from the van earlier that afternoon. On arrest, the appellant expressed disbelief, saying, “What? Me? This is unbelievable. Are you kidding?” (T97; T103). He refused to be interviewed.
	
	
	Later that same night a search warrant was executed at the appellant’s home. The van, without number plates, was still parked in the yard. On searching the house police located a set of NSW registration plates BVV 14N wrapped in a shopping bag inside a drawer beneath clothing in the bedroom used by the son of the appellant’s girlfriend. Inside a waste bin in the bathroom of the premises a quantity of black hair clippings were found.
	
	
	Images later obtained by police from closed circuit security cameras in operation on 8 and 9 February 2013 at each of the Captain Cook Hotel and the Waterworks Hotel showed the appellant with a head of hair at 12.09am and 12.25am, respectively, on 9 February 2013.
	
	
	On 16 February 2013 the white Toyota Hi-Ace van was examined by a crime scene officer. It appeared that the front of the van had been scrubbed, or subjected to some sort of abrasive action, in the very recent past. The van was not displaying any sticker or other livery with a telephone number for Urban Couriers. Footage taken on 1 February 2013 was obtained from security cameras that showed the rear of the van BVV 14N with an Urban Couriers label visible.
	


Tendency evidence adduced by the Crown at Trial


	
	At trial, the Crown asserted that the appellant had a tendency or tendencies to behave in a particular way. The asserted tendencies were:
	



	
	To prey upon young women who were vulnerable by virtue of being alone in the early hours of the morning, in the street, after a night out;
	
	
	To approach such women and ingratiate himself with them;
	
	
	To offer transport to their destination;
	
	
	To isolate or attempt to isolate them;
	
	
	To do so in geographical areas close to his home and familiar to him;
	
	
	To touch or attempt to touch them in the area of the vagina; and
	
	
	To use physical force to restrain them when rebuffed.
	



	
	These tendencies were said to be established by the facts of a single event that had occurred on 14 April 2006, an event which had led to the appellant being charged with indecent assault (an offence to which he had pleaded guilty). A document setting out the agreed facts of the incident was tendered before the jury (Ex. R).
	
	
	The facts of that incident were that, in the early hours of 14 April 2006 the applicant, who had been standing at a bus stop on Anzac Parade at Kingsford, spoke to a young woman who was walking home to Kingsford after a night out drinking. The appellant asked the victim for a light but she did not have one. He then suggested that they share a taxi but she refused. She told him a bus was due in five minutes. When the bus arrived soon after, both boarded.
	
	
	After a short trip the complainant got off the bus. The appellant followed her. As she stood waiting at traffic lights to cross the road he approached her, again asking her for a light. She again said no. The two walked in the same direction along Beauchamp Road, with the appellant continuing to try to engage the complainant in conversation.
	
	
	As they approached an intersection, the complainant said goodbye. The appellant made his third request for a light and, when the complainant again said she could not give him a light, he grabbed both her hands. She protested, but the appellant lifted her skirt and put his hand on her vagina on the outside of her underwear.
	
	
	The complainant managed to free one of her hands and pulled her skirt down. The appellant lifted her onto his shoulder and carried her up the street. She kicked and punched the appellant until he put her down. Almost immediately he picked the complainant up again. When she began screaming for help the appellant put her down and ran off. The appellant was later identified by a DNA match.
	


The Appellant’s Case at Trial


	
	The appellant gave evidence at his trial.
	
	
	He did not dispute having picked the complainant up when driving in the early hours of 9 February 2013, and did not dispute that he had physically assaulted her (a fact he acknowledged by the plea of guilty entered to the relevant charge). He denied, however, that his intent had been sexual, and claimed that he had instead been trying to get the complainant out of his van.
	
	
	The appellant told the jury that he went out on the evening of 8 February 2013 to the Captain Cook Hotel on Botany Road at Botany, and then to the Waterworks Hotel. He said that he left the hotel alone at about 4am (with security footage from the latter hotel showing him there until 4.30am).
	
	
	Having driven to the hotel, he slept in the van for a time, in case he was in excess of the alcohol limit for drivers, before beginning the drive home at sunrise. He detoured on the way to get a soft drink from a specialist South American shop at Kingsford, but thought better of it before he arrived at the shop, and turned into a driveway intending to turn around and go home. He deposed that, as he stopped in the driveway, but before he could reverse out of it to turn around, the complainant walked up to his van and appeared to be about to speak to him. He wound down the van’s window and asked her if she was lost.
	
	
	The appellant said that, without replying, the complainant opened the front passenger door of the van and got in. She asked him to take her to Hillsdale. The appellant agreed.
	
	
	The appellant thought that the complainant was drunk or affected by drugs. He told her he would drop her off on his way to Maroubra. The appellant told the jury that the complainant said she had been drinking all night, and using cannabis, and had been with some men who had asked her for sex.
	
	
	The appellant suggested that he drop her off at a particular bus stop, but she refused, asking to be driven further. He said that she had offered to make it worth his while if he took her for a drive or drove her home. The appellant refused the offer, saying he would take her home.
	
	
	The Appellant drove on, asking for directions from time to time. After having driven beyond Hillsdale, he stopped and queried where he was taking the complainant. She told him, “It’s just a little bit further”. She mentioned that she lived in Botany, and the appellant ended up on Foreshore Road.
	
	
	The appellant said that he had become concerned at the length of the drive, and told the complainant he was turning back. He said that, when he drove into a driveway to turn around, the complainant grabbed the steering wheel and told him to stop. The appellant told her she was a crazy bitch. When she offered him sex if they went for a drive, the appellant said that he refused and told her to get out of the van. The complainant ignored him. The appellant leant over her and opened the passenger side door, insisting she get out. When she did not, he pushed her, and then pushed her harder. He said that he pushed her by her arms and her leg near her knee (T132-133).
	
	
	When the complainant remained seated in the van the appellant deposed that he got out of the vehicle and walked around to the passenger door. Having asked the complainant again to get out without result, the appellant grabbed the complainant by the wrists and attempted to pull her hands off the dashboard, which she was holding. When unsuccessful at removing her from the van the appellant described a “scooping” motion whereby he took hold of the complainant’s legs and quickly pulled her from the van. He claimed that she fell out, landing on her buttocks in bushes near the driveway. It was then that the appellant saw some people cycling by. He heard the complainant yell for help. He told her not to forget her stuff and saw her retrieve her things from the van and walk across the road. He noticed that her legs were red and bleeding and became concerned that he would get into trouble with the police.
	
	
	Noticing one of the van’s tyres was a little flat, he drove home slowly.
	
	
	He acknowledged having removed the number plates from the van and falsely reported them stolen. He also admitted having removed Urban Couriers stickers from the exterior of the van and shaving his head to change his appearance. He claimed to have done these things because he was fearful that he would get into trouble with police for having pulled the complainant from the van and hurt her.
	
	
	He explained his “paranoia” about getting into trouble with police by reference to the fact that he was on parole at the time of the incident, and was fearful of being returned to prison.
	
	
	The appellant conceded in cross-examination that the area where he had turned into the driveway was an isolated area on Foreshore Road.
	
	
	As to the incident led by the Crown as tendency evidence, the appellant conceded that he had entered a plea of guilty to the relevant offence, but said that he had no memory of the events, as he was stressed and drinking large amounts of alcohol at the time.
	
	
	He acknowledged that there were some similarities between the conduct alleged against him and that of which he had previously been convicted, although he later denied that proposition.
	


The Appeal


	
	The appellant advanced two grounds of appeal.
	



	
	The learned trial judge erred in admitting the tendency evidence against the appellant.
	
	
	The learned trial judge failed to put the defence case to the jury and thereby occasioned a miscarriage of justice.
	


Ground 1: The learned trial judge erred in admitting tendency evidence against the appellant

A Preliminary Question of Leave


	
	As a ground raising a question of law alone, leave would not ordinarily be required to argue it: s 5(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act. However, there was a preliminary question in this matter as to whether leave was in fact necessary because of the operation of r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.
	
	
	Rule 4 is in these terms.
	


4 Exclusion of certain matters as grounds for appeal etc

No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.


	
	The Crown contended that the appellant had not taken objection to the admission of the tendency evidence pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”), instead confining his objection to s 101, and thus r 4 applied to the ground as framed. The appellant contended that leave was not required as objection had been taken to the evidence at trial on the twofold basis that it did not satisfy the requirements of either s 97 or s 101 of the Act.
	
	
	The original Notice served upon the appellant by the Crown notifying him of its intention to adduce “tendency evidence” pursuant to s 97 of the Act was in very broad terms, asserting a tendency to assault females in a sexual or indecent way. The appellant objected to the evidence sought to be led to establish a tendency of that nature, arguing that the evidence met neither the test at s 97 of the Act nor that at s 101.
	
	
	The trial judge thereafter granted leave to the Crown to amend the tendency notice, to better particularise the tendency the evidence was said to establish. An amended notice was subsequently served on the appellant, asserting tendencies as set out at [37] above. The appellant thereafter appeared to concede that the evidence was admissible pursuant to s 97, but maintained his objection on the basis that the evidence could not meet the s 101 test.
	
	
	The Crown argued before this Court that, having confined his objection to the admission of the evidence to a contention that it could not satisfy s 101 of the Act, r 4 precluded the appellant from making the broader complaint mounted before this Court, without obtaining leave to do so.
	
	
	There is authority supportive of an argument of that nature: Bin Sulaeman v R [2013] NSWCCA 283; Shepherd v R [2011] NSWCCA 245; Vickers v R [2006] NSWCCA 60; (2006) 160 A Crim R 195.
	
	
	In Poniris v R [2014] NSWCCA 100 Macfarlan JA referred to each of those decisions when determining whether r 4 applied to a ground of appeal advancing an objection to evidence pursuant to s 137 of the Act, when the objection taken at trial had been based on relevance. His Honour said at [55] (with the agreement of Adamson and Bellew JJ),
	


“In my view the objection as to relevance cannot suffice to allow objections on any basis to be advanced on appeal without first obtaining leave. To hold otherwise would be contrary to the purpose of r 4 and the discouragement of “armchair appeals” which that provision seeks to achieve (see Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62; 209 A Crim R 424 at [169] – [170]; Flanagan v R [2013] NSWCCA 320 at [69]-[72]). It would also undermine basic principles of appellate review and the efficient administration of justice.”


	
	If the Crown’s contention that the appellant conceded the s 97 argument is correct, r 4 applies, and the appellant would require the leave of this Court to advance this ground.
	
	
	However, whilst the argument that the appellant requires the Court’s leave to advance this ground has some superficial attraction, careful reading of the transcript of the voir dire hearing and of the arguments before the trial judge concerning the admissibility of tendency evidence, make it less so.
	
	
	During argument on the voir dire some relatively general objection to the capacity of the evidence to meet the requirements of s 97 was raised by trial counsel for the appellant. Whilst but faint opposition to the admissibility of the evidence was mounted, the issue was raised. It was contended by the appellant that the evidence of the 2006 incident was not capable of establishing a tendency to act in a particular way, as required by s 97.
	
	
	Counsel then moved quickly to the argument that the evidence did not meet the requirements of s 101, apparently on the basis that he considered it as having more prospects of being accepted by the trial judge.
	
	
	That is, his concession (quickly given) was that the evidence would be found by the trial judge to satisfy the requirements of s 97, as opposed to a concession that it was admissible per se.
	
	
	That there could be such a degree of confusion before this Court as to what the appellant’s argument was before the trial judge, and what concessions were made by him, points to the need for counsel at trial to firmly and clearly articulate any position taken on the admissibility of evidence (or on the need for re-direction), lest r 4 be considered to apply to any subsequent argument on appeal.
	
	
	Given that the point was taken here, albeit faintly and without clarity, leave is not required to advance this ground.
	


The Arguments of the Parties


	
	The appellant contended that the evidence of a single incident, remote in time, and which was in many respects factually dissimilar to the allegations aired at trial, was incapable of establishing that the appellant had any of the tendencies particularised by the Crown.
	
	
	It was argued that, as the facts of the assault upon the complainant were in contention, and were not confirmed by evidence independent of the complainant, the facts of the 2006 indecent assault had little or no probative value relevant to the facts in issue at trial, since any comparison between the established incident and the alleged incident must necessarily proceed on the assumption that the latter had been established.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the facts of the 2006 incident, as a single episode of opportunistic conduct are factually dissimilar from the present allegation, could prove no more than the appellant’s prior misdeed, as opposed to a tendency to act in a particular way. The singularity of the earlier crime deprived it of any real probative value, and certainly of probative value which outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant, leading to a conclusion that the evidence should not have been admitted at trial.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the 2006 offence, whilst the only incident available to establish a particular tendency, was capable nevertheless of establishing a modus operandi of deliberate and patient conduct in pursuing a purpose of sexually interfering with a woman who was in isolated circumstances. That is, the evidence was capable of establishing both a tendency to act in a particular way, and to do so with a particular state of mind. The Crown submitted that the evidence was properly admitted by the trial judge.
	


Consideration


	
	Section 97 of the Act provides, relevantly:
	


The tendency rule 

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

(2) […].


	
	In his judgment on the voir dire the trial judge identified the facts in issue in the trial to which the evidence of the 2006 incident was directed, and of which it was said to be probative. They were the question of the appellant’s intention towards the complainant, and the nature of the assault he committed upon her. Each of these issues fell to be assessed by the jury in a context where the appellant had acknowledged having assaulted the complainant by his plea to the charge brought against him pursuant to s 59 of the Crimes Act, but disputed any sexual act or intention in so doing.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that the evidence was capable of rationally affecting the probability of the facts in issue (s 55 of the Act). He also determined that the evidence had the capacity to establish that the appellant had the particularised tendencies, and that the existence of such tendencies had significant probative value. It was thus “tendency evidence” for the purpose of s 97.
	
	
	The trial judge correctly noted that the fact that a single incident was relied upon to establish that the appellant had the particular tendencies was a feature relevant to considerations of admissibility, but not determinative of it. He made a similar observation as to the lapse of time between the 2006 incident and the allegations at trial. Both of these features could militate against the admissibility of the evidence of the 2006 incident, but did not necessarily do so. His Honour concluded that the evidence was tendency evidence. In that this evidence had the capacity to inform the jury’s assessment of the two facts in issue – the nature of the assault the appellant acknowledged having committed upon the complainant, and his intention at the time – the trial judge concluded that the evidence had significant probative value.
	
	
	Whilst the trial judge did not set out the reasons for his conclusions in this regard at exhaustive or even great length, that was no doubt because of what he had understood to be the appellant’s concession, that the evidence had significant probative value. That misapprehension was induced by the failure of trial counsel to clearly articulate either his objection to the admission of the evidence, or the basis upon which objection was taken.
	
	
	It is important to observe that his Honour’s conclusion as to the probative value of the evidence was not based upon any “concession” as referred to in the preceding paragraph but resulted from his own independent assessment as to the nature of the tendency evidence including in particular its capacity to establish particular matters such as those identified below: see para [93].
	
	
	Tendency evidence has previously been referred to by this Court as a “building block” or “stepping stone” which provides a foundation for an inference to be drawn that an accused person has acted in a particular way or had a particular state of mind on another relevant occasion: DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63 at [179] per Simpson J (as her Honour then was). Her Honour continued,
	


“The foundation provided by the tendency evidence may be strong or weak, depending upon the nature of the evidence. The only qualification is that, to be admissible, its probative value must not be so weak as to be bereft of ""significance"". The level of generality of the evidence may affect the significance of its probative value: Townsend v Townsend [2001] NSWCA 136; Ibrahim v Pham [2007] NSWCA 215; Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; 273 ALR 286 at [53].”


	
	It is not necessary, for evidence to be admissible as tendency evidence, that the conduct occur on a number of occasions so as to evince a particular pattern of behaviour or a modus operandi. As Campbell JA explained in R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; 201 A Crim R 451 at [45]:
	


“… It is possible for a person to have a tendency to act in a particular way even if that tendency has not shown to be manifested on very many occasions. The forensic purpose of its tender is to prove that the Respondent has a tendency to act in a particular way, namely that identified in the tendency notice ... Thus, the evidence falls within the chapeau of section 97(1) and will be inadmissible unless the requirements of paras (a) and (b) of section 97(1) are met, and the requirements of section 101(2) are also met.”


	
	In Ford, Campbell JA further stated:
	


“125   … there is no need for there to be a ‘striking pattern of similarity between the incidents’. All that is necessary is that the disputed evidence should make more likely, to a significant extent, the facts that make up the elements of the offence charged. In my view, it meets that test.

126   The respondent submits that ‘the phenomenon of young women, who are drunkenly sleeping after a social event, being the subject of sexual interference is unfortunately not so compellingly rare or exceptional as to give the evidence significant probative value’. I do not accept that tendency evidence has to be of a tendency to do an act that is ‘compellingly rare or exceptional’ before it can have significant probative value.”


	
	His Honour’s remarks have been endorsed in later decisions of this Court: see FB v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 217 at [26]; Saoud v The Queen [2014] NSWCCA 136; 87 NSWLR 481 at [40].
	
	
	Although neither case expressly refers to tendency evidence relating to a single incident, as is the case here, it is apparent from their Honours’ respective remarks that a single incident is not for that reason precluded. A single incident some years before may provide a weaker foundation than might have been the case for a tendency sought to be proved by evidence of multiple instances of relevant conduct or conduct that had occurred in the more recent past to the event in issue. However, such considerations did not deprive the evidence in this case of significance in the sense contemplated by s 97 and considered in R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 and R v Lock (1997) 91 A Crim R 356.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the relative brevity of the reasons given by the trial judge, we do not regard him as having determined that aspect of the issue by reference to some mistaken principle, or other error of the nature contemplated by House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499.
	
	
	The trial judge next turned to consider the test set by s 101 of the Act. Section 101 provides, relevantly:
	


101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.

(3) […]

(4) […].


	
	In approaching this aspect of the matter the trial judge noted the obligation upon him to assess whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect that might flow to the appellant. His Honour noted that,
	


“… the evidence is prejudicial, highly so, but this in effect underlines its significant probative value” (p.9 of Judgment on 19 March 2014).


	
	The trial judge identified the following features as being of particular probative value:
	



	
	The capacity of the evidence to inform the jury of the appellant’s state of mind at the time of the assault;
	
	
	Its capacity to characterise the quality and nature of the assault; and
	
	
	Its capacity to inform the assessment made by the jury of the complainant’s evidence, and of the evidence of those witnesses to whom she had made complaint.
	



	
	His Honour was cognisant of the need to address the question of whether the evidence was so unfairly prejudicial that its probative value could not be said to substantially outweigh that prejudice. Having considered the probative value of the evidence to be high, the trial judge concluded that its value in that regard substantially outweighed the prejudicial effect.
	
	
	Indeed, his Honour went further and assessed the admissibility of the evidence by applying the more stringent test set out in Pfennig v R [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461, a test that dealt with issues of admissibility at common law and which has no application to the admissibility of evidence pursuant to the Evidence Act. Applying the higher test, the trial judge concluded that “there would be no reasonable view of the [tendency] evidence that was consistent with the innocence of the accused” (p.11 of Judgment on 19 March 2014).
	
	
	Whilst the Pfennig test was not apposite, in that it imposed a higher test for the Crown to meet in seeking to adduce the evidence than was required, there was no disadvantage to the appellant in his Honour’s reference to it.
	
	
	It is our view that his Honour correctly weighed the competing considerations raised by s 101 of the Act, and appropriately determined the admissibility of the evidence in a principled way. There was no error in the decision of the trial judge to admit the evidence. In a trial where the critical issues for the determination of the jury were the nature of the assault upon the complainant by the appellant, and the question of his intention at the time, the probative value of the tendency evidence was very high. It was capable of both assisting the jury to determine those matters and, additionally, to rebut the accused’s contention, implicit in his plea of guilty to the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, that he had not done or intended anything of a sexual nature to the complainant.
	
	
	This ground should be dismissed.
	


Ground 2: The learned trial judge failed to put the defence case to the jury and thereby occasioned a miscarriage of justice


	
	The appellant contends that the trial judge did not put the defence case to the jury.
	
	
	This complaint was not raised by the appellant at trial and, accordingly, r 4 applied. The question of leave will be dealt with below.
	
	
	The appellant argued that only a “passing reference” was made to some aspects of the evidence which he relied upon, rather than giving a summary of sufficient depth to ensure that the appellant’s case was understood by the jury.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that, for the trial judge to comply with the obligation to put the defence case to the jury, it was necessary in the context of this case to summarise the appellant’s evidence to the jury, and to instruct the jurors to acquit the appellant if that evidence was accepted; to remind the jury of the appellant’s denial of having indecently assaulted the complainant or of intending to have sexual intercourse with her; to advise the jury that the plea of guilty to the s 59 charge was not a concession that the indecent assault had occurred; to detail “implausibility and inconsistencies” in the complainant’s evidence; and to advise the jury to consider the reliability of the complainant in light of her state of intoxication.
	
	
	The appellant contrasted what is characterised as an “intelligible summary” of the Crown case by the trial judge with the asserted inadequacies of his Honour’s account of the appellant’s case.
	
	
	There is no question that the directions given by the trial judge to the jury during the course of the summing up principally dealt with evidence led in the Crown case. However, that does not of itself bespeak error.
	
	
	Whether or not a party’s case has been adequately put to the jury is not to be measured in minutes spent, or the number of words spoken; nor can it be assessed by direct comparison with the attention given by the trial judge in his or her summary of the case brought by the opposing party. Fairness and balance is not achieved and cannot be gauged by such means.
	
	
	That is particularly the case where the opposing party is the Crown. It is almost axiomatic that, in a criminal trial, the Crown’s case will constitute the vast majority, if not the whole, of the evidence placed before the jury. Necessarily, in such a case, in giving the jury directions as to how to approach the evidence before it, and how to apply the relevant law to that evidence, greater time and attention will be given to the Crown case than to any case called for the accused. That was the case here.
	
	
	The obligation on a trial judge is to fairly and accurately put the respective cases for the Crown and the accused to the jury, as was noted by the High Court in in Domican v R [1992] HCA 13; 173 CLR 555 at [561]:
	


“Nevertheless, the requirement of fairness means that ordinarily the respective cases for the prosecution and the accused must be accurately and fairly put to the jury. But that requirement does not oblige the judge to put to the jury every argument put forward by counsel for the accused. This Court has said that it ""is hardly necessary to say that as a reason for granting a new trial, after a conviction in a criminal case, it is not enough that the presiding judge has not mentioned to the jury all the matters which were set up on behalf of the accused as affecting probabilities"". Whether the trial judge is bound to refer to an evidentiary matter or argument ultimately depends upon whether a reference to that matter or argument is necessary to ensure that the jurors have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the evidence to discharge their duty to determine the case according to the evidence. Consequently, the conduct of the case necessarily bears on the extent to which the judge is bound to comment on or discuss the evidence. Discussion or comment which is justified or required in one case may be neither required nor justified when a similar case is conducted in a different way.”


	
	Whether that obligation has been met falls to be assessed in light of the nature of the trial, its length and complexity, and by reference to the way in which the parties have conducted their respective cases.
	
	
	The question ultimately is whether the trial judge put an accused’s case in such a way as to allow a jury to properly consider the issues raised on the accused’s behalf: R v Malone (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), Blanch J, 20 April 1994, unrep). There is no standard formula against which the instructions given in any particular trial may be measured. As was stated in Cleland v The Queen [1982] HCA 67; 151 CLR 1 by Gibbs CJ (with whom Wilson and Dawson JJ agreed on this issue) at [10],
	


“It is clear in principle that a trial judge, when directing a jury in a criminal trial, must hold an even balance between the cases of the prosecution and the accused and must fairly direct the consideration of the jury to the matters raised by the accused in his defence. In what manner, and in what detail, this should be done must of course depend on the circumstances of each case.”


	
	The appellant’s trial was of short duration, with the evidence occupying little more than three days. The majority of the evidence led was called by the Crown. The issues for the determination of the jury were very straightforward and there could have been no misapprehension about them.
	
	
	The trial judge referred to the evidence principally in the context of giving particular directions. Whilst he did not, as the appellant points out, summarise the evidence given to the jury by the appellant, his Honour was not required to do so. Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1999 (NSW) provides:
	


161 Summary by Judge

(1) At the end of a criminal trial before a jury, a Judge need not summarise the evidence given in the trial if of the opinion that, in all the circumstances of the trial, a summary is not necessary.

(2) This section applies despite any rule of law or practice to the contrary.

(3) Nothing in this section affects any aspect of a Judge’s summing up function other than the summary of evidence in a trial.


	
	The trial judge indicated that he did not intend to summarise the evidence, and no issue was taken with that approach by the appellant at trial. Given the short duration of the trial, and the absence of any complexity in the case for the appellant, that approach was open to the trial judge. How an accused’s case is put to the jury during a summing up is a matter for the trial judge, subject always to meeting the court’s obligation to ensure that an accused person receives a fair trial.
	
	
	Those present at the trial – the trial judge, the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the accused – are ordinarily in the best position to determine what is necessary in the context of an individual case. Much will depend upon the individual case. The trial judge, with the assistance of counsel, is well placed to assess the difficulties of any evidentiary or legal issues that have arisen, to consider the apparent comprehension of the jury (always evident to those present), and to decide what is required to assist the jury in its deliberations, without needlessly repeating evidence and submissions to a jury who has heard both. It is both contemptuous of the ordinary intelligence of those who serve on the jury, and unduly wasteful of the resources of the courts, for trial judges to add a lengthy summing up to what may have been a short trial.
	
	
	In RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3; 199 CLR 62,0 Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said at [41]:
	


“[…] it is as well to say something more general about the difficult task trial judges have in giving juries proper instructions. The fundamental task of a trial judge is, of course, to ensure a fair trial of the accused. That will require the judge to instruct the jury about so much of the law as they need to know in order to dispose of the issues in the case. No doubt that will require instructions about the elements of the offence, the burden and standard of proof and the respective functions of judge and jury. Subject to any applicable statutory provisions it will require the judge to identify the issues in the case and to relate the law to those issues. It will require the judge to put fairly before the jury the case which the accused makes.”


	
	These are matters very much for the trial judge, within the confines of the dictates of fairness.
	
	
	The appellant’s case at trial was, to deny the complainant’s allegations, to give his account of what had happened between him and the complainant, and to explain his conduct after the incident by reference to his fear of being returned to gaol because of the physical assault he had perpetrated on the complainant. The trial judge reminded the jury of the appellant’s evidence as to how and why he had sought to remove the complainant from his van; more was not necessary.
	
	
	During the course of the summing up, the trial judge gave the jury directions of direct relevance to the task of considering the appellant’s case.
	



	
	The jury was told in clear terms that the applicant had pleaded not guilty to the charges involving a sexual element, and was not guilty unless the Crown proved otherwise to the requisite standard.
	
	
	The jury was reminded that counsel had addressed them, and directed to consider the submissions made to them by the parties.
	
	
	It was stressed that the burden of proof was on the Crown and the applicant did not have to prove any fact or issue at all.
	
	
	The jury was told that it was necessary to exercise caution when assessing the complainant’s evidence, and to approach it with great care. This direction, in accordance with R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12, was not required: s 294AA of the Criminal Procedure Act. That the jury were directed in this way was favourable to the appellant. It was not necessary for the trial judge to go further in relation to the issue of the complainant’s purported intoxication. The appellant did not seek a direction in accordance with s 165 of the Act and, arguably, it would not have assisted the appellant for his Honour to point specifically to the appellant’s claim that the complainant was intoxicated, since it was not supported by any other witness, including police officers and a doctor who spoke with the complainant.
	
	
	The trial judge reminded the jury that the appellant had given evidence and referred to his account of having assaulted the complainant by “scooping” her out of the van in an attempt to remove her from his vehicle. This evidence was the foundation of the appellant’s case.
	
	
	He similarly reminded the jury of the appellant’s evidence as to his status as a parolee, and his consequent fear of arrest and incarceration, setting the evidence of consciousness of guilt that had been led by the Crown in a context favourable to the appellant.
	
	
	His Honour referred to the address by the appellant’s counsel at trial, and reminded the jurors of the points that had been made.
	



	
	On considering the whole of the summing up, we consider that the trial judge adequately put the appellant’s case to the jury, and instructed the jury in relation to the relevant law. There was no failure in this regard.
	
	
	That the appellant’s counsel at trial considered that his Honour’s summary and directions was sufficient in the context of the trial as it was conducted, and against the atmosphere of the trial as counsel had experienced it, is indicated by the fact that there was no application for more to be said.
	
	
	That trial counsel did not see a need for further directions to the jury suggests that there was no need for that to occur:
	
	
	Although it is true, as the High Court said in Pemble v R [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107, that in a criminal trial the judge must be astute to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law, none the less, as has been pointed out on many occasions and over a great many years, the fact that no objection is taken to a procedural step adopted by the trial judge, or to matters put or omitted by him in his summing up, is cogent evidence indeed, in most cases, that counsel absorbed in the atmosphere of the trial saw no injustice or error in what was done: R v Tripodina (1988) 35 A Crim R 183, at 191, per Yeldham J (with whom Carruthers and McInerney JJ agreed).
	
	
	His Honour can not reasonably be criticised for not doing that which he was not asked to do and which was, in our view, quite unnecessary in the overall context of the trial.
	
	
	Because no request was made of the trial judge for further directions to the jury, r 4 applies to this ground and the appellant must obtain the leave of the Court to advance it. Rule 4 is to be given its full effect, as has frequently been held in this Court. In R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 Hunt J (Gleeson CJ and Mahoney JA agreeing) stated, at 536:
	


“The requirements of r 4 do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside”

See also Germakian v R [2007] NSWCCA 373; 70 NSWLR 467, at [10]; FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182; and Ward v R [2013] NSWCCA 46 at [26]-[34], for example.


	
	In our judgment, there has been no error which constitutes such a departure from the essential requirements the law imposes as to go to the root of proceedings. The appellant has failed to establish a possibility that real injustice has occurred: Tripodina at 195.
	
	
	Leave should not be granted to advance this ground.
	


ORDERS


	
	The orders of the Court are:
	



	
	Refuse leave to appeal in respect of ground 2 of the notice of appeal.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

2768251,El-Hilli v R; Melville v R [2015] NSWCCA 289,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: The applicants, Issam El-Hilli and Jenny Samantha Melville, were convicted in the District Court on two counts of obtaining a financial advantage through deception, under s 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The trial was conducted before North DCJ, sitting without a jury. The applicants appeared for themselves, both at trial and in this Court. Indeed, in this Court Mr El-Hilli filed written submissions, but did not appear at the hearing, being content to adopt the arguments put by Ms Melville.
	
	
	The trial commenced on 20 May 2014 and concluded with a judgment delivered on 15 July 2014. Each accused was found guilty on each count on the indictment. The proceedings were stood over for sentencing. On 16 December 2014, each was convicted and sentenced: Ms Melville was sentenced to an effective term of two years three months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of one year three months. Mr El-Hilli was sentenced to an effective term of five years, with a non-parole period of four years two months. Ms Melville is entitled to be released on parole on 15 March 2016; Mr El-Hilli becomes eligible for release on parole on 15 February 2017.
	
	
	The applicants seek leave to appeal against their convictions and sentences. (The grounds of appeal against conviction, not raising questions of law alone, require leave. [1] )
	


Background


	
	The charges arose out of two separate courses of conduct following a similar pattern. All of the activity took place between 1 August 2008 and 8 November 2008. In broad terms, Mr El-Hilli held himself out as having access to significant sums of capital from a wealthy sheikh, which could be made available to business people in financial stress, who were presumably without access to funds from conventional lenders. Ms Melville was the agent who negotiated proposed loan transactions between Mr El-Hilli and the borrowers. She was paid a fee to secure and guarantee the loans, the fees being paid in advance. Once the fees were paid the applicants left the country. The loan funds were not provided, nor were the fees repaid.
	
	
	The first count related to Craig Kenway, a Queensland businessman who had substantial debts. The proposed loan was for an amount of €18.5 million. The loan was subject to the payment of a 2% fee ($800,000) to Ms Melville. Through a financial consultant, Clinton Sarina, engaged by Ms Melville, the borrower was able to obtain a loan from another lender, Community Life Pty Ltd, in order to pay the 2% fee to Ms Melville. In fact, only half that amount was actually transferred to Ms Melville and deposited by her in a cheque account with the ANZ Bank.
	
	
	The second arrangement was with Ms Maria Duncombe, who required finance for a development project. The agreed loan was in an amount of €55 million, the proposed fee being $2 million. That amount was reduced to $200,000 and, through the same intermediaries, the money was paid to Ms Melville and deposited in her cheque account. Melville and El-Hilli left Australia on 20 November 2008. The funds in Ms Melville’s account were dissipated.
	


The issues on appeal


	
	It is convenient to refer first to the grounds relied on by Mr El-Hilli. All except ground (3) were common to the “final submissions” made on his behalf and dated 6 July 2015 and a similarly entitled document of the same date filed by Ms Melville. Mr El-Hilli’s grounds, not reproduced verbatim, but removing infelicities of expression, were as follows:
	


The trial judge erred –

(1)   in not informing the appellant of his right to apply for an adjournment or stay of proceedings until legal representation was obtained;

(2)   in failing to give a ruling prior to the commencement of the trial on the admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence;

(3)   admitting (and relying upon) evidence of a prior conviction of the appellant in 2003 as coincidence evidence having significant probative value of his state of mind with respect to the present charges;

…

(5)   erroneously admitting incomplete copies of the contracts, not being original documents and missing important terms, and

(6)   errors of law and directions, constituting a miscarriage of justice.

The omitted ground (4) referred to “prosecutorial misconduct”. The submissions indicated that the prosecutor reversed the onus of proof, injected speculative inferences and invented hypothesised evidence. These submissions referred to questions asked of the applicants in the course of cross-examination. It was further submitted that during the course of the trial the applicants were ridiculed, belittled and their evidence treated with disdain by the prosecutor.


	
	Ms Melville’s grounds included the five common grounds referred to above, which were grounds (1), (2), (6), (7) and (8) in her “final submissions”. [2]  In ground (2), dealing with tendency and coincidence evidence, Ms Melville added a paragraph (a), which complained of the trial judge “not advising the Appellant effectively as to the mutated direction that ‘Tendency’ evidence could take resulting in a finding of co-offenders ‘state of mind’ assigning further unchallenged prejudice against the Appellant”. The written submissions in support of this ground did not greatly clarify its meaning. However, it may perhaps be understood as a complaint that the inferences drawn from Mr El-Hilli’s 2003 convictions, relating to his state of mind, caused prejudice to Ms Melville, who was not involved in the 2003 offending. (The same submissions were made in writing on behalf of Mr El-Hilli, although his grounds were not amended to include par (a); it appears to add nothing of substance to the ground with respect to his case.)
	
	
	Ms Melville relied upon three further grounds which are also difficult to follow, but were, with minor changes:
	


The trial judge erred in –

(3)   “not bequeathing a statutory ruling on separate trial application on behalf of the Appellant”;

(4)   “not giving due consideration to the Appellants trepidations of the prejudiced investigation against her lead by the Officer in Charge”, and

(5)   “morphed co-accused ‘state of mind’ and coincidence evidence to develop an unlawful inference giving eminence to a Joint Criminal Enterprise.”


	
	Ms Melville’s ground (4) was not clarified in her written submissions and, as formulated by her, has no obvious content. It will not be addressed further. Separate grounds were identified by each in respect of their applications for leave to appeal against sentence, which will be dealt with separately below.
	
	
	It will be necessary to deal with each of the grounds raised, having regard to the written submissions and the further oral submissions made by Ms Melville. (This Court accepted, with the express agreement of Mr El-Hilli, that submissions made by Ms Melville should be treated, where relevant, as supportive of his grounds of appeal, as well as hers.) Nevertheless, it is fair to say that the central issue (and perhaps the only allegation which was reasonably arguable) concerned the manner in which the judge dealt with Mr El-Hilli’s 2003 convictions, as tendency or coincidence evidence or as evidence of his “state of mind”. First, however, it is convenient to address the ground relating to legal representation.
	


Failure to advise as to right to representation (ground 1)


	
	Ground (1) was apparently drafted with some care: it did not assert that the applicants had a right to a stay of proceedings until legal representation was obtained, but rather that they had a right to be advised by the trial judge of their entitlement to apply for an adjournment or a stay pending each obtaining legal representation. Formulated in this way, the ground eschewed, no doubt correctly, [3]  asserting a right to representation, nor even a right to an adjournment to allow them a reasonable opportunity to seek representation (which may, in appropriate circumstances, have been tenable [4] ) but was limited to a right, as an unrepresented party, to be advised that such a course was open. The careful formulation of the ground may, even so, have missed a critical element, in that the failure to give the advice must, in order to provide a basis for setting aside a conviction, have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. [5] 
	
	
	As the applicants’ submissions acknowledged, they had applied, unsuccessfully, for legal aid and had taken an appeal from its refusal (also unsuccessful) to the Legal Aid Review Committee. They had informed the District Court of those facts and requested that a trial date be fixed on the basis that they would be self-represented.
	
	
	In accordance with current practice, questions of representation will be addressed at a pre-trial hearing (although things may change). It is not helpful to identify a “right” for an unrepresented accused to be advised that he or she may seek an adjournment to obtain representation. Where an accused appears unrepresented, it is common practice for the judge conducting the preliminary hearing to inquire as to the circumstances giving rise to that situation. That will usually involve a more nuanced inquiry than the proposed “advice”.
	
	
	That occurred in the present case. The proceedings were mentioned before Huggett DCJ on four occasions before the trial commenced before North DCJ. On the first day, both accused stated that they wished to remain self-represented, but Ms Melville sought leave to appear both for herself and for Mr El-Hilli. Having ascertained that the trial was based on a joint criminal enterprise, the judge declined to let Ms Melville appear on behalf of both accused. Mr El-Hilli objected saying “I can’t represent myself” to which the judge replied, “Well, then you’ll need to get legal representation …”.
	
	
	Noting that there was an issue as to representation, the judge then provided the accused with an adjournment to discuss how they wished to proceed. She identified as a further issue whether there was consent, based on legal advice, to the proposed judge-only trial. It is not necessary to set out the lengthy discussion which occurred in relation to these issues. However, the transcript records the judge saying to Mr El-Hilli: [6] 
	


“If you wish to be represented and make an application for a period of time for that to occur then I will deal with that application if you wish to make that, but I will not give leave to Ms Melville to legally represent you in these proceedings.”


	
	After further discussion the following exchange took place: [7] 
	


“HER HONOUR: … So, Mr El-Hilli, you either appear for yourself or I’ll give you a short time to obtain legal representation. How long – has this trial been listed before, Mr Crown?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: It has, your Honour. In August last year it was listed for trial and there was a Dietrich application. The trial was vacated pursuant to the indication that there was going to be an appeal against the refusal of Legal Aid. …

…

HER HONOUR: Surely, Mr El-Hilli – I mean I can explain to you as we go through the argument what the Crown is seeking to prove, what your grounds are to object. I can’t give you advice, I can’t make the decisions for you. But I have a responsibility to ensure that you can understand and follow the proceedings and that you are able to protect your interests and raise an objection where you should.

…

… So I will each allow yourselves to represent yourselves, I will allow you to adopt questions or submissions put on behalf of Ms Melville and to rely on her questions and submissions in your case. But she cannot act for you, she is your co-accused, she is not --

ACCUSED EL-HILLI: Okay, we’ll go that way.”


	
	These brief extracts demonstrate that the accused, the judge and the prosecutor were all fully apprised of the circumstances and the options available to both accused. They were expressly offered the opportunity to seek an adjournment to obtain legal representation if they wished. No doubt there were practical difficulties in the way of utilising that opportunity to good effect, but that is a separate question. In any event, the matter did not stop there. When the trial was later listed before North DCJ, he too inquired as to their representation and was advised that neither had a solicitor or barrister acting and that they had applied for legal aid and had been refused. [8]  Shortly before an adjournment, the following exchange took place:
	


“ACCUSED MELVILLE: Prior just to your Honour's leaving, previously we had an application before Judge Huggett. I have been representing Mr El Hilli up until now. Judge Huggett refused that application. Mr El Hilli was on remand for 14 months. I applied for bail and I was successful in that bail application. We previously had representation. The representation we didn't feel covered ourselves in the respects that what we were providing to the solicitors, that information wasn't being provided to the Courts.

Up until now I have done a very good job, but we'd like to make a further application to your Honour that I would represent both of us in these proceedings.”


	
	Having identified the procedural history with respect to representation, the prosecutor said that the matter was one for the judge, but noted also how it had been dealt with by Huggett DCJ. The judge then asked Ms Melville, first, what she wished to say on the question of representation. [9]  The question followed a discussion as to an issue to be raised with respect to tendency evidence relevant to the prosecution case against Mr El-Hilli. Ms Melville commenced:
	


“We understand the Crown's position in relation to the tendency argument, your Honour. Obviously that is a complex area of law that requires substantial understanding of certain elements of s 98, s 97, s 101 and particularly s 101(2), but more important is consideration of how that would affect a trial and interplay of that trial with a coaccused for allegations of fraud made in 2009. Obviously that is a substantial task for any barrister or lawyer to fight such a challenge, and to be self-represented would obviously be an additional challenge to that. We say in that argument that this has been a case that we've been working on for the last three years since notification has been provided or since our arrest in 2011.

We have worked on this case purely not because of a financial reasons, but purely for the fact that it has disrupted our family life and the fact that we obviously state that we are innocent of these charges. It is a very detailed case, as your Honour will find through the coming weeks, and I think to [sic] prejudicial Mr El Hilli to bring in a barrister at this stage as was discussed over the past coming days, would be detrimental because it would delay his proceedings in this trial. We know the case inside out, whether that's good or bad. He doesn't seem to think that it would be prejudicial to him in any way that I represent him. That would be of the Court's and of your Honour's decision as to whether I could represent, but we are strong in our standing that we have the ability to do it.”


	
	In the end, the judge adopted the same position as Judge Huggett: he refused leave to Ms Melville to represent her co-accused, but noted that she could play the lead role and there was no need for Mr El-Hilli to cover the same ground in cross-examination of witnesses, nor to repeat any submissions she might make, if he were happy to accept them.
	
	
	It is clear from this material that ground (1) is unarguable. Not only did Huggett DCJ expressly offer the accused an opportunity for an adjournment if they thought fit, but the question of representation was explored in detail on several days prior to the commencement of the trial, in a way which made it clear that no-one was in any doubt as to how the matter would proceed, nor as to the various options for proceeding in a different manner. Ground (1) must be rejected.
	


Tendency and coincidence evidence

(a)   the evidence


	
	The admissibility and use of the tendency and coincidence evidence informed the three major grounds of appeal, being grounds (2), (3) and (4). It is convenient to commence consideration of these grounds by identifying the evidence relied upon by the prosecution and its purpose in so doing.
	
	
	The prosecution sought to tender a statement of agreed facts concerning six charges under s 178BA of the Crimes Act committed between early 1999 and late 2000. Mr El-Hilli was committed for trial on six counts but, following negotiations, one count was withdrawn and three of the remaining five counts were dealt with on a Form 1, as matters to be taken into account in sentencing, following pleas of guilty in relation to the other two counts. Each offence involved an agreement by Mr El-Hilli to secure a loan of between $2 million and $10 million for the victims, based on assurances that the offender had access to substantial sums of Saudi Arabian money. In each case the loan was to be secured by an insurance policy with an agreed premium, ranging from $100,000 to $211,000. The premiums were paid to Mr El-Hilli, but no loans were forthcoming, nor were any insurance policies purchased. The moneys were diverted by the offender to his own purposes. At the time of that offending, Mr Issam El-Hilli called himself Sam Hill; the charges were brought against him in that name. The evidence relied upon by the prosecution in the present case included an agreed statement of facts and other material relevant to the guilty pleas, which resulted in Mr El-Hilli being convicted and sentenced in May 2003.
	
	
	There were, in substance, two issues which arose in dealing with this evidence at trial. The substantive question was how the evidence could properly be used. It was variously described as tendency, coincidence or “state of mind” evidence. On the appeal, the Director submitted that the prosecutor at trial had effectively abandoned reliance on “tendency reasoning”. [10]  The prosecution submission that it was “not really necessary to pursue tendency” was noted by the trial judge. [11]  Rather, the prosecutor relied upon the circumstances giving rise to the 2003 convictions as “direct evidence as to the accused’s state of mind” stating that it was “relevant because it could rationally affect the probability that the accused [in 2008]: (a) had an intention to deceive; (b) lacked any genuine belief that there is in fact money to lend; (c) knew that his conduct was likely to be regarded as dishonest.” [12] 
	
	
	Having so identified the prosecution case, the trial judge then warned himself that he should not rely upon guilt of other criminal acts as evidence that the accused was a person likely from his criminal conduct or character to have committed the offences charged. The judge also noted that the prosecution relied upon the earlier convictions as “coincidence evidence”. [13]  In accordance with s 98(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), it was therefore necessary to consider whether the evidence of the earlier convictions had “significant probative value.” The judge considered the similarity between the circumstances underlying the 2003 convictions and the allegations concerning the conduct underlying the charges before the Court. He identified the earlier evidence as establishing a “modus operandi”, noting “the overall similarities are marked.” [14]  The judge noted the prosecutor’s submission as providing a basis for two findings:
	


“…firstly, the accused, Mr El-Hilli did the other acts; and secondly, they are so similar to the acts giving rise to the two charges, that I find it is highly improbable both acts were committed by a different person. If I accept those two matters then I can use that evidence, together with the other evidence in the Crown’s case, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the accused, Mr El-Hilli, committed the acts giving rise to the two offences charged in the indictment.”


	
	Somewhat ambiguously, the judge then repeated his earlier warning to himself as to the way in which he could not use the earlier convictions and concluded:
	


“Having carefully considered the evidence and noting I have found Mr El-Hilli committed the 2003 acts, I am satisfied they are so similar that it is highly improbable they were committed by a different person.”


	
	The ambiguity arises because, despite the language of conclusion, this passage preceded a consideration of the evidence and may well have been a summary of the prosecutor’s submission, which started earlier on the same page. On the other hand, if it were to be taken as a finding of fact, it would illustrate a degree of confusion as to how the evidence of the earlier convictions was sought to be relied upon: there was no issue as to the offences being committed, but by some other person.
	
	
	The contingent exclusion of tendency evidence (s 97) and coincidence evidence (s 98) is governed by the purpose for which the evidence is sought to be used. [15]  In dealing with issues which may arise under ss 97 and 98 of the Evidence Act, it may be helpful to commence by identifying the basis on which the evidence is otherwise admissible, namely that it is “relevant” in the proceeding: s 56(1). To be relevant, the evidence, if accepted, must be capable of rationally affecting the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue: s 55(1). Section 55 assumes a process of inference, which may arise with respect to direct eyewitness testimony, but is particularly significant in relation to circumstantial evidence, and will always be relevant with respect to tendency and coincidence evidence.
	
	
	It is quite possible that evidence may bear upon the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in more ways than one: if, in one respect, the reasoning process may fall within either s 97 or s 98 (or both) then the conditions imposed by those provisions (and s 101) must be satisfied for the evidence to be admissible for that purpose. Nevertheless, the evidence may be admissible for an alternative purpose, not falling within those provisions, in which case it may be used for that purpose, but only for that purpose: s 95.
	
	
	The reference to the “2003 convictions”, used in submissions and, on occasion, by the trial judge, tended to obscure the precise relevance of the earlier conduct. It involved the following steps:
	



	
	Mr El-Hilli admitted to fraudulent conduct in 1999-2000;
	
	
	the 1999-2000 conduct demonstrated a modus operandi involving five separate courses of conduct;
	
	
	the elements of the two offences charged in the present indictment bore a striking similarity to the earlier conduct;
	
	
	it may be inferred that the conduct the subject of the present charges was also fraudulent.
	



	
	Broadly speaking, those elements may be reformulated in terms of the syllogistic reasoning identified in Elomar at [360] with respect to tendency evidence. However, at least in the present case, such a broad-brush approach fails to reveal (indeed tends to distract from) the more precise factual assessment which is required. Indeed, the elements set out above are also inadequate, taken by themselves. In order to carry out the function of determining in what way the evidence is relevant, it is necessary first to identify the issues in dispute. Of course, that cannot always be done with precision early in a trial, a circumstance recognised in s 57 of the Evidence Act dealing with “provisional relevance”. That problem does not arise in the present case, although it is an aspect of the procedural ground (ground (2)).
	
	
	The first critical fact in dispute in relation to Mr El-Hilli was whether he falsely represented himself as a man of substantial wealth, or at least having access to substantial amounts of money through a sheikh identified as Sheikh Khalid Ibn Al-Waleed. A second issue was whether Mr El-Hilli knew that such representations were false at the time they were made.
	
	
	The fact that Mr El-Hilli had been shown, on his own admission, to have made similar false representations in the past did not necessarily establish that, some years later, similar representations would necessarily be false. Circumstances may change. Nevertheless, the evidence was clearly relevant for this purpose. In addition, there was further evidence which suggested that circumstances had not changed.
	
	
	The prosecution needed to prove that Mr El-Hilli was not a man of wealth, nor a man who had access to capital from another source, between August and November 2008. The prosecution could establish that fact by evidence that (a) he had made false representations to that effect in 1999-2000; (b) shortly thereafter he was bankrupt, and (c) between 2003 and July 2008 he had been in prison. Each step in that reasoning was probative of the fact in issue (lack of significant financial resources) at the time of the conduct the subject of the indictment. In one sense, the earlier offending could be seen as evidence of a tendency to engage in a particular, unusual, course of conduct. However, the suggested purpose did not rely upon Mr El-Hilli having a tendency to act in a particular way nor to have a particular state of mind. Accordingly, the evidence did not constitute tendency evidence for the purpose of s 97. The prosecution was right to eschew tendency reasoning as part of its case.
	
	
	Further, the evidence as to the past events, although bearing similarity to the matters the subject of the indictment, was not used as coincidence reasoning: rather, it was relied upon to establish an objective state of affairs, namely lack of wealth and access to capital at the time the representations were made in 2008. It demonstrated that Mr El-Hilli had no significant wealth at an earlier point in time and no significant opportunity to acquire wealth in the meantime.
	
	
	The second element of the fraudulent conduct which was in dispute concerned Mr El-Hilli’s knowledge of these circumstances. Taken in isolation, it may have appeared improbable that Mr El-Hilli would enter into loan transactions involving tens of millions of euros with an upfront payment of significant sums in each case, if he had no capacity to provide the capital required. In that situation, the fact that he had conducted himself in a similar way in similar circumstances in the past provided a basis for inferring that he might do it again. That might be said to constitute “tendency” reasoning, based on the apparent propensity of Mr El-Hilli to act in that way.
	


(b)   ground 2 – procedural challenge


	
	Turning to the grounds of appeal in relation to this issue, the first complaint was that the ruling with respect to admissibility was not made prior to trial but only in handing down a final judgment. The applicants asserted that this caused them prejudice, on the basis that they were deprived of an opportunity to institute interlocutory appeals pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. Reliance was then placed upon the limited basis on which a ruling as to admissibility of evidence should be made, referring to the reasoning of this Court in R v Shamouil [16]  with relation to an application to exclude evidence on the basis of prejudice, pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The reasoning in Shamouil does not assist the applicants: when admissibility is determined by a judge conducting a jury trial it is sufficient for the judge to be satisfied that the evidence was capable of satisfying the statutory test. The applicants should, however, be in a stronger position on an appeal against conviction in seeking to establish that the higher hurdle, of actual compliance with the legislation, was not reached.
	
	
	The proposed right of interlocutory appeal also misstates the position under the Criminal Appeal Act. Thus, an appeal from an interlocutory judgment (otherwise than by the prosecution) requires leave. [17]  Further, it is well established that evidential rulings (at least those which do not determine the outcome of the trial) are not interlocutory judgments or orders within the meaning of s 5F: see, eg, R v Steffan. [18] 
	
	
	In these circumstances, the challenge to the procedural steps has not been made good. The course taken on the judge-alone trial was not shown to prejudice Mr El-Hilli.
	


(c)   ground 3 – probative value


	
	Mr El-Hilli’s ground (3) challenged the probative value of the 2003 convictions. For the reasons given above, the characterisation of the evidence as engaging coincidence reasoning was, at least in the way it was used as identifying the offender, erroneous; but it was also immaterial.
	
	
	To describe the evidence as relevant to his “state of mind” is not to deny that the process of reasoning with respect to the relevant inferences is tendency reasoning. Although the distinction between tendency and coincidence evidence is not clear-cut in all circumstances, the better view is that this case did not rely on coincidence or tendency reasoning.
	
	
	Although dealing with the issue in relation to s 98 of the Evidence Act (as coincidence evidence) the judge was satisfied that the evidence had significant probative value. Used in the manner explained above, there can be no doubt as to that conclusion. He also noted that the relevant notices had been served. The judge then found that the probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect, pursuant to s 101 of the Evidence Act. That finding was not directly challenged. In any event, the finding was almost beyond challenge. Prejudice, in this context, refers to the potential for misuse of the evidence. The judge recorded (and repeated) unchallenged warnings to himself as to how the evidence should not be used. There is no reason to conclude that the evidence was in fact misused.
	
	
	Ground (3) must be rejected. However, a degree of uncertainty as to the precise manner in which the evidence was used in the trial judge’s reasoning warrants a grant of leave to raise grounds (2) and (3).
	


Finding as to joint criminal enterprise (Melville, grounds 3 and 5)


	
	Grounds (3) and (5) raised by Ms Melville, and the submissions in support of them, were by no means easy to understand. They may be understood as alleging that the coincidence evidence admitted with respect to Mr El-Hilli was also used against Ms Melville, on the basis that a finding that Mr El-Hilli did not have substantial wealth, nor access to significant financial resources, formed a basis of the finding that Ms Melville knew that, or was reckless in that regard.
	
	
	For the reasons explained above, the reasoning required to support the conclusion that Mr El-Hilli did not have such resources available to him was not erroneous. The judge dealt with the manner in which Ms Melville had acted in relation to the prospective borrowers and in relation to the acquisition of the relevant up-front fees as providing sufficient grounds to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was a party to a joint criminal enterprise and had the relevant state of mind. Her state of mind was that she was at least reckless as to, if not aware of, the absence of available funds to provide the loans she purported to negotiate.
	
	
	It follows that there should be a grant of leave with respect to her grounds (3) and (5), but the appeal must be rejected.
	


Absence of complete contractual documentation (ground 5)


	
	The submissions in support of this ground related to the contractual arrangements with Ms Duncombe. These involved four documents. The first, Exhibit A, was a loan facility agreement between Victor Marsh Duncombe and Maria Diane Duncombe on the one part and Community Life Ltd on the other. A significant purpose of the agreement was to fund the application fee for the separate funding facility with Mr El-Hilli for the Duncombe development proposal. The second document was a loan contract for €5 million; the third document was a loan contract for €50 million. Fourthly, there was a letter signed by Ms Melville undertaking to repay the application fee should the loan amounts not be received by the borrowers. The objections taken to this material appear to have been threefold. First, originals of the two loan contracts had been lost by the police officer in charge of the investigation. Secondly, there were pages missing from both contracts and, thirdly, there had been non-disclosure of the full contracts with the prosecution brief.
	
	
	The ground did not assert that the copy documents were inadmissible, but rather that the trial miscarried because of the failure to provide mandatory pre-trial disclosure of the complete contracts and because incomplete contracts may have provided a misleading impression of the nature of the agreements.
	
	
	So far as the complaint of pre-trial disclosure is concerned, little turns on it as a separate issue. The obligation, pursuant to an order for pre-trial disclosure, is to produce documents in the possession of the prosecutor that are proposed to be tendered at trial: Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), ss 137(1) and 142. It was not disputed that the prosecutor did not have the original contracts to disclose: rather, there was a suggestion that he failed to make timely inquiry of the police as to the existence of the original documents. When inquiry was made, the documents were reported to have been lost. That statement was not challenged. The absence of the original documents was significant primarily because the copies were missing certain pages. The question of a miscarriage therefore depends upon the significance of the missing pages.
	
	
	Missing were page 20 in the €5 million loan contract and pages 9, 10 and 11 in the €50 million loan contract.
	
	
	Pages 19 and 21 in the larger loan contract were identical with the pages 19 and 21 in the smaller loan contract. These pages were to be found in a standard form deed of charge. The inference that page 20 was also identical in each was overwhelming. Nor was the missing page shown to have any particular relevance.
	
	
	Pages 9, 10 and 11, missing from the larger contract are part of a section headed “International, non-circumvention & non-disclosure”. The same section appears in the other contract. The only element which appears to be specific to the agreement is the insertion of the name of Mr El-Hilli and the period of the contract, being five calendar years. Each contract was with Mr El-Hilli and was for the period of five calendar years. In submissions before the trial judge, Ms Melville submitted that no inference of common terms could be drawn because pages 6 and 7 were “dramatically different”. [19]  However, those pages, which were undoubtedly different, were included with each contract. The differences resulted from the contracts involving different amounts and different banking instructions. In particular, with the smaller contract, the application fee was to be deposited into an account in the name of Ms Melville, with an amount for insurance being deposited into an account in the name of Mr El-Hilli, whereas in respect of the larger contract, there was no provision for an application fee payable to Ms Melville.
	
	
	Noting the objection taken to the tender of the documents, the trial judge outlined the basic terms of the agreements and the fact that the documents in evidence were only copies of the contracts and were incomplete. He continued: [20] 
	


“However, throughout the many days of the trial not one question was asked of any witness in regard to the contracts having any other possible meaning. It was accepted by both Duncombe and Kenway [that] they were to borrow €55 million and €18.5 million respectively. This was agreed by both accused. It was accepted by both accused that the upfront fees were to be $800,000 in the case of Mr Kenway and $200,000 in the case of Ms Duncombe. Both Kenway and Duncombe gave evidence of this. It was not put that any of the contracts did not [sic] provide for actual insurance monies to be paid out of the loan sum and not upfront. Consequently, it is not possible on the state of the evidence to give any weight to the objection the contracts were not originals. The clear case for both accused was that each borrower purported to borrow the agreed sum and Ms Melville agreed to accept the upfront fees.”


	
	The submission that the prosecution had suppressed evidence was not made good, nor was any miscarriage demonstrated to flow from the absence of either the original documents or the missing pages. Ground (5) must be rejected.
	


Prosecutorial misconduct (ground 4)


	
	Both applicants alleged there had been “prosecutorial misconduct”, which caused the trial to miscarry.
	
	
	The primary submission relied upon to support this ground involved cross-examination of Ms Melville by the prosecutor directed to having Ms Melville accept that any money provided by the sheikh might have involved “funnelling money from a terrorist into Australia”. [21]  Objection was taken to the line of questioning which ended with Mr El-Hilli saying, “You know, silly questions deserve silly answers, your Honour.” The trial judge put an end to the line of questioning by saying, “Anyway, let’s move on. It’s not particularly productive. Just let’s move on.” [22] 
	
	
	These remarks adequately summed up the exchange in cross-examination: the matter did not go anywhere. It certainly did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Mr El-Hilli submitted that this was but one of many instances in which he was “ridiculed, belittled and his evidence treated with disdain.” There are a number of available responses to this submission.
	
	
	First, the example occurred in the cross-examination of Ms Melville, not Mr El-Hilli. Secondly, while it is inappropriate for a prosecutor to ridicule or belittle the case of an accused, to convey that he or she is indicating a personal opinion, or otherwise seek to raise prejudice or emotion by intemperate or inflammatory comments, such conduct is less likely to result in a miscarriage of justice in a judge-alone trial. Thirdly, it is by no means clear that there was inappropriate conduct on the part of the prosecutor, of the kind described in the submissions. There is no doubt that the prosecutor set out to cast doubt on the evidence given by both of the accused. He was entitled to treat that evidence as potentially incredible, as, on its face, some of it was. The trial judge dealt with Mr El-Hilli’s evidence in the following terms: [23] 
	


“Mr El-Hilli was in the witness box for about seven days and was strenuously cross-examined by Mr Crown. …

The thrust of the cross-examination was that Mr El-Hilli’s version of his life and the events leading up to and following the two loan transactions were so fantastic and absurd as to be totally unbelievable.”


	
	It was clear in the reasoning which followed that the judge rejected key aspects of Mr El-Hilli’s evidence. He stated: [24] 
	


“I have come to the conclusion that Mr El-Hilli due to the extraordinary and untenable nature of his claims concerning massive wealth and his relationship with the Sheikh, is a witness who cannot be accepted in this regard.”


	
	In relation to Ms Melville, the submissions included references to her evidence in the prosecutor’s final address. It was the prosecution case, in dealing with her evidence, that her story was substantially or almost entirely false. [25]  The prosecutor characterised her evidence as presenting two inconsistent indeed “glaringly polar opposite sides of herself”. [26]  One was that she herself had significant wealth and high executive skills; the other was that she was a dupe of Mr El-Hilli and had been so foolish as to believe whatever he told her.
	
	
	A feature of the prosecution address with respect to Ms Melville’s evidence was that her claims depended entirely upon her own statements, without any supporting documentary record. There was no misconduct on the part of the prosecutor in treating parts of her evidence as a fabrication and presenting the prosecution case on that basis. The trial judge addressed Ms Melville’s evidence with some care, but ultimately concluded that, in critical respects, she had not told the truth. [27]  There was no improper conduct revealed by the prosecutor’s address in relation to Ms Melville. No miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated.
	


Miscellaneous (ground 6)


	
	The original grounds of appeal filed by Ms Melville on 28 May and by Mr El-Hilli on 1 June 2015 both included as the primary ground a claim that the verdicts against them were unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence. The submissions in support of those grounds did little more than summarise the subsequent more specific submissions. It was not said that the evidence admitted at trial was insufficient to support the convictions: nor could that reasonably have been suggested. That ground was not repeated in the grounds and submissions filed on 6 July 2015, although the final submission of each, stating that “erroneous rulings, directions and admissions” had cemented a miscarriage of justice and “obliterating her [in each case – sic] right to a fair trial”. However, the submissions referred to no specific error or errors but asserted that the Court “will set aside a conviction whenever it appears unjust or unsafe to allow the verdict to stand because some failure has occurred in observing the conditions which, in the Court’s view, are essential to a satisfactory trial”.
	
	
	The principle is, of course, undoubted: no relevant basis for its application was, however, demonstrated in the case of either Mr El-Hilli or Ms Melville.
	


Conclusion


	
	The manner in which the trial judge dealt with the question of tendency and coincidence evidence warranted a grant of leave to Mr El-Hilli to challenge his convictions on that basis. That included grounds (2) and (3) in his final submissions dated 6 July 2015. Leave should not extend to the other grounds relied upon in those submissions. The appeal against the convictions, limited to those grounds, must be dismissed.
	
	
	With respect to Ms Melville, the tendency and coincidence evidence was only relevant to her to the extent that she was involved in a joint criminal enterprise with Mr El-Hilli. She was not party to his earlier convictions. The mental element of her offending did not depend upon the tendency or coincidence evidence. However, to the extent that a ruling with relation to that material might have formed the basis for an application for separate trials, even though somewhat implausible in the circumstances, there should be a grant of leave with respect to that aspect of her grounds of appeal, being her grounds (3) and (5). Otherwise the grounds do not warrant a grant of leave to appeal against conviction. The appeal, so limited, should be dismissed.
	


Appeals against sentence

(a)   Issam El-Hilli


	
	Mr El-Hilli was convicted and sentenced for two counts under s 178BA of the Crimes Act. The provision was repealed in 2010 but, as in force at the date of the offending, it carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years. Mr El-Hilli was sentenced separately for each offence. He was sentenced first on count 2 as being the marginally less serious offence, because it involved the dishonest obtaining of a lesser amount of money. A sentence of three years imprisonment was imposed, with a non-parole period of two years and three months. The sentence was backdated by two years to take account of a period served by Mr El-Hilli in custody in England, together with further periods during which he was on bail, but subject to rigorous conditions. It commenced on 16 December 2012.
	
	
	For the second offence (count 1) a period of three years and four months imprisonment was imposed, with a non-parole period of two years and six months. That sentence was partly accumulated on the first, commencing one year and eight months after the commencement of the first sentence, namely on 16 August 2014. The cumulative non-parole period (four years and two months) will therefore expire on 15 February 2017. The cumulative overall sentence (five years) will run until 15 December 2017.
	
	
	Mr El-Hilli contends that each sentence is manifestly excessive, as is the degree of accumulation.
	
	
	With respect to the objective seriousness of the offending, the applicant relied upon the following statement, which he implied was agreed to by the prosecutor during the sentencing proceedings, namely that it was “certainly not at the upper end of any fraud, not even at the upper end when it comes to money, but below midrange. Not much below midrange however.” That proposition was in fact put by senior counsel appearing for Mr El-Hilli on sentence; [28]  it was not accepted by the prosecutor who submitted that “this is close to a worst case under the provision.” [29] 
	
	
	The assessment of the trial judge accorded more closely with that of the prosecutor. He recorded findings made in accordance with his judgment on liability that Mr El-Hilli “was clearly the person who planned and originated these false lending schemes”; that he “recruited the co-offender Ms Melville to act as a buffer between himself and the borrowers”; that if there were a sheikh, “there was no legitimate arrangement to lend vast sums of money” nor did Mr El-Hilli “have access to vast sums of money on his own account” and that Mr El-Hilli “began the planning of the crimes very shortly following his release from prison on the 2003 matters” and that he “deliberately set out give potential borrowers the illusion of great wealth and that this extended the renting of an inner-city unit.” He further concluded that both Ms Duncombe and Mr Kenway parted with their moneys on the basis that they would be repaid if the loan moneys were not forthcoming. The judge noted that the victims were duped, as were others associated with them, by a false façade which involved “quite detailed organisation and planning, including producing the loan documentation, false emails and hiring an appropriate inner-city apartment to convince victims of wealth.” He described the level of sophistication and planning as “quite significant” and said that it was “breathtaking in its audacity.” The judge concluded: [30] 
	


“I accept the Crown submission that although there are only two charges, each involved a multiplicity of dishonest acts by each offender. The offences took place over a number of months from approximately August 2008 until October/November 2008. Correspondence and delay continued into the next year. This is not an overly long period but constant conduct and thereby deception continued throughout.”


	
	The judge further found that the motive of both offenders was greed, describing their subsequent spending as “voracious” and “frankly mind-boggling.” Taking all these considerations into account, he concluded “that these are both crimes for both offenders of considerable seriousness.”
	
	
	Nothing was put by way of submissions in this Court to cast doubt upon this assessment.
	
	
	Mr El-Hilli’s subjective circumstances gave him no assistance. His date of birth was recorded in 1951; his criminal record commenced in 1974. After a number of counts of larceny and counts relating to false pretences, he graduated in 1982 to possessing a firearm and, in 1987, to armed robbery. The offences of obtaining money by deception, for which he was sentenced to imprisonment and released shortly prior to the present offending, were undertaken in 1999-2000. This was a record which both denied the applicant any benefit of leniency and which required weight to be given to “retribution, deterrence and protection of society”, as indicated by the sentencing judge. [31] 
	
	
	The written submissions suggested that his record had been treated as an aggravating circumstance, rather than being approached in the manner referred to above. That was not the case.
	
	
	The submissions also complained that the sentencing judge failed to consider reports tendered on his behalf and prepared by Dr Janelle Miller (psychiatrist) and Dr Stephen Woods (psychologist). That complaint was simply false: the judge gave careful consideration to both reports, extracting passages from each over four pages of his reasons. The submissions suggested that the judge should have accepted that he had reached a turning point in his life. However, the judge stated that “looking at his chances of rehabilitation and of not reoffending, I can only say that it is difficult to hold out much hope.” Noting that he was 63 years of age and was genuinely attached to both Ms Melville and to their daughter the judge said that this “might make him think a little about re-embarking on criminal schemes, but little weight can be attached to this.” [32] 
	
	
	The judge not only had the benefit of the diagnoses of each expert (to similar effect, namely that he did not suffer from a mental illness, but had a narcissistic personality disorder) the profile for which he described as fitting very much with his observations of Mr El-Hilli during the 31 day trial and the sentencing proceeding. [33]  It is not possible to doubt the accuracy of the findings, nor was any basis for doing so demonstrated.
	
	
	Finally, there was a complaint as to the level of accumulation of the sentences. In the course of submissions on sentence, senior counsel had suggested that “a substantial degree of concurrence is warranted in relation to the two offences but so is a significant degree of accumulation.” [34]  That was an entirely reasonable proposition, which was accepted and applied by the sentencing judge. It is doubtful if error could have been shown had there been a full accumulation, but that was not a step taken.
	
	
	It follows that Mr El-Hilli’s application for leave to appeal against sentence should be refused. There were no arguable grounds identifying error.
	


(b)   Jenny Samantha Melville


	
	Although sentenced as a co-offender in a joint criminal enterprise, Ms Melville received a markedly lower sentence than that imposed on Mr El-Hilli. The structure of her sentence conformed to that of Mr El-Hilli in that the first sentence imposed was in relation to count 2 and constituted a fixed term of nine months, to date from 16 December 2014 and expire on 15 September 2015. The sentence imposed on count 1 commenced on 16 March 2015 and comprised a non-parole period of 12 months (expiring 15 March 2016) with a balance of term of 12 months, expiring on 15 March 2017. The judgment made a finding of special circumstances, on the basis that it was a first sentence of imprisonment and that society would benefit from a longer period on parole, thus justifying an adjustment of the non-parole period, pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“Sentencing Procedure Act”). The judge directed her release at the end of the non-parole period, a course which he was required to take in imposing a sentence of three years or less. [35] 
	
	
	The objective circumstances surrounding the offending have been described above. Some circumstances related specifically to Mr El-Hilli, but some involved Ms Melville. Thus, it followed from the fact that Mr El-Hilli was the person who planned and organised the false lending schemes that Ms Melville was a less significant player. However dealing with her case, the judge found that “although recruited by Mr El-Hilli she quickly became central to the dealings with Mr Kenway and especially Ms Duncombe.” He also found that Ms Melville “knew that Mr El-Hilli had only recently been released from prison.” Further, she was “a party to the dissipation of a large amount of the moneys received from Mr Kenway and Ms Duncombe, which occurred in a very short time following receipt.” The judge found that when writing “delaying emails and making telephone calls with either Mr Kenway or Ms Duncombe she was aware that this was just to delay.” [36] 
	
	
	Ms Melville had subjective circumstances in her favour. She had no prior criminal convictions, was agreed to be of good character, and entitled to leniency in that regard. Ms Melville gave evidence on sentence, although only after the prosecutor had challenged the suggested common ground that her inability to find a person to look after her daughter would compromise her daughter’s well-being if she were sentenced to fulltime imprisonment. Although a pre-sentence report was favourable and assessed her risk of re-offending as “low”, the judge remarked that she would “need to stay clear of any schemes potentially hatched by Mr El-Hilli if she wishes to ensure that this assessment of low risk of offending is born[e] out.” [37] 
	


(i)   prejudgment


	
	Ms Melville put in significant written submissions on her appeal against sentence. The first complaint alleged that the trial judge had made up his mind in respect of a custodial sentence before the sentencing hearing. That, it was submitted, was revealed by comments when she had applied for bail on 15 July 2014 suggesting she should make arrangements for her daughter before the sentencing hearing took place. [38] 
	
	
	The remarks made by the judge at the bail hearing did not constitute an expression of pre-judgment: rather, they demonstrated realistic advice in circumstances where it was clear to the judge, if not to the offender, that a fulltime custodial sentence was a likely outcome. In fact the possibility of such an outcome was appreciated by Ms Melville who responded at one point, “I understand that there might be a custodial sentence.” [39] 
	


(ii)   backdating


	
	Secondly, Ms Melville alleged error in a failure to backdate her sentence to take account of a lengthy period of conditional liberty in the UK (18 months), while subject to a curfew, electronic monitoring and reporting conditions.
	
	
	Mr El-Hilli’s sentence was back-dated two years, primarily to take into account a period of approximately one year nine months of actual custody. Thus, a period of only some three months was allowed to take account of the period subject to strict controls in the UK (the actual period on bail being one year two months) and a further period on bail in Australia.
	
	
	There was discussion in the course of the sentence proceedings with respect to periods spent by Mr El-Hilli, both in custody and on remand. Senior counsel appearing for Mr El-Hilli proposed that account be taken of the “extra-curial punishment” involved in the periods both of pre-trial custody and being on remand under strict conditions. No similar submissions were made with respect to Ms Melville, although it would have been known to the sentencing judge that she had been arrested and granted bail in the UK and, following her extradition to Australia, in this country.
	
	
	These events can be accounted for in different ways. One, somewhat artificial, mechanism is to backdate the sentence even though the offender may not have been in custody at all during the period when the sentence was supposedly running. An alternative course is to simply reduce the sentence to take account of earlier custodial periods and periods under strict bail conditions. Where there is a period of actual custody of not insignificant length, backdating is treated as preferable, because it reveals the true extent of the sentence. Where allowance is made with respect to a period on remand under strict conditions, which is not directly equivalent to custody, a short reduction in sentence is an appropriate course to take.
	
	
	Having sentenced both offenders, the judge invited counsel to check the dates and asked whether there was anything which Ms Melville did not understand. Counsel indicated there was not. After Mr El-Hilli was sentenced, there were further exchanges between the Court and Mr El-Hilli after which counsel appearing for Ms Melville asked: [40] 
	


“JAMES: Your Honour with regards to Ms Melville could I ask did your Honour take into account the house arrest that she served prior to the matter.

HIS HONOUR: Yes I should put that on record, I did. I did take into account the period of house arrest.

JAMES: Your Honour the dates are fine in regards to Ms Melville.”


	
	There was no error in the course taken in this regard.
	


(iii)   effect of sentence on child


	
	Thirdly, Ms Melville submitted that the sentencing judge had failed to have proper regard to the effect of a sentence of fulltime imprisonment on her young child, then four years of age.
	
	
	In R v Edwards [41]  this Court (Gleeson CJ, James and Ireland JJ) allowed a prosecution appeal in circumstances where the offender had entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter with respect to the death of her partner and had received a sentence of three years to be served by way of periodic detention. The basis for the leniency was her ability to work effectively with a difficult and dangerous inmate of an institution for the intellectually and psychiatrically disabled. In short, lenience had been accorded because of the hardship which a sentence of fulltime imprisonment would have caused to a third party. As Gleeson CJ noted, “regrettably, causing hardship to third parties by the imprisonment of an offender is only too common.” [42]  The third parties who are the usual sufferers are the spouse and children of the offender. When compared with their situation, it was said that the concern for Ms Edwards' patient “cannot fairly be characterised as exceptional in degree.” The Chief Justice continued:
	


“Justice will not be seen to be administered even-handedly if exceptions are made in cases which are not truly exceptional.”


	
	Gleeson CJ also cited with approval the observations of Wells J in The Queen v Wirth [43]  including the principle that “hardship likely to be caused by a sentence of imprisonment under consideration ought to be taken into account where the circumstances are highly exceptional, where it would be, in effect, inhuman to refuse to do so.”
	
	
	Those principles were stated as applicable to sentencing under the general law. In R v Togias [44]  this Court considered a prosecution appeal in circumstances where the offender had been convicted of importing a commercial quantity of ecstasy, following a plea of guilty, but by the time of sentencing, a year later, had given birth to a baby who was three months old at the time of sentencing. The offence under federal law required the sentencing to be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 16A(2)(p) of which required that the court take into account “the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person’s family or dependants.” The general law approach was held to be applicable.
	
	
	Section 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, which identifies general considerations, aggravating factors and mitigating factors, does not deal with the possible effect of a custodial sentence on third parties. Nor is it properly described as “any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relatively seriousness of the offence.” [45]  On the other hand, the matters identified in s 21A(1) are said to be “in addition to any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under any Act or rule of law.” There is no reason to exclude the consequences for a third party, if they are truly or highly exceptional, in accordance with the general law principle.
	
	
	In Dipangkear v Regina [46]  Whealy J (Hodgson JA and Buddin J agreeing) stated that where the features of a particular case pointed to the need to impose a custodial sentence, but there was evidence of extreme hardship to a third party, a court may take one of three steps, namely (i) suspend the sentence of imprisonment, (ii) shorten the sentence, or (iii) decrease the non-parole period. The sentencing judge had in fact adopted both (ii) and (iii), despite finding that the hardship likely to be suffered by the offender’s wife and unborn child was not “highly exceptional”. [47]  Whealy J suggested that that approach might have been viewed as overly lenient.
	
	
	The present case was similar to Dipangkear. The judge, noting the strong bond between mother and daughter, and noting evidence that a sentence in excess of 12 months fulltime imprisonment could mean separation from her daughter and that there were “some real difficulties in placing” the daughter should fulltime imprisonment be deemed necessary, nevertheless did not accept that “any exceptional circumstances have been raised in regard to this particular matter.” That was an evaluative finding based on the primary facts identified, with which this Court could only interfere if error were demonstrated. Despite not finding exceptional circumstances, the judge did give consideration to the difficulty, concluding:
	


“No judge enjoys gaoling a mother. However, I will give her some leniency because of this sad situation and the fact that she is responsible on a day-to-day basis for a four year old girl, but I cannot ignore her role in these objectively serious offences and impose sentences that do not reflect this.”

The findings of the trial judge were thus in muted terms.


	
	In giving evidence on sentence, the applicant had been asked in turn about each member of her family and Mr El-Hilli’s family who might be able to care for their daughter if both parents were in custody. After giving evidence that she was “estranged” from her sisters, she was asked whether she was still close to her mother and said, “No, I don’t say that.” [48]  However, in the probation and parole report, which was tendered without objection, the account given to the Corrective Services officer was that she “maintains a supportive relationship with her mother”. When that was put to her in cross-examination, she said that that was “not what I said to Corrective Services.” [49] 
	
	
	Nevertheless, the applicant conceded that she had spoken to her mother about care for her daughter but said that her mother was “not in a position medically or physically to take my daughter which is very upsetting.” She continued:
	


“She is not in a financial position. She is on a single widow’s pension. She cannot look after my child.”


	
	Ms Melville was then cross-examined about the evidence given at her trial that she had “significant funds” located in the United Kingdom. She said that was true, but continued to maintain that her mother’s financial position was “a real concern”.
	
	
	Further, the uncontradicted evidence was that the daughter would be able to stay with her in prison until she reached school age. Although Ms Melville stated that “she needs to go to school at 5”, [50]  the school age in New South Wales is in fact six years.
	
	
	In supplementary submissions filed in this Court on 29 September 2015, she referred to the statement of the officer for the Director that the criminal justice visa under which her daughter had entered the country was cancelled on 21 November 2014. The letter continued:
	


“The cancellation of my daughter[’]s visa was undertaken prior to sentencing submissions, and such pertinent/critical information was withheld, from the Court + myself as parent of the child until 21 August 2015.”


	
	That complaint is not entirely consistent with her evidence on oath at the sentencing proceedings when she explained that her daughter was in Australia “on a criminal justice visa that expired.” On the other hand, a solicitor in the Director’s office wrote to her solicitor on 28 November 2014, shortly before the sentencing hearing, noting that the visa had not been “revoked”. (The solicitor also reaffirmed the undertaking to pay the child’s medical and dental costs, which was the subject matter of the concern at that stage.)
	
	
	The applicant’s daughter was apparently born on 25 November 2010, so that she would turn six in November 2016. On any view, the applicant mother will be entitled to release from custody in March 2016, four months after her daughter turns five years of age.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the applicant has not established a factual basis upon which to challenge the finding of the sentencing judge that no case of exceptional circumstances had been made out. The evidence does not establish the likelihood that mother and daughter will be separated before her release from custody.
	
	
	It may be that Ms Melville entertains a fear that her daughter will be removed to the United Kingdom, where she has no family, prior to her mother’s release from custody.
	
	
	Evidence with respect to the current status of the daughter’s visa was admitted by the Court following the hearing. The Solicitor for Public Prosecutions requested a further opportunity to provide “accurate information about what notification Ms Melville received from the original solicitor with carriage [of the matter].” This request was rejected, because it did not relate to a matter which arose on the appeal. What might have been relevant on the appeal, being evidence relevant to the sentence, but not available to the sentencing judge at the time of sentence, would be material demonstrating an intention on the part of officers in the Department of Immigration to remove her daughter from Australia prior to Ms Melville’s release from custody. There is presently no evidence before the Court of any such intention and accordingly it is not appropriate for this issue to be pursued further.
	
	
	The first call for relief in such a situation would, in any event, be a review of the decision of the Minister for Immigration, rather than a reopening of the sentencing judgment in this Court. However, against the unlikely possibility that steps were taken to remove the daughter prior to the mother’s release from custody on the present charges, and the further unlikely possibility that immediate relief is not otherwise available, this Court should grant leave to appeal but reserve its decision on the appeal for the limited purpose of considering further evidence on the issue if it arises, but otherwise ordering that the appeal will stand dismissed on 15 March 2016.

		23 November 2015",2015-11-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2768261,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Harris [2015] NSWLC 22,"Judgment


	
	An application for costs was made by the accused, Mr Harris, (the applicant) at the close of committal proceedings. The application for costs is opposed by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) (the respondent). The respondent raises a preliminary issue for determination, that the Local Court does not have jurisdiction to make the costs order sought. By agreement the hearing of the substantive application has been adjourned pending my determination on the jurisdictional issue.
	
	
	I am advised by the respondent that the same jurisdictional issue is before the District Court, at a sitting in December 2015. However, there is no indication that a decision will be made on the issue as at that date; the proceedings may be adjourned or the decision of the District Court may be reserved. Given the length of time the proceedings have been before the Local Court I decided to determine this matter.
	


Issue for determination


	
	Jurisdiction is challenged on the basis that s 116(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (the Act) only permits an order for costs “at the end of committal proceedings”. Section 117 provides further limitations on the award of costs. Section 3 defines committal proceedings as “a hearing before a Magistrate for the purpose of deciding whether a person charged with an indictable offence should be committed for trial or sentence”. The respondent argues that the present matter was only ever listed for mention, there was no hearing, and therefore no committal proceedings, and as such no jurisdiction for costs pursuant to s 116 of the Act.
	
	
	I am required to decide the following issues:
	



	
	What is the meaning of “committal proceedings” in the Act?
	
	
	What is the “end of committal proceedings”?
	
	
	What is the meaning of s 116 in the context of s 117 of the Act?
	


Background


	
	On 18 September 2014 the applicant was charged with two offences pursuant to section 66A(2), Crimes Act 1900 (Sexual Intercourse with Child Under 10 years by Person in Authority). Both offences (H56628841, sequences 1, 2) particularised the same complainant, being WW; the first offence date was 1/1/2011 - 1/7/2011, and the second offence date was 9/12/2013 – 18/7/2014.
	
	
	On 6 February 2015 the applicant was charged with a further two further offences pursuant to section 66A(2) (H56623725, sequences 1, 2); however, those offences related to a different complainant, being YY. The offence dates, for both those matters, were 4/7/2013 – 10/7/2014.
	
	
	The procedural history of each set of matters is as follows. The first two charges, in respect of complainant WW, were first listed on 8 October 2014 when orders were made for the service of the brief by 19 November and reply by 10 December 2014. The matter was listed, on behalf of the accused, for an application to review bail on 15 October, which was finalised on 12 November 2014 when bail was varied. The DPP first appeared in the matter on 15 October 2014. On 10 December 2014 the matters were listed for reply to the brief but were adjourned to 11 February 2015 for the balance of the brief to be served. The court was advised on 11 February that the brief had been served but further time was sought by the accused for reply and the matter was adjourned to 18 March 2015.
	
	
	The matters involving complainant YY were first listed on 6 February 2015 when a release application was made, the applicant having been refused bail by the police. Bail was refused and the matter adjourned to 11 February 2015 to be listed on the same date as the charges involving the complainant WW. Thereafter both matters were listed on the same dates. On 11 February 2015 brief service orders were made for the new matters, which were adjourned for reply on 18 March 2015. The applicant was bail refused for the second set of charges from 6 February 2015 to 20 April 2015, when bail was granted by the Supreme Court.
	
	
	From March 2015 both sets of matters remained listed together on various mention dates. Adjournments were sought so that representations made by the accused could be considered by the prosecution. On 5 August 2015 the court was advised that a review by a Senior Crown Prosecutor was in progress. The matters were briefly further adjourned, and on 19 August 2015 all charges were withdrawn.
	
	
	On 19 August 2015 the applicant applied for costs. The costs application was adjourned for the filing of written submissions and was listed for hearing on 6 November 2015. On that date it was agreed that the jurisdictional issue should be determined before hearing the substantive costs application. On 6 November 2015 I reserved, adjourning the matter to 24 November 2015 for decision.
	


DPP submissions challenging jurisdiction


	
	The respondent provided written and oral submissions to the effect that there was no jurisdiction to award costs pursuant to s 116 of the Act as there were no “committal proceedings” as defined in that Act. It is argued that while there were a number of mention dates, there had been no hearing before a Magistrate for the purpose of deciding whether a person charged with an indictable offence should be committed for trial. Reliance was placed on the definition of committal proceedings in s 3 of the Act.
	
	
	It was argued in terms of statutory interpretation that sections 116 and 117 of the Act set up a regime where only very limited circumstances can justify an award of costs in committal proceedings. The respondent concedes that the charges were withdrawn, but the respondent submits there had never been committal proceedings because there had been no hearing before a Magistrate for the purpose of deciding whether a person charged with an indictable offence should be committed for trial or sentence.
	
	
	The respondent acknowledges that the word “hearing” is not defined in the Act, but submits that the “hearing” must be when the Magistrate is considering the question of whether to commit for trial, either through paper committal or through the calling of oral evidence on committal. The respondent notes that it may be argued by the applicant that the filing of a Court Attendance Notice is the commencement of committal proceedings, but the respondent submits that the committal “hearing” does not commence with the filing of the Court Attendance Notice (CAN).
	
	
	Reference is made to sections 47 and 53 of the Act which provide for commencement of committal proceedings. However, it is submitted that it does not follow that any date, from the date of the filing of the CAN, upon which the proceeding is before the Local Court, is “a hearing before a Magistrate to the purpose of deciding whether a person charged with an indictable offence should be committed for trial or sentence”. It is submitted that every court date following the filing of the CAN cannot be said to be “committal proceedings” within the definition provided by section 3 of the Act.
	
	
	The respondent notes support for a contrary position may arise from consideration of sections 54 and 60 of the Act, however submits that for full meaning to be given to the term “committal proceedings” within the meaning of the Act, the court date must be a “hearing before a Magistrate for the purpose of deciding whether a person charged with an indictable offence should be committed for trial or sentence” and if the relevant court date is not such an occasion, for example, a mention date, it does not fall within the definition of committal proceeding. Reliance is also placed on the definition of committal proceedings in the former Justices Act 1902:
	


Committal proceedings means a hearing before a Justice or Justices to the purpose of deciding whether a person charged with an offence should be committed for trial or sentence, and includes any proceedings that are preliminary thereto, or ancillary thereto.


	
	The respondent submits that the current definition which removes the words “includes any proceedings that are preliminary thereto or ancillary thereto” appears a deliberate decision to limit the definition of what amounts to a committal proceeding, which then has the capacity to impact on when costs can be awarded. It is submitted that it is relevant that the focus of the inquiry is “at the end” of committal proceedings, not during the process, and it is argued that what occurred in the current case was during the process, rather than at the end, of committal proceedings.
	
	
	The respondent submits that further support for the argument can be found in the provisions governing the commencement of summary proceedings and when costs may be awarded. It is noted the provisions are similar to those governing indictable charges and costs in committal proceedings. It is submitted that the term “summary proceedings” is not defined by section 3, or elsewhere in the Act, and therefore the inclusion of the definition of “committal proceedings” was deliberate, indicating that the words of the definition must be applied by the court. The express exclusion or inclusion of certain words and definitions in legislation must be viewed as a conscious choice by the legislature rather than mere chance. The respondent submits that the change in wording, from the previous definition in the Justices Act, was done with the intention to limit the circumstances in which costs could be awarded by the Local Court in proceedings for indictable charges. The respondent submits there is no ambiguity in the words of the section and the purpose of sections 116 and 117 was to significantly limit those situations where costs could be awarded. The respondent submits that consistent with that approach, section 116 should be limited to those circumstances where the Magistrate is engaged in the question of whether an indictable offence should be committed for trial, and that this has not occurred in the current matter.
	


Submissions by the applicant


	
	Mr Walsh, legal representative for the applicant, made detailed oral submissions. The applicant submits that it would defeat the purpose of the costs provisions in the Act for the court to adopt the interpretation urged by the respondent.
	
	
	The applicant noted that the respondent’s submission that section 116 only applies in very limited circumstances where the committal proceedings are by way of a contested committal hearing. The applicant submits that must be rejected as being a restriction not intended by the legislation. The words “end of proceedings” means a conclusion of proceedings with finality; and committal proceedings commenced by a CAN may end in a variety of ways. A Magistrate may decide to commit for trial; alternatively a Magistrate may decide, pursuant to ss 62/64/66 of the Act, to discharge the defendant; and proceedings may also end where those proceedings are aborted (for example, where a Magistrate needs to disqualify him or herself). Just as there are various ways a committal proceeding may end, there are various ways a committal can proceed: there may be a contested committal hearing with witnesses in attendance; there may be a paper committal/ hand-up brief; or there may be a committal waiver.
	
	
	The applicant submits that the Magistrate’s jurisdiction for costs arises at the end of the proceedings: it is the end of proceedings which triggers the s 116 application for costs. The applicant submits that if the respondent’s interpretation is correct, the Local Court would only have power to award costs, upon withdrawal of the charges, after contested proceedings, and that having regard to the whole of the legislation, the purpose of the section, and the nature of committal proceedings, this cannot be right.
	
	
	The applicant agreed that the intention of the legislation is to limit the circumstances in which costs can be awarded, but submits that what is being advanced in the present case is a further limitation not intended by the legislation.
	
	
	The applicant also relied on principles of statutory interpretation, as set out in the decision of the High Court of Australia, Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28.
	
	
	At the hearing on 6 November 2015 the applicant relied on oral submissions and I reserved the decision. Additional written submissions by the applicant, dated 19 November, were received by me on 20 November after I had prepared this written judgment. It is noted these were provided without leave of the court, after completion of the hearing. Given the jurisdictional argument was not anticipated by the applicant, and the applicant had prior to the scheduled hearing filed detailed written submissions addressing the substantive costs application, no criticism of the applicant is made. Given receipt of the written submissions after I had prepared this written judgment, I have not detailed the content of the written submissions in this judgment. I have considered the submissions, and the further authorities referred to. However, having regard to the findings I have made, I have not further engaged with the written submissions made by the applicant.
	


The authorities – discussion


	
	In oral submissions the applicant relied upon a decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, per Justice Simpson: Hanna v Horler [1999] NSWSC 1159 (Hanna v Horler). The decision involved a challenge to a decision of the Magistrate in relation to costs under the former provisions of section 41A of the Justices Act 1902. In summary the facts of the matter are that committal proceedings came before two Magistrates. The first Magistrate before whom the proceedings commenced made an order disqualifying himself from further hearing the proceedings, and so did not complete the committal proceedings. Committal proceedings were commenced in front of a second Magistrate who heard the matter to finality- the hearing included evidence in the defence case and submissions made over a further period of five days. The second Magistrate, Ms Horler, ordered that the defendant be discharged pursuant to section 41(6). Costs were sought by the defendant and the Magistrate declined to make an order in relation to the committal proceedings which had taken place before the first Magistrate finding that she lacked jurisdiction to make an order in relation to the costs of the previous committal. Justice Simpson after considering various arguments advanced by the parties found as follows:
	


16 In my opinion the answer to this question lies in a simple analysis of s 41A(1). That section provides for an award of costs following an order discharging a defendant ""as to the information then under inquiry"". The magistrate is empowered to order the payment of ""such costs as … seem just and reasonable"". In my opinion there is nothing in that section which deprives the magistrate of the power to award costs which include the costs of an aborted hearing. They are the costs relevant to the prosecution of the information on which the defendants have been discharged.

17 Such a construction has the advantage of being consonant with notions of ordinary justice. If the position adopted by the DPP were correct, the plaintiffs, no matter how deserving, would be disentitled to any costs orders in relation to the proceedings before Mr Kearney, because the power to award costs can only be exercised by a justice ""when making an order discharging a defendant…"" (or, pursuant to sub para (b), when committing a defendant for trial…""). That is, the order for costs can only be made on the completion of the committal proceedings. Since, by reason of Hulme J's order, Mr Kearney was precluded from completing the committal proceedings, he was disempowered in relation to costs. To hold that defendants in those circumstances had no avenue of recovering costs would lead to an unjust verdict.


	
	The applicant states that similarly, in the present matter, the position of the DPP would disentitle a defendant to costs in many committal matters, often held over some months duration prior to the committal hearing, from being entitled to costs orders in relation to the proceedings, no matter how deserving. The applicant submits that to hold that such defendants in appropriate cases had no avenue of recovering costs would be similarly unjust.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that Hanna v Horler is not of assistance in determining the present matter as it involved an award of costs after committal proceedings, being a hearing before a Magistrate for the purpose of determining whether to commit an accused person for trial. The respondent submits the case has no application in the current matter because the current matter involves withdrawal of proceedings prior to committal proceedings, being prior to the hearing, so that there is no jurisdiction for costs.
	
	
	I consider that the case of Hanna v Horler involved an award of costs after an order discharging the defendant after completion of committal proceedings. Relevantly, the applicable costs provision, in s 41A of the Justices Act, specifically provided for the jurisdiction to award costs under subsection (1)(a) “when making an order discharging a defendant as to the information then under inquiry”. The decision in Hanna v Horler is based on this provision- the jurisdiction for the costs order flowed from the Magistrate’s order for discharge of the defendant as to the information then under inquiry. These words are not retained in s 116 of the current Act, which states that a Magistrate may award costs at the end of committal proceedings if the accused is discharged or the matter withdrawn.
	
	
	In determining the meaning of committal proceedings and in particular the definition in section 3 of the Act, the applicant submits that regard must be had to the purpose of legislation in addition to a literal construction of the words. The applicant refers the decision of the High Court of Australia, Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28. That decision involved quite different factual concerns. However, what is relied upon by the applicant is the general statements made by the High Court as to principles of statutory construction, particularly in the context of conflicting or competing statutory provisions. The High Court stated (footnotes omitted):
	


69 The primary object of statutory construction is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute. The meaning of the provision must be determined “by reference to the language of the instrument viewed as a whole”. In Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Agalianos, Dixon CJ pointed out that “the context, the general purpose and policy of a provision and its consistency and fairness are surer guides to its meaning than the logic with which it is constructed”. Thus, the process of construction must always begin by examining the context of the provision that is being construed.

70 A legislative instrument must be construed on the prima facie basis that its provisions are intended to give effect to harmonious goals. Where conflict appears to arise from the language of particular provisions, the conflict must be alleviated, so far as possible, by adjusting the meaning of the competing provisions to achieve that result which will best give effect to the purpose and language of those provisions while maintaining the unity of all the statutory provisions. Reconciling conflicting provisions will often require the court “to determine which is the leading provision and which the subordinate provision, and which must give way to the other”. Only by determining the hierarchy of the provisions will it be possible in many cases to give each provision the meaning which best gives effect to its purpose and language while maintaining the unity of the statutory scheme.

71 Furthermore, a court construing a statutory provision must strive to give meaning to every word of the provision. In The Commonwealth v Baume Griffith CJ cited R v Berchet to support the proposition that it was “a known rule in the interpretation of Statutes that such a sense is to be made upon the whole as that no clause, sentence, or word shall prove superfluous, void, or insignificant, if by any other construction they may all be made useful and pertinent”…

…

78 However, the duty of a court is to give the words of a statutory provision the meaning that the legislature is taken to have intended them to have. Ordinarily, that meaning (the legal meaning) will correspond with the grammatical meaning of the provision. But not always. The context of the words, the consequences of a literal or grammatical construction, the purpose of the statute or the canons of construction may require the words of a legislative provision to be read in a way that does not correspond with the literal or grammatical meaning. In Statutory Interpretation, Mr Francis Bennion points out:

""The distinction between literal and legal meaning lies at the heart of the problem of statutory interpretation. An enactment consists of a verbal formula. Unless defectively worded, this has a grammatical meaning in itself. The unwary reader of this formula (particularly if not a lawyer) may mistakenly conclude that the grammatical meaning is all that is of concern. If that were right, there would be little need for books on statutory interpretation. Indeed, so far as concerns law embodied in statute, there would scarcely be a need for law books of any kind. Unhappily this state of being able to rely on grammatical meaning does not prevail in the realm of statute law; nor is it likely to. In some cases the grammatical meaning, when applied to the facts of the instant case, is ambiguous. Furthermore there needs to be brought to the grammatical meaning of an enactment due consideration of the relevant matters drawn from the context (using that term in its widest sense). Consideration of the enactment in its context may raise factors that pull in different ways. For example the desirability of applying the clear literal meaning may conflict with the fact that this does not remedy the mischief that Parliament intended to deal with.""

Discussion and Findings


	
	To determine the jurisdictional argument, it is necessary to construe the provisions of section 3 and section 116 of the Act, and in doing so I have had regard to the authorities detailed above. I am required to consider the words of sections 3 and 116, having regard to the language of the Act as a whole, and its purpose, with consideration of the context of the provisions.
	
	
	The section 3 definition provides:
	


(1) In this Act, except in so far as the context or subject-matter otherwise indicates or requires:

…

committal proceedings means a hearing before a Magistrate for the purpose of deciding whether a person charged with an indictable offence should be committed for trial or sentence.


	
	Section 116 (1)(a) states:
	


116 When costs may be awarded to accused persons 

(1) A Magistrate may at the end of committal proceedings order that the prosecutor pay professional costs to the registrar, for payment to the accused person, if:

(a) the accused person is discharged as to the subject-matter of the offence or the matter is withdrawn, or …

What is the meaning of “committal proceedings” in the Act?


	
	The Act makes several references to “committal proceedings” in various provisions. It is clear from the definition in section 3 of the Act that “committal proceedings” are defined as “a hearing before a Magistrate for the purpose of deciding whether a person charged with an indictable offence should be committed for trial or sentence” (my italics). The words in the definition provide for a hearing, for the purpose of a particular decision. The literal meaning of the words in the section 3 definition, without consideration of the Act as a whole, do restrict those proceedings to a hearing for the stated purpose of deciding whether to commit for trial or sentence. One must however read the definition with regard to all of the words in s 3: subsection (1) states, “In this Act, except in so far as the context or subject-matter otherwise indicates or requires … ‘committal proceedings’ means…”. This indicates that the definition should be considered in context and with regard to subject matter.
	
	
	Some reliance was placed in the respondent’s submissions on the definition previously contained in the Justices Act 1902:
	


committal proceedings means a hearing before a Justice or Justices to the purpose of deciding whether a person charged with an offence should be committed for trial or sentence, and includes any proceedings that are preliminary thereto or ancillary thereto.


	
	It was suggested that the removal of the words “and includes any proceedings that are preliminary thereto or ancillary thereto” indicated an intention to restrict the meaning of committal proceedings to the hearing. However, a definition of committal proceedings was contained in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 prior to the repeal of the Justices Act, and with the repeal of the Justices Act and the insertion of the provisions relating to committals in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the existing definition in the Criminal Procedure Act was retained largely unamended. By the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Justices and Local Court Act) 2001 No 119 (the 2001 amending Act), the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 was amended to contain the provisions relating to committal proceedings. The 2001 amending Act provided that the provisions were to commence on a date to be proclaimed, and the majority of the provisions commenced in 2003. (Historical notes indicate the date of commencement of Sch 1 [17] was 19 April 2002 (s 2 and GG No 72 of 12/4/2002, p 2200); the date of commencement of the remainder was 7 July 2003 (s 2 and GG No 104 of 27/6/2003, p 5976).
	
	
	Prior to the insertion of the committal provisions into the Act by the 2001 amending Act, the definition of committal proceedings was:
	


committal proceedings means a hearing before a Magistrate (or one or more Justices) for the purpose of deciding whether a person charged with an indictable offence should be committed for trial or sentence.


	
	The 2001 amending Act merely removed the reference to “one or more Justices” from the existing definition in the Act.
	
	
	Nothing appears to turn on the removal of the words “includes any proceedings that are preliminary thereto or ancillary thereto” which previously existed in the Justices Act 1902, given the existing definition of committal proceedings which was contained in the Criminal Procedure Act, prior to the repeal of the Justices Act (by the Justices Legislation Repeal and Amendment Act 2001 No 121). Further, when procedural provisions for committal proceedings were placed in the Criminal Procedure Act by the 2001 amending Act, the definition of committal proceedings which previously existed in the Act remained largely unchanged. The Second Reading Speech of 4 December 2001 does not assist as it does not comment on this change; the main focus of the Second Reading Speech was the intention of Parliament to simplify procedural laws and locate the procedural provisions relating to criminal proceedings in one Act.
	
	
	In determining the jurisdictional issue I must also be satisfied as to the meaning of “end of committal proceedings” as used in section 116 of the Act. It is therefore important to consider the meaning of “committal proceedings” in the Act as a whole, to understand the intended meaning of the words in section 116.
	
	
	The term “committal proceedings” is used throughout the Act. Indeed the provisions relating to committals are contained in Chapter 3, Part 2 of the Act which is entitled “Committal Proceedings” and contains the procedural provisions governing committal proceedings. Part 2 contains Divisions 1 to 7, which are, for example, entitled “Commencement of Proceedings” (Division 1), “Committal Proceedings Generally” (Division 2), “Prosecution Evidence” (Division 3), “Defence Evidence” (Division 4), “Procedure if Accused Pleads Guilty” (Division 5), “Costs” (Division 7).
	
	
	The Act provides for the commencement of committal proceedings by way of court attendance notice (CAN) (s 47), and s 53 provides that all proceedings are taken to have commenced on the date on which a CAN is filed. The clear words of those provisions indicate that the committal proceedings have commenced (and are therefore on foot) once the CAN has issued and been filed. They do not end until the accused is discharged by the Magistrate, or the proceedings are withdrawn by the prosecution, or until the Magistrate decides to commit an accused for trial or sentence.
	
	
	Section 55 of the Act states that the Magistrate is to conduct committal proceedings, and determine the proceedings. The Act sets up a procedural scheme for the conduct of the committal, including that the Magistrate set a time for the taking of prosecution evidence, the serving of such evidence on the accused person, and for the accused to serve a notice in reply (ss 60, 61):
	


60 Time for taking prosecution evidence 

(1)   On the first return date for a court attendance notice in any committal proceedings, or at such later time or times as the Magistrate determines, the Magistrate must set:

(a) the date, time and place for taking the prosecution evidence and the time within which written statements, and copies of any proposed exhibits identified in the statements (or a notice relating to inspection of them), must be served on the accused person, and

(b) the time within which the accused person must serve on the prosecutor any notice requesting the attendance of a person who made a written statement.

Note. Prosecution evidence is to be given by written statements (see Division 3), which includes a reference to a recorded statement in the case of a domestic violence offence (see section 76A (5)).

(2) The registrar must notify the accused person of the date, time and place, and any other time set by the Magistrate, if the accused person is not present.

(3) A registrar may exercise the Magistrate’s functions under this section.

61 Discharge of accused person if prosecutor not present for taking of evidence 

(1)   If the prosecutor fails to appear on the day and at the time and place set for taking prosecution evidence in any committal proceedings, the Magistrate must:

(a) discharge the accused person as to the offence the subject of the proceedings, or

(b) if the Magistrate thinks it appropriate, adjourn the hearing to a specified time and place.

(2) The adjournment must not exceed 8 days or such longer period as the accused person may consent to.

(3) Subsection (2) does not apply if the accused person is refused bail and section 41 of the Bail Act 2013 (which provides for a maximum adjournment period) applies.


	
	Relevantly, s 60 refers to the “first return date for a court attendance notice in any committal proceedings” which is clearly not a reference to a date that the matter is for hearing. Section 61 provides that if the prosecutor fails to appear on the date and time set pursuant to section 60, the Magistrate must alternatively discharge the accused person the subject of the proceedings, or adjourn the proceedings. Section 61 thereby specifically provides for the end of proceedings if there is not compliance with section 60, or non-appearance by the prosecutor, by discharging the accused. The proceedings which may be ended by discharge of the accused under section 61 are by necessary implication the committal proceedings. Those proceedings would come to an end due to an order for discharge made by a Magistrate under s 61, and would occur without a decision being made by the Magistrate whether to commit for trial, as a discharge under s 61 would not require a hearing of prosecution evidence, nor require a decision by a Magistrate after the taking of prosecution evidence.
	
	
	Section 58 refers to “hearing” but only in the context of change of venue. It is clear that the reference to committal proceedings, and transfer of those proceedings, refers to the proceedings prior to the contested committal hearing:
	


58 Place of hearing 

(1)    A Magistrate may transfer committal proceedings to another Magistrate in another place, if satisfied that:

(a) the principal witnesses to prove the offence live in another place where the offence is alleged to have been committed, or

(b) for any other reason, it is in the interests of justice to do so.

(2) The Magistrate may, subject to the Bail Act 2013, make orders necessary to enable the accused person to be brought before the other Magistrate and to be dealt with according to law


	
	Procedural provisions of the Act also allow for waiver of committal; in such circumstances there is no committal hearing but the Magistrate may still make an order committing for trial (s 68).
	
	
	Section 54(1) refers to “first attend before a Magistrate for the hearing of committal proceedings”, and states:
	


A person who issues a court attendance notice may, at any time after the notice is issued and before the date on which the accused person is required to first attend before a Magistrate for the hearing of committal proceedings, apply for a warrant to arrest the accused person.


	
	The references to “first attend” and “for the hearing of committal proceedings” as used in s 54, refer to a part of the procedure well before any hearing date for contested committal proceedings.
	
	
	After considering the Act as a whole, and the references to committal proceedings in ss 47, 53, 54, 60, 61 as set out above, I find that the term “committal proceedings” is not restricted to the hearing date, but includes the proceedings from the issue/filing of the CAN until the end of the proceedings. This interpretation gives a consistent meaning to the language of the Act as a whole.
	
	
	There is some support for this construction when one considers similar provisions in the Act dealing with summary proceedings. The case of Hammond v DPP [2013] NSWSC 888 considered the meaning of “first return date” and “hearing date” in the context of a Magistrate’s determination of a matter in the absence of a defendant under s 196 of the Act. The court considered competing arguments advanced as to the applicable meaning of various provisions of the Act, and noted that there was a requirement to provide reasonable notice of hearing dates and/or first return dates. An argument presented was that the court could not determine a matter pursuant to section 196 of the Act, in the absence of a defendant, where it was not the first return date or a scheduled hearing date, but was a mention date to which the proceedings had been adjourned. The court noted:
	


… to the extent that the legislature has clearly expressed an intention to streamline summary procedures in circumstances where an accused person has been served with court attendance notice and notice of the date upon which he/she is to attend court, yet does not attend, there is in my view, no denial of procedural fairness. …. The power in section 190(3) is not constrained by the fact that the matter was listed for mention, although that may be a factor that bears upon the exercise of the discretion to proceed to hearing.


	
	This reasoning can be applied to the provisions relating to committal proceedings in the Act- the Act intends to set out clear procedures for committal proceedings. Similarly to the provisions governing summary matters, the provisions applicable to committal proceedings in the Act refer to a first return date and to the setting of a further date for the taking of prosecution evidence (s 60).
	
	
	Further, s 54(3A) provides for the issue of a warrant if the accused absconds from the committal proceedings:
	


If an accused person is not present at the day, time and place set down for the hearing of committal proceedings (including any day to which proceedings are adjourned), or absconds from the committal proceedings, the Magistrate may issue a warrant to arrest the accused person if the Magistrate is satisfied there are substantial reasons to do so and that it is in the interests of justice to do so.


	
	Relevantly s 54(3A) distinguishes between “the hearing of committal proceedings” and absconding “from the committal proceedings” which would indicate that committal proceedings cannot be limited to the hearing date. Section 54(3A) provides that if the accused is not present for the day set down for the hearing of committal proceedings, including any day to which the proceedings are adjourned, or absconds from the committal proceedings, a warrant may be issued. It cannot be maintained that the ability to issue a warrant only applies to the contested hearing date, in considering what is meant by absconding from “committal proceedings”. It must also extend to any date which the committal proceeding is listed before the court, including the dates set under s 60, and mention dates.
	
	
	Having regard to all of the provisions of the Act referred to above, and for the reasons already detailed, I find that mention dates must form part of “committal proceedings”, and committal proceedings include the proceedings from the filing of the CAN until the end of the proceedings.
	


What is the ""end of committal proceedings""?


	
	Section 116 provides for jurisdiction, for costs orders, at the end of committal proceedings. Committal proceedings may end, as referred to above, by an order discharging the defendant pursuant to section 61 of the Act, and this may occur on the date for the taking of prosecution evidence on non-appearance by the prosecutor. A committal proceeding may also end upon a determination being made by a Magistrate, after a committal hearing, pursuant to section 62 or sections 64/65/66 of the Act, whether such hearing proceeds by way of a hand up brief or after evidence from witnesses.
	
	
	Committal proceedings may also end on a date when the matter is listed for mention and a plea of guilty is entered, facts are tendered to the Magistrate, and after consideration of the facts, the Magistrate decides to accept the guilty plea and commit the accused person for sentence.
	
	
	Further, it is useful in understanding the meaning of “end of committal proceedings” to consider the words of section. Relevantly s 116(1)(a) states:
	


(1) A Magistrate may at the end of committal proceedings order that the prosecutor pay professional costs to the registrar, for payment to the accused person, if

(a) the accused person is discharged as to the subject-matter of the offence or the matter is withdrawn…


	
	The jurisdiction for costs, where a matter is withdrawn, is included in the same subsection as for where an accused is discharged (s 116(1)(a)). An accused will ordinarily be discharged after a committal hearing, however a matter can be withdrawn at any time after it is commenced. The inclusion of both these quite different ways that committal proceedings may end, in the one subsection, in my view militates against the argument that the legislature intended “end of committal proceedings” in s 116, to mean after a committal hearing. An order is made for discharge of an accused in committal proceedings, by a Magistrate, pursuant to s 62 or s 66, if the Magistrate makes certain determinations under each of those sections. However, a matter which is withdrawn by the prosecution is not subject to any determination by the Magistrate; upon withdrawal the order made is “withdrawn and dismissed”. By including in s 116(1)(a) both circumstances- where an accused is discharged or where the matter is withdrawn- the legislature has included in the same subparagraph a matter requiring a determination by the Magistrate (discharge) and a matter not requiring any determination (matter withdrawn). This indicates the legislature did not intend that “end of committal proceedings” in s 116 be restricted to the end of proceedings after a hearing for the purpose of decision by the Magistrate.
	


What is the meaning of s 116 in the context of s 117?


	
	Section 116 provides for when costs may be awarded, and section 117 provides for restrictions on the award of costs against a public officer. Section 117 states:
	


117 Limit on circumstances when costs may be awarded against a public officer 

(1)   Professional costs are not to be awarded in favour of an accused person in any committal proceedings unless the Magistrate is satisfied as to any one or more of the following:

(a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner,

(b) that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner,

(c) that the prosecution unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested either that the accused person might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought,

(d) that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award costs.

(2)   This section does not apply to the awarding of costs against a prosecutor acting in a private capacity.


	
	Section 116 of the Act should be read in the context of section 117. Section 116 specifies when costs may be awarded and s 117 limits the circumstances when those costs may be awarded against a public officer. Relevantly the limitations in s 117 focus on unreasonable or improper actions in the investigation, or prosecution or conduct of the proceedings. For example s 117 refers to the following considerations: that the investigation was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner; that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner; that the prosecution unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter; or for other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings, by the prosecutor, the award of costs is just and reasonable. Section 117 is clearly directed at whether there was some impropriety or unreasonable actions by investigators and/or prosecutors. To further restrict an accused’s access to costs, in the way argued for by the respondent in this matter, would arguably defeat the expressed intention of the legislature that some deficiency or improper conduct by investigators or prosecutor, may see costs awarded in favour of an accused.
	
	
	Consistently with the view of Justice Simpson referred to above, a further restriction on the ability of an accused to recover costs, by adopting the construction put forward by the respondent, could lead to unjust results and to costs not being awarded in cases where it would be ordinarily justified.
	
	
	For all the above stated reasons I am of the view that an accused may apply for costs pursuant to s 116 of the Act, at the end of committal proceedings when the charge is withdrawn, and that committal proceedings include all proceedings before the court in relation to the committal proceedings, from the commencement of proceedings, with the issue/filing of the CAN, until the end of the proceedings. In the current matter there is jurisdiction for the application for costs.

		21 December 2015",2015-11-23 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2768269,Potier v The New South Wales State Parole Authority [2015] NSWSC 1775,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff, Malcolm Huntley Potier, commenced these proceedings by way of Summons filed in this Court on 12 November 2015.
	
	
	On 19 November 2015, Mr Potier filed a Notice of Motion in proceedings 2015/332753 in which he sought the following orders:
	



	
	That the Court of its own Motion do receive and consider the Applicant’s Information of the 18 November 2015.
	
	
	That the Court do grant the Applicant a Warrant under section 151 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (“the Act”).
	



	
	The application made by the plaintiff was listed and heard in the Duty Judge List on Tuesday, 24 November 2015. On that occasion Mr Brendan Lim of counsel appeared on behalf of the Minister for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the second defendant) (“the Minister”), and Ms E Sullivan appeared on behalf of the State Parole Authority and the Department of Corrective Services (the first and third defendants).
	
	
	On 19 November 2015, the plaintiff filed an affidavit which was sworn by him on 18 November 2015. In it he stated, inter alia:
	


“2   My Earliest Possible Release Date was August 2013.

3.   Against my wishes, and in absence of any application by myself for parole, this was granted on the 21st October 2015.

4.   This morning I attended before the Registry of this Court in a Call Over of the matter, present were instructed [sic] solicitors for the Respondents; certain Orders were made.

5.   On my return to this Centre [Villawood Detention Centre] I was required to attend a meeting with Immigration Case Officer Mr Kam Kumar and an Officer identified as Julie, from the Australian Border Force. Amongst other things we discussed the Call Over of this morning, that they were fully aware of the issues.

6.   At 3:40 pm the Border Force Officer informed me that they had ‘started the removal process’, which I take to mean that they are planning to deport me very soon despite knowing of these proceedings. I interpret this to mean that there is a real possibility that I could be deported before this Application is resolved.

7.   As a result of this situation I now lay this Information to this Court for the grant of a Criminal Justice Stay Warrant, under Section 151 of the Migration Act 1958 that will enable me to remain in this Court[‘]s Jurisdiction.”


	
	On 19 November 2015, the plaintiff also filed a document entitled “Statement of Issues’. In that document, in the nature of submissions, the plaintiff contended:
	


“3.   This Court has the authority, of its own motion, ie not as a result of any Application I can make to grant a Criminal Justice Stay Warrant under Section 151 of the Migration Act 1958 which states

…”


	
	The plaintiff also stated in that document:
	


“7.   It is the case that the legislation does refer to criminal matters but it [is] submitted that these proceedings before the Common Law Division are in effect ‘quasi criminal’ proceedings in that it concerns myself and my ongoing custody and furthermore this Court it is submitted, has the power and authority to control its own proceedings before it.”


	
	The plaintiff in his oral submissions on 24 November 2015, referred to the proceedings instituted by the Summons filed on 12 November 2015 in relation to his submission as to the Court’s jurisdiction under s 23 of the Supreme Court Act 1970.
	


Submissions


	
	The plaintiff appeared on his own behalf and made oral submissions in support of the Notice of Motion filed on 19 November 2015.
	
	
	Written submissions dated 23 November 2015 were relied upon on by Mr Lim on behalf of the Minister and Ms Sullivan relied upon written submissions dated 23 November 2015 prepared on behalf of the Commissioner for the Department of Corrective Services.
	


Background


	
	The background to the plaintiff’s application was conveniently summarised in the written submissions on behalf of the Commissioner. What follows is drawn from paragraphs 4-7 of those submissions.
	
	
	The plaintiff has in all been convicted in New South Wales on three charges of soliciting murder. The sentences for the first two of the convictions has expired. The head sentence for the third conviction imposed on 13 November 2006 (see para [16] below) expires on 6 August 2018.
	
	
	The earliest possible release date for the plaintiff to parole in respect of the second conviction was 6 August 2013.
	


History of Further Proceedings


	
	Subsequent to the imposition of the sentences in respect of the two counts for which Mr Potier was sentenced on 10 May 2002, the Crown filed a Notice of Appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence. Mr Potier appealed against his conviction and made application for leave to appeal the sentence imposed.
	
	
	The two sentence appeals were heard together. On 25 August 2004, the Court of Criminal Appeal refused Mr Potier leave to appeal against sentence and allowed the Crown appeal: R v Potier [2004] NSWCCA 136. The Court of Criminal Appeal re-sentenced him as follows:
	


3.   Quash the sentences below, and in lieu thereof:

(a)   sentence the defendant, in relation to Count 2, to a term of imprisonment for 6 years and 8 months, to commence from 8 May 2000, with a non-parole period of 5 years, similarly to commence from 8 May 2000 and to expire on 7 May 2005;

(b)   sentence the defendant in relation to Count 1 to a term of imprisonment for 6 years and 8 months, to commence from 8 May 2002, with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months, to commence from 8 May 2002 and to expire on 7 August 2006.


	
	On 17 February 2006, the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed Mr Potier’s appeal against conviction: Potier v R [2006] NSWCCA 27. A Special Leave application filed by Mr Potier in relation to the convictions was subsequently dismissed.
	
	
	On 3 October 2006, Mr Potier was convicted of a charge of soliciting a person to murder Ms Oswald between 1 January 2002 and 8 February 2002. On 13 November 2006, Shadbolt DCJ sentenced him to imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of 7 years expiring on 6 August 2013. His subsequent appeal was not heard until 10 November 2014.
	
	
	Earlier, on 15 August 2014, Garling J, in the course of case managing the proceedings in the Court of Criminal Appeal, heard an application for the issue of a criminal justice stay warrant pursuant to s 151 of the Act: Potier v R [2014] NSWCCA 157. The application was dismissed. In his Honour’s judgment, he noted that the State Parole Authority was at that time scheduled to conduct a further hearing on 13 August 2014 on the question of whether or not Mr Potier ought to be granted parole. As at the date of Garling J’s judgment the outcome of the scheduled hearing before that Authority was unknown.
	
	
	In the application for the issue of a criminal justice stay warrant heard by Garling J Mr Potier had expressed fears that he would not be permitted by the Commonwealth immigration authorities to return to Australia for the purposes of the conduct of his appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal. Garling J noted at [11] that Mr Potier expressed apprehension that if he was deported to the United Kingdom he would be unable to prosecute his appeal, that it would lapse and that he would not have an opportunity to rectify what he asserted was an erroneous conviction.
	
	
	In his judgment Garling J considered the relevant authorities in relation to the provisions of s 151(1) of the Act. His Honour concluded:
	


“[33]   I am also of the view, as Lindgren J said in Lee at [5]–[6], that the proper interpretation of this legislation means that s 151 does not on its terms give the Court a power to grant a warrant, but rather assumes the existence of courts that are otherwise invested with the power to issue criminal justice warrants. The Act has no provision that specifically invests this Court with the power to issue a warrant.

[34]   It is a nice question as to whether s 23 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 is a sufficient jurisdictional base for the existence of a power in this Court to issue the warrant. It is unnecessary for me to decide that question, and it is appropriate that it be reserved to an occasion when the Court has the benefit of considered submissions on the issue.”


	
	On 3 August 2015, the Court of Criminal Appeal in Application of Malcolm Potier [2015] NSWCCA 199 made orders to the following effect:
	


(1)   The application to review the decision of the State Parole Authority is dismissed.

(2)   The application to appeal from the judgment of Garling J of 15 August 2014 is dismissed.

(3)   Release application dismissed and bail is refused.


	
	Mr Lim of counsel in the course of his submissions in the present proceedings observed that although the Court of Criminal Appeal in that case had considered the question of jurisdiction under s 151 of the Act, and accepted that it had jurisdiction under that provision to issue a warrant referred to in s 151. The Court, however, had not been referred to relevant authorities, including in particular the judgment of Lindgren J in Lee v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 171 FCR 38.
	
	
	In his Honour’s judgment on the question of whether a warrant should be issued under s 151, Davies J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Hamill J agreed) observed:
	


“61.   … If Mr Potier cannot establish that he has reasonable prospects that the court will order a new trial there would be no basis under s 151 for the court to issue a stay warrant for the purposes of the administration of justice.”


	
	A little later his Honour observed:
	


“70   having regard to the limited nature of a rule 50C application and the material put forward by Mr Potier, I consider that he has a minimal prospect of achieving a different outcome in his appeal. He, therefore, fails to show that any purpose of the administration of criminal justice requires his presence in this country.”


	
	On 14 September 2015, the Court of Criminal Appeal in Application of Malcolm Potier (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 249 refused an application under r 50C, the Court noting at [18] that the application attempted to re-argue matters already considered in the previous principal judgment.
	


Grant of Parole – Plaintiff an Unlawful Non-Citizen


	
	On 2 October 2015, the NSW State Parole Authority made an order granting the plaintiff parole. By the summons filed on 12 November 2015 – to which reference has been made above – the plaintiff seeks review of the parole order.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a national of the United Kingdom. He presently does not hold a visa. Accordingly, he is an unlawful non-citizen within the meaning of s 14 of the Act.
	
	
	Section 189(1) of the Act  requires an “officer” (defined in s 5 of the Act) to detain a person if the officer knows or reasonably suspects that a person in the migration zone, which includes New South Wales, is an unlawful non-citizen.
	
	
	Consistently with that obligation, upon the plaintiff’s release from custody, officers of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection took the plaintiff into immigration detention.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 196(1) of the Act the plaintiff will be kept in immigration detention until relevantly he is removed from Australia under s 198. Section 196(1) of the Act prescribes other events which mark the limits of an unlawful non-citizen’s detention under s 189 of the Act.
	


Proceedings no. 2015/332753


	
	As stated above, the present application by the plaintiff was brought by way of Notice of Motion filed 19 November 2015 in proceedings No. 2015/332753.
	
	
	The proceedings were instituted against “The responsible officer, NSW State Parole Authority (first defendant), the Minister for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (second defendant) and the NSW Commissioner for the Department of Corrective Services (third defendant)”.
	
	
	The relief claimed in the Summons is expressed in the following terms:
	


“1   The Plaintiff asserts that he has suffered, and continues to suffer, an injustice by principally the actions of the First Defendant and subsequently the Second & Third Defendants, for the reasons as set out in his submissions and affidavit.

2   The Plaintiff seeks the intervention of this Court to protect him from this injustice.

3   The Plaintiff seeks Orders of this Court as set out in the Notice of Motion restoring his position at law, which are

1/ That the Plaintiff has not been released on Parole at law

2/ That the Second Defendant do return the Plaintiff to the ongoing custody of the NSW Commissioner for Corrective Services the Third Defendant and thereafter be dealt with according to law.

3/ That Leave be granted, if Leave be required, for the Plaintiff to make and lodge his Application under the Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act.

4/ any other Orders that this Court may see fit to grant.”


	
	On the same date, 12 November 2015, the plaintiff filed a Notice of Motion in which the orders sought were stated as follows:
	


“ORDERS SOUGHT

1   That the Plaintiff has not been released on Parole law.

2   That the Second Defendant do return the Plaintiff to the ongoing custody of the NSW Commissioner for Corrective Services the Third Defendant and thereafter be dealt with according to law.

3   That Leave be granted, if Leave be required, for the Plaintiff to make and lodge his Application under the Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act.

4   Any other Orders that this Court may see fit to grant.”


	
	The proceedings that have been brought on the abovementioned Summons remain current and in the ordinary course would be expected to be the subject of case management orders and directions.
	


The Relevant Legislation


	
	Part 2, Division 4 of the Act – Criminal justice visitors - contains a number of subdivisions. Subdivision A – Preliminary - sets out, inter alia, interpretative provisions. Subdivision B – Criminal justice certificates for entry - contains provisions whereby the Attorney-General (Cth) may grant a Commonwealth criminal justice entry certificate for the temporary presence in Australia of a non-citizen who is outside Australia for specified purposes: s 145(1)(a).
	
	
	Section 146 makes provision for an authorised official of a State to give a certificate that the presence of a non-citizen in Australia is required for the administration of criminal justice by the State: s 146(1).
	
	
	Subdivision C – Criminal justice certificates etc staying removal or deportation - contains provisions that are relevant to the present proceedings.
	
	
	Section 147 provides power in the Attorney-General (Cth) to give a certificate for the stay of a non-citizen’s removal or deportation, required for the administration of criminal justice.
	
	
	Section 148 similarly confers power on an authorised official for a State to issue a State criminal justice stay certificate where the official considers that the non-citizen should remain in Australia temporarily for the purposes of the administration of criminal justice in relation to an offence against a law of the State: s 148(1).
	
	
	Section 150 of the Act provides that if a criminal justice stay certificate about a non-citizen is in force, the non-citizen is not to be removed or deported.
	
	
	The present proceedings are concerned with the provisions for the issue of a criminal justice stay warrant in respect of a non-citizen.
	
	
	Section 151 is in the following terms:
	


151 Certain warrants stay removal or deportation

(1)   If an unlawful non-citizen is to be, or is likely to be, removed or deported, this Act does not prevent a court issuing for the purposes of the administration of criminal justice in relation to an offence against a law a warrant to stay the removal or deportation.

(2)   If a criminal justice stay warrant about a non-citizen is in force, the non-citizen is not to be removed or deported.

(3)   If a court issues a criminal justice stay warrant about a non-citizen the applicant for the warrant is responsible for the costs of any maintenance or accommodation (other than immigration detention) of the non-citizen while the warrant is in force.


	
	Subdivision D – Criminal justice visas - makes provision for the issue of a criminal justice visa permitting a non-citizen to travel to and enter and remain temporarily in Australia (known as a criminal justice entry visa): s 155.
	
	
	Section 158 provides the criteria for criminal justice visas.
	
	
	Finally subdivision E is concerned with the cancellation etc of criminal justice certificates and criminal justice visas.
	
	
	In subdivision A, section 144 states the objects of Division 4 of Part 2 of the Act. It is in the following terms:
	


144 Object of Division

This Division is enacted so that, if the administration of criminal justice requires the presence in Australia of a non-citizen, that non-citizen may be brought to, or allowed to stay in, Australia for the purposes of that administration.


	
	The term “administration of criminal justice” is defined in s 142 to mean:
	


(a)   an investigation to find out whether an offence has been committed; or

(b)   the prosecution of a person for an offence; or

(c)   the punishment by way of imprisonment of a person for the commission of an offence.


	
	The provisions of s 142 are to be brought into account in the consideration of the provisions of s 151 of the Act.
	
	
	The provisions, inter alia, of s 151 has been the subject of detailed consideration by the Federal Court (Lindgren J) in Lee v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 171 FCR 38.
	
	
	In Lee Lindgren J considered that the references in the definition of “administration of criminal justice” to investigation, prosecution and punishment:
	


“… make it clear that the relevant perspective is that of the administrators of the criminal justice system, not that of a person who may be suspected of having committed a criminal offence, or who is being or has been or may be punished by way of imprisonment for the commission of an offence.” (at [9]).


	
	In so concluding, Lindgren J had regard in particular to the scheme established by the provisions of Division 4. In particular:
	



	
	Subdivision B which provides for the issue of criminal justice entry certificates.
	
	
	Subdivision C which is “concerned with unlawful non-citizens who are to be or who are likely to be removed or deported”. That subdivision makes provision for the Commonwealth Attorney-General or the authorised State official to give a certificate that the stay of a non-citizen’s removal or deportation is required for the administration of criminal justice (see the provisions of ss 147-148 above); and
	
	
	For a court to grant a criminal justice warrant (s 151).
	



	
	In the written submissions for the Minister, supplemented by oral submissions at the hearing, the scheme for criminal justice visitors under the Act was addressed in detail, it being submitted on behalf of the Minister that s 151 of the Act is not a source of power to issue a criminal justice stay warrant as the plaintiff contends and that there is an absence of any other identified power to issue a warrant: Written Submissions for the Minister at [11].
	
	
	As to the scheme, it was observed that Part 2 of the Act is generally concerned with the control of the arrival and presence in Australia of non-citizens. Unlawful non-citizens in the migration zone must be detained and are liable to removal from Australia: s 189(1) and s 198.
	
	
	It was submitted that the general provisions in the Act in respect of applications for visas do not apply to criminal justice visas: s 44(1).
	
	
	It was noted at [15] of the written submissions for the Minister that Division 4 of Part 2 of the Act provides for non-citizens to be brought to, or allowed to stay, in Australia “… if the administration of criminal justice requires their presence in Australia”: s 141.
	
	
	The provisions conferring power on the Attorney-General (Cth) or an authorised official for a State in respect of a “criminal justice stay certificate” was addressed and contrasted with those provisions concerned with a “criminal justice stay warrant” as defined in s 142 (being a warrant described in s 151).
	
	
	Submissions were made in respect of the statutory language employed in Division 4 in respect of the expression “criminal justice entry certificate” which is defined in s 142, inter alia, as a certificate “given under” s 145 or s 146(1). The expression “criminal justice stay certificate” is defined (in s 142) as a certificate “given under” s 147 or s 148. However, the expression “criminal justice stay warrant” is described as meaning “a warrant described in s 151” (emphasis added). The choice of language, it was submitted, in effect, was intentional and reflect the nature of a criminal justice stay warrant under s 151.
	
	
	It was further submitted that the provisions of s 151 do not operate so as to confer a power on a court to issue a criminal justice stay warrant:
	


“… rather, it assumes the existence of courts that are otherwise invested with such power. That is the ratio decidendi of Lindgren J’s decision in Lee v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship … with which Garling J agreed in Potier v R [2014] NSWCCA 157 at [33]. It is also the plain and ordinary meaning of the statutory text, which is that the Act ‘does not prevent’ a court from issuing a warrant for the stated purpose. A Full Court of the Federal Court described s 151 as having merely “left open” (rather than having created) an “alternative means of securing the presence of an unlawful non-citizen in Australia”: Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Zhang (2009) 179 FCR 135 at 39 [33] (Stone, Jacobson and Forster JJ). That plain meaning is confirmed by the relevant context, namely, the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill that introduced what is now s 151, which said that the section  “ensures that the powers created by [Div 4] do not interfere with the power of a court to issue a warrant requiring that a non-citizen not be removed or deported.” (Written Submissions for the Minister at [23]).


	
	It was submitted for the Minister that the statements of the Court of Criminal of Appeal in Application of Malcolm Potier [2015] NSWCCA 199 at [56] and Application of Malcolm Potier (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 249 at [17], were erroneous and that the decisions in those cases are not binding on this Court in circumstances in which the relevant statutory issues considered in Lee v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship were not argued before the Court of Criminal Appeal in either of those cases, it appearing that, for reasons not readily apparent, there was no appearance for the Crown in the former of those proceedings.
	
	
	It was further submitted for the Minister that there is no alternative source of power for the Court to grant a criminal justice stay warrant. At the hearing, Mr Potier stated that he relied on the provisions of s 23 of the Supreme Court Act 1970. The written submissions for the Minister advert to an observation made by Garling J in the decision of Potier v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 157 in which his Honour noted that whether s 23 of the Supreme Court Act conferred the relevant power was a “nice question.”
	
	
	It was submitted for the Minister that there is nothing incongruous in a conclusion that there is no power to issue a criminal justice warrant. The purpose of s 151 is simply to leave open the possibility that the various legislatures, including the State legislatures, might make provisions for courts to grant such warrants. It was contended that the scheme of the Act would not be undermined by the absence of such a power. The Act itself, it was noted, conferred power on identified officials to grant criminal justice stay certificates and that these adequately fulfil the central purpose of Division 4.
	
	
	A submission was also made on behalf of the Minister that it would not be open to conclude that this Court may exercise a power of its own motion to grant a criminal justice stay warrant. In support, reference was made to the provisions of s 151(3) which imposes responsibility for the costs of the non-citizen’s maintenance and accommodation on “the applicant for the warrant”.
	
	
	It was submitted that the Explanatory Memorandum to the legislation also provides support for this proposition.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Minister that the Notice of Motion filed on 19 November 2015 should be dismissed with costs.
	
	
	Ms Sullivan who appeared on behalf of the Commissioner for the Department of Corrective Services relied upon written submissions of Ms Mitchelmore of counsel dated 23 November 2015. Ms Sullivan additionally relied upon the submissions made by Mr Lim on behalf of the Minister.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of the Commissioner, similarly to the submissions for the Minister, that the Court does not have power to grant a warrant under s 151 of the Act in the absence of an application from a law enforcement agency: Written Submissions at [3]. It was formally submitted that the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Potier v R [2015] NSWCCA 199 should not be followed.
	
	
	It was also submitted for the Commissioner that the court would in any event not be satisfied that this is a case in which it would be appropriate to grant a warrant.
	
	
	The submissions for the Commissioner referred to and relied upon observations of French J (as his Honour then was) in Goldie v Commonwealth [2002] FCA 261 in respect of ss 147-148 of the Act, and in addition the observations of Lindgren J in Lee.
	
	
	It was noted that the expression “administration of criminal justice” does not bear its ordinary meaning but is an expression that is defined from the perspective of the administrators of the criminal justice system: Written Submissions for the Commissioner at [17].
	


Consideration


	
	The terms of s 151 do not confer upon any person or class of persons other than persons described by Lindgren J as “administrators of the criminal justice system” a right to make an application for the issue or grant of a criminal justice stay warrant.
	
	
	The terms of s 151 do not, in particular, empower or vest any rights upon an unlawful non-citizen to make application for a criminal justice stay warrant.
	
	
	The provisions of s 141 – Objects of Division, and those in s 142 defining “criminal justice stay warrant” together with the provisions of s 151 (in particular s 151(3)), all indicate that “the applicant for the warrant” is a person other than “a non-citizen”.
	
	
	Further, the provisions of s 151 are expressed in terms that “this Act [the Migration Act] does not prevent a court issuing for the purposes of the administration of criminal justice … etc.” does not create or confer jurisdiction to issue a warrant (a criminal justice stay warrant) in the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
	
	
	In general terms, statutory provisions that confer upon judicial officers or other officials or tribunals a power to issue warrants of specified kinds (for example, for the issue of search warrants, surveillance device warrants or warrants for possession) are issued upon application made to authorised officers. There is no basis for the submission made by the plaintiff that this Court may, of its own motion, issue a criminal justice stay warrant under s 151. Mr Potier, I note, accepted that he does not have standing to apply for such a warrant.
	
	
	The provisions of Division 4, construed as a whole, indicate that the evident purpose of s 151 is to facilitate the administration of criminal justice in permitting a non-citizen to remain in Australia for the purpose of, or in relation to what is prescribed in s 142:
	



	
	An investigation to find out whether an offence has been committed; or
	
	
	The prosecution of a person for an offence; or
	
	
	The punishment by way of imprisonment of a person for the commission of an offence.
	



	
	The “applicant for the warrant” referred to s 151(3) is clearly intended as a reference to an application made by a person or persons involved in the activities or processes concerned with the administration of criminal justice in one or more of the matters referred to in [75] above (investigation, prosecution and/or punishment of a person).
	
	
	Whilst the Court of Criminal Appeal in Application of Malcolm Potier [2015] NSWCCA 199 proceeded on the basis that the Court of Criminal Appeal had jurisdiction under s 151 of the Act, I accept, as was submitted on behalf of the Minister, that that aspect of the decision is not binding on this Court, it does not form part of the ratio of the case. Further, the question of whether the Court had jurisdiction under s 151 was not addressed or argued in light of the relevant authorities: Written Submissions for the Minister at [24]. Unusually, as noted in those submissions there appears to have been no appearance for the Crown in those proceedings, Mr Potier appearing in person.
	


Supreme Court Jurisdiction: Section 23 Supreme Court Act 1970


	
	The plaintiff additionally relied in the course of his oral submissions upon the Court’s jurisdiction as stated in s 23 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) which is in the following terms:
	


23   The Court shall have all jurisdiction which may be necessary for the administration of justice in New South Wales.


	
	The Supreme Court is a superior court of record and as such has an inherent jurisdiction in addition to its specific statutory jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of the Court under its inherent jurisdiction and under s 23 is limited by the requirements of the administration of justice.
	
	
	In this respect, the plaintiff points to the fact that the proceedings commenced by him by way of Summons filed on 12 November 2015 are current proceedings in this Court which it may be presumed will be the subject of case management directions. The plaintiff has contended that his presence in the jurisdiction for the purpose of conducting those proceedings would support the grant of relief by way of stay based on the jurisdiction under s 23 of the Supreme Court Act, thereby providing him with the ability to conduct the proceedings. If he were to be deported to the United Kingdom, he submitted, difficulties may be expected to confront him in pursuing the proceedings.
	
	
	I have earlier referred to the relief sought in the Summons filed on 12 November 2015 and the Notice of Motion the subject of the present hearing.
	
	
	The nature of the alleged “injustice” in respect of which relief is claimed in the Summons, and the bases or grounds relied upon for the orders sought, are not framed in precise terms. The centre of the relief sought in the Summons appears to be based on a challenge to the decision whereby the plaintiff was released to parole.
	
	
	I note that the document prepared by the plaintiff entitled “Statement of Issues” contains the following statements:
	


“1   The issue relates to the conduct of the First Defendant acting in excess of his legislative authority in granting parole when he be fully aware that he had no power to make such Orders.

2   This Application seeks to return me to custody, in accordance with law.

3   I refer to my affidavit of today’s date which sets out the recent events relating to my Parole.

4   The matter of grant of Parole is governed by the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 and in particular Part 6.

5   The legislation is quite clear and unambiguous and for an Offender such as myself CRIMES (ADMINISTRATION OF SENTENCES) ACT 1999 - SECT 143”


	
	In addition it is asserted in the Statement of Issues:
	


“7   It is the case that at the Earliest Possible Release date the Parole Authority has to consider the granting of parole.

8   However in subsequent years, at the ‘offender’s annual review date’ it is only the offender who can apply for Parole; there are absolutely no provisions, under the Act for the Parole Authority to consider Parole, of its own Motion.” (emphasis in original)


	
	The written submissions relied upon by the plaintiff, filed on 19 November 2015, do not elaborate upon these issues and there is no evidence by the plaintiff from which the prospects of the plaintiff obtaining any form of relief sought can be evaluated. There is, in my opinion, an onus upon the plaintiff, in a case in which relief in the nature of a stay order is sought, to establish that he has reasonable prospects in the proceedings which have been instituted by him in this Court. That has not been established.
	
	
	In any event, as I have earlier indicated, this Court does not have jurisdiction on any basis to grant relief in the nature of a criminal justice warrant under s 151 of the Act. No other basis exists in these circumstances for the exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction under s 23 of the Supreme Court Act. In particular, it has not been established that the exercise of the jurisdiction under s 23 is necessary for the administration of justice in New South Wales.
	
	
	I have accordingly concluded:
	


(1)   That the Notice of Motion filed on 19 November 2015 be dismissed.

(2)   Unless written application is made to my Associate within seven days for a different order, order the plaintiff to pay the defendants’ costs of the Notice of Motion filed on 19 November 2015.

2768274,NSW Police Force v Katrina Golding [2015] NSWLC 26,"Judgment


	
	This matter concerns an issue raised on behalf of Ms Katrina Golding (the Defendant) as to whether the Local Court has jurisdiction to hear proceedings once an order has been made under s 33(1)(b) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (‘MHFPA’) and where a finding is made under the Mental Health Act 2007 (‘MHA’) that the person is mentally ill. The defendant argues that the Court has no jurisdiction in such circumstances. The prosecution does not agree with these assertions.
	
	
	The defendant has an extensive criminal history and has had a number of charges dealt with pursuant to both s 32 and s 33 of the MHFPA. The charges which are the subject of this decision are:
	



	
	H57871004: offensive manner;
	
	
	H58140705: custody of a knife;
	
	
	H59339769: offensive language and goods in custody;
	
	
	H54197519: assault police (s 9 bond call up);
	
	
	H54576721: assault occasioning actual bodily harm (s 9 bond call up);
	
	
	H58715045: offensive manner, assault police and malicious damage.
	



	
	It is necessary to reproduce the relevant legislative sections throughout this judgment in order to understand the operation and link between both the MHFPA and the MHA.

Progress in Hospital/Summary of Stay

Ms Katrina Golding is a 20 year old indigenous lady, DSP (disability support pension) living with grandmother, known to the community health team in POW…and previously been admitted to Caritas for a Drug Induces psychosis.

Ms Golding was discharged from POWH on 24 August this year (3 days prior to presentation) on 15mg Olanzapine nocte. She failed to attend her follow up appointment and is advised to contact the team at Prince of Wales to reschedule this appointment.

Ms Golding was brought to Caritas by police under section 33 for mental health assessment. During police custody, she was labile in affect, disorganised in behaviour, agitated on arrival in ED requiring IV sedation. On admissions she expressed delusional thought content, remained labile in affect. She stated “I am Eve”, “I am married to Adam”, “I have a plan to end the world”.

During admission, Katrina admitted she had used THC. She also became increasingly aggressive and she needed to be sent to seclusion as she was agitated and verbally abusive towards staff, she stayed in seclusion for 2 hours.

After 3 days, Katrina was compliant with medication, and was interacting appropriately with fellow patients and nursing staff. On review she denied her presenting symptoms but did admit to cannabis use. She was logical, polite, co-operative and expressed no delusions, and had no apparent perceptions. She easily became rude and demanding when her needs were not met instantly, but was agreeable to discharge into Police custody. She is no longer presenting any psychotic symptoms and does not present any suicidal ideation or risk to others.

RELEVANT LEGISLATION

The Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990


	
	The MHFPA is intended to provide a legislative scheme for diverting defendants out of the criminal process and into treatment for mental health problems where treatment is urgently required.
	
	
	Sections 32 and 33 deal with the diversionary processes available to the Local Court. This matter however concerns the operation of s 33(1)(b) predominantly.
	
	
	Section 33 of the MHFPA:
	


(1) If, at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a Magistrate, it appears to the Magistrate that the defendant is a mentally ill person, the Magistrate (without derogating from any other order the Magistrate may make in relation to the defendant, whether by way of adjournment, the granting of bail in accordance with the Bail Act 2013 or otherwise):

(a) may order that the defendant be taken to, and detained in, a mental health facility for assessment, or

(b) may order that the defendant be taken to, and detained in, a mental health facility for assessment and that, if the defendant is found on assessment at the mental health facility not to be a mentally ill person or mentally disordered person, the person be brought back before a Magistrate or an authorised officer, or

(c) may discharge the defendant, unconditionally or subject to conditions, into the care of a responsible person.

(2) If a defendant is dealt with at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a Magistrate or authorised officer in accordance with this section, the charge which gave rise to the proceedings, on the expiration of the period of 6 months after the date on which the defendant is so dealt with, is to be taken to have been dismissed unless, within that period, the defendant is brought before a Magistrate to be further dealt with in relation to the charge.

(3) If a defendant is brought before a Magistrate to be further dealt with in relation to a charge as referred to in subsection (2), the Magistrate must, in dealing with the charge, take account of any period during which the defendant was in a mental health facility as a consequence of an order made under this section.

(4) The fact that charges are to be taken to have been dismissed under subsection (2) does not constitute a finding that the charges against the defendant are proven or otherwise.

The Mental Health Act 2007


	
	Part 2 of the MHA deals with the involuntary detention and treatment of persons in mental health facilities. Division 2 of the MHA deals with admission to and initial detention in mental health facilities. The division contains a number of sections which are directly relevant to the powers of the Court and members of the Police Force concerning the detention, arrest, discharge or return to Court of a person subject to assessment following Court orders.
	
	
	Section 18 states (emphasis added):
	


18 When a person may be detained in mental health facility

(1) A person may be detained in a declared mental health facility in the following circumstances:

(a) on a mental health certificate given by a medical practitioner or accredited person (see section 19),

(b) after being brought to the facility by an ambulance officer (see section 20),

(c) after being apprehended by a police officer (see section 22),

(d) after an order for an examination and an examination or observation by a medical practitioner or accredited person (see section 23),

(e) on the order of a Magistrate or bail officer (see section 24),

(f) after a transfer from another health facility (see section 25),

(g) on a written request made to the authorised medical officer by a designated carer, the principal care provider, a relative or friend of the person (see section 26).

(2) A person may be detained, under a provision of this Part, in a health facility that is not a declared mental health facility if it is necessary to do so to provide medical treatment or care to the person for a condition or illness other than a mental illness or other mental condition.

(3) In this Act, a reference to taking to and detaining in a mental health facility includes, in relation to a person who is at a mental health facility, but not detained in the mental health facility in accordance with this Act, the detaining of the person in the mental health facility.


	
	The Court’s power to order the detention of a person is outlined in s 18(1)(e) and s 24 of the MHA, as well as s 33 of the MHFPA.
	
	
	Section 24 of the MHA states:
	


24 Detention on order of Magistrate or bail officer 

A person may be taken to and detained in a declared mental health facility in accordance with an order made under section 33 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.


	
	When a person is detained under Division 2 of the MHA, certain procedures or steps must be taken to ensure that the person is examined. These steps are outlined in s 27 of the MHA.
	
	
	There is an important distinction to note in relation to whether a person is detained as a ‘mentally ill person’ or a ‘mentally disordered person’. Both conditions are defined in the MHA as follows:
	


14 Mentally ill persons 

(1) A person is a mentally ill person if the person is suffering from mental illness and, owing to that illness, there are reasonable grounds for believing that care, treatment or control of the person is necessary:

(a) for the person’s own protection from serious harm, or

(b) for the protection of others from serious harm.

(2) In considering whether a person is a mentally ill person, the continuing condition of the person, including any likely deterioration in the person’s condition and the likely effects of any such deterioration, are to be taken into account.

15 Mentally disordered persons 

A person (whether or not the person is suffering from mental illness) is a mentally disordered person if the person’s behaviour for the time being is so irrational as to justify a conclusion on reasonable grounds that temporary care, treatment or control of the person is necessary:

(a) for the person’s own protection from serious physical harm, or

(b) for the protection of others from serious physical harm.


	
	The distinction is important to note because s 33(1)(b) of the MHFPA mentions both classifications. A mentally disordered person must not be detained in a mental health facility for a continuous period of more than 3 days: s 31(1) of the MHA.
	
	
	If a person is not to be detained or further detained in a facility following an order of a Magistrate, s 32 of the MHA dictates what actions may be taken:
	


32 Detention on order of Magistrate or bail officer

(1) This section applies to a person detained in a mental health facility under this Part who is required not to be detained or further detained in the facility and who was taken to the facility:

(a) by a police officer under this Division after being apprehended by a police officer because the officer believed the person to be committing or to have recently committed an offence, or

(b)on the order of a Magistrate or an authorised officer under section 33 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.

(2) An authorised medical officer must release the person into the custody of any relevant person who is present at the mental health facility to ascertain the results of any examination or examinations of the person.

(3) If a relevant person is not so present when the authorised medical officer becomes aware that the person must not be detained or further detained, the authorised medical officer must, as soon as practicable, notify a police officer at the appropriate police station that the person will not be further detained.

(4) The authorised medical officer may take any of the following actions in relation to a person (other than a person referred to in subsection (5)), after considering any matter communicated by a police officer as to the intended apprehension of the person by a police officer:

(a) detain the person for a period not exceeding 2 hours pending the person’s apprehension by a police officer,

(b) admit the person in accordance with this Act as a voluntary patient,

(c) discharge the person, in so far as it may be possible to do so, into the care of a designated carer or the principal care provider of the person,

(d) discharge the person.

(5) If the person is a person ordered to be brought back before a court under section 33 (1) (b) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990:

(a) it is the duty of the police officer notified by the authorised medical officer to ensure that a police officer attends the mental health facility and apprehends the person as soon as practicable after notification, and

(b) the authorised medical officer must detain the person pending the person’s apprehension by a police officer.

(6) A police officer may apprehend a person under this section without a warrant.

(7) In subsections (2) and (3):

“relevant person” means:

(a) if the detained person was taken to the mental health facility on an order under section 33 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, any person (including a police officer) charged by the order with taking the person from the facility, or

(b) in any other case, a police officer.


	
	From the time an order under s 33(1)(b) of the MHFPA is made, a person remains in continuous detention. If the person is admitted for treatment, their detention continues under the provisions of the MHA. This is clear by the use of the words ‘further detained’ in s 32(1) of the MHA.
	
	
	Through the operation of both Acts, and in particular s 32(5) of the MHA, if a Court makes an order pursuant to s 33(1)(b) of the MHFPA and the person is not detained in a mental health facility after assessment, Police are required to take the defendant back to court and the matter is then to be further dealt with: s 32(5)(a) MHA. It is the duty of the authorised medical officer in the mental health facility to ‘detain the person pending the person’s apprehension by a police officer’: s 32(5)(b) MHA.
	
	
	Police officers are authorised to take persons subject to these provisions ‘to or from’ mental health facilities pursuant to clause 13 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Regulations 2009:
	


13 Transport of defendants in Local Court proceedings

For the purposes of section 33 of the Act, the following persons are prescribed as persons who may take a defendant to or from a place:

(a) if the defendant is on remand or serving a sentence of imprisonment (other than a defendant detained in a detention centre)—a correctional officer or other officer employed in the Department of Corrective Services or a police officer,

(b) if the defendant is a juvenile and is detained in a detention centre—an officer employed in the Department of Juvenile Justice,

(c) in any other case—a member of staff of the NSW Health Service, a police officer, a correctional officer or other officer employed in the Department of Corrective Services, an officer employed in the Department of Juvenile Justice or a person who provides a transport service approved for that purpose by the Director-General.

Consideration of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990


	
	If a person has been detained under s 33(1)(b) of the MHFPA and the person is brought back before Court, s 33(3) of the MHFPA provides that any period of time spent in the mental health facility as a consequence of the order must be taken into account when dealing with the charge.
	
	
	If the person is dealt with by way of admission, s 33(2) of the MHFPA provides the following:
	


If a defendant is dealt with at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a Magistrate or authorised officer in accordance with this section, the charge which gave rise to the proceedings, on the expiration of the period of 6 months after the date on which the defendant is so dealt with, is to be taken to have been dismissed unless, within that period, the defendant is brought before a Magistrate to be further dealt with in relation to the charge.


	
	The phrase ‘unless…the defendant is brought before a Magistrate to be further dealt with in relation to the charge’ is indicative of the intention of the Parliament that the making of an order pursuant to s 33(1)(b) of the MHFPA does not dismiss the charges. The charges are still on foot until and unless the defendant is admitted as an involuntary patient as a mentally ill person. There is no time limitation contained within s 33(1)(b) of the MHFPA for the assessment process. It may takes hours, days, weeks or even months. The only limitation contained in the section is found in s 33(2) which provides for the deemed dismissal of all charges subject to the order once a period of 6 months from the making of the order has lapsed.
	
	
	The legislative triggers to bring a person back before the Court after an order under s 33(1)(b) of the MHFPA and being assessed as not requiring to be detained or further detained in a mental health facility are s 33(1)(b) and s 32 (5) of the MHFPA. It is my opinion that there is no discretion to be exercised by either an authorised medical officer or a police officer in the circumstances outlined in the section.
	


Defendant’s Submissions


	
	The Defendant submits that the court has no jurisdiction to further deal with the matters on its own motion. In this matter, the court is dealing with the matters after the defendant has been arrested and appeared before the court. The Defendant further argues that the order made pursuant to s 33(1)(b) of the MHFPA is ‘final and not capable of giving rise to any further jurisdiction’.
	
	
	This submission, I find, is contrary to the legislation and in particular, is contradicted by the very words of s 33(1)(b), i.e., the defendant be brought back before a Magistrate or an authorised officer.
	
	
	Whilst the Defendant’s submissions argue that there was some ambiguity in relation to the interpretation of s 33(1)(b), I find that the section is clear in intention and operates in conjunction with the Mental Health Act.
	


Proceedings in the Central Local Court on 1 September 2015


	
	The discharge summary of St Vincent’s Hospital noting discharge on 31 August 2015 indicates that the Defendant, after 3 days, was ‘compliant with medication…was agreeable for discharge into Police custody…(was) now safe for discharge as she is no longer presenting any psychotic symptoms and does not present any suicidal ideation or risk to others.’
	
	
	A document dated 31 August 2015 under the hand of Dr Sarah Berger, Psychiatry Registrar, St Vincent’s Hospital was tendered in these proceedings. It states:
	


Katrina [Golding] was reviewed this morning by the treating psychiatry team including Dr Wilson, who felt she was not displaying any psychotic symptoms. She was polite, cooperative and logical with no obvious abnormal thought form or perceptions, but easily became angry and rude toward staff when demands not met. It is the view of the treating team that Katrina has presented with an episode of drug-induced psychosis which has now resolved. She is unable to be held under the Mental Health Act and is fit for discharge from the mental health ward at St Vincent’s Hospital as of 31/8/2015.


	
	The Defendant therefore came before the court on 1 September 2015 following discharge from St Vincent’s Hospital having been found not requiring detention or further detention in a facility pursuant to s 32(1) of the MHA.
	
	
	I find that it is clear that the Defendant was brought back before court pursuant to s 32 (5) of the MHA and s 33(1)(b) of the MHFPA. The Court was then empowered to deal further with the Defendant pursuant to s 33(2) and s.33 (3) as the period of 6 months had not elapsed. Had a period of 6 months elapsed, the charges could not be brought back before the court as they would have been taken to have been dismissed pursuant to s 33(2) of the MHFPA.
	


The Local Court Bench Book


	
	In the matter of R v Thomas Stafford Roberts (Lismore Local Court, 22 August 2014, unreported), his Honour Magistrate Heilpern referred to the Local Court Bench Book and its use as an important secondary source. In his decision, His Honour indicated:
	


… I have reluctantly concluded that the established practice outlined in the Bench Book is the appropriate practice in this case and in this course. There has been no intervention by the superior courts or parliament. The Bench Book represents highly persuasive material in an effort to ensure consistency in the court which deals with most criminal law matters in the State. It follows that my conclusion must be that I have no jurisdiction to relist the s.33 (1) (b) matters before me.


	
	In September 2015, the Bench Book chapters concerning the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 were rewritten. The Bench Book still retains its importance as secondary material. The new material provides, inter alia:
	


If an order is made under 33(1)(b) the outcome of the assessment will determine whether the proceedings continue at a later date. If after an assessment the defendant is found to be neither mentally ill person nor a mentally disordered person the police are required by the s 33(1)(b) order to apprehend the defendant under s 32(5) Mental Health Act 2007 and to take the defendant back to court. The original court papers can be relisted for the defendant to be dealt with further.


	
	This accords with my conclusions in this matter.
	


Conclusion


	
	I find that this Court has jurisdiction to further deal with these matters as the Defendant is lawfully before the Court pursuant to the operation of s 33(1)(b) of the MHFPA.

2768276,Tabbaa v DailyMail.com Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 166 912 465) [2015] NSWDC 278,"Judgment

The application before the court


	
	These are my reasons for ruling that imputation 3(a) (“the plaintiff is an evil person”) should be struck out pursuant to r 14.28 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) for reasons of form.
	
	
	The plaintiff commenced proceedings by way of statement of claim filed on 19 June 2015 for publication of an article in the Daily Mail Australia website. The contents of that publication are set out as an annexure to this judgment.
	
	
	The parties had discussions about the form and capacity of the imputations following the service of that pleading, which are relevant to the costs of this application. Those discussions, which did not include a challenge to the specific imputation in question, resulted in the filing of an amended statement of claim on 13 August 2015 setting out the following imputations:
	



	
	The plaintiff is an evil person (paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 6, 12, 13-15, 20-26, 31, 32, 41, 44, 50-52, 55 and 56).
	
	
	The plaintiff subjected his daughter to a violent and terrifying ordeal whilst she was trapped in Damascus (paragraph 1).
	
	
	The plaintiff is an awful man (paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 6, 12, 13-15, 20-26, 31, 32, 41, 44, 50-52, 55 and 56).
	
	
	[This imputation has been deleted in the Amended Statement of Claim.]
	
	
	The plaintiff forced his daughter to marry her cousin 15 years her senior (paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 44, 50-52, 55 and 56).
	
	
	The plaintiff subjected his wife to 20 years of violent marriage (paragraphs 1, 22 and 55).
	
	
	The plaintiff kidnapped his daughter (paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 44, 50-52, 55 and 56).
	
	
	[This imputation has been deleted in the Amended Statement of Claim.]
	
	
	[This imputation has been deleted in the Amended Statement of Claim.]
	
	
	The plaintiff forced his daughter to have a virginity test (paragraphs 1, 4, 13, 14, 22 and 23).
	
	
	The plaintiff beat his daughter at her auntie’s house (paragraph 22).
	
	
	The plaintiff is a violent and cruel man (paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 6, 12, 13-15, 20-26, 31, 32, 41, 44, 50-52, 55 and 56).
	
	
	[This imputation has been deleted in the Amended Statement of Claim.]
	


The nature of the dispute concerning the imputation


	
	Mr Rasmussen had agreed to remove an imputation that “the plaintiff is the most evil person that anyone would ever meet” (previously imputation 3(m)) and does not resile from that position, but submits that the word “evil” is of importance in relation to defamatory sting, and that the plaintiff should be entitled to incorporate it into an imputation. Mr Richardson submits that the word “evil”, like the word “corrupt” or the phrase “breach of trust”, has more than one meaning as well as failing to comply with the requirements of specificity.
	


The form and nature of the matter complained of


	
	The matter complained of is a publication on the defendant’s website consisting of photographs, a video and 47 paragraphs of text. The written part of the publication is essentially a summary of the contents of a 60 Minutes programme titled “Forced Marriage: An Extraordinary Story of Kidnap, Survival, Escape and Hiding”. The Daily Mail journalist, Sarah Dean, does not appear to have conducted any extra interviews or carried out any other researches; this is an article of the kind sometimes referred to as a “recap”, which simply reports a news story from another media source.
	
	
	The effect of this is that there are no statements of fact in the publication in these proceedings, which are inconsistent, different, or in addition to, the material on 60 Minutes. This is relevant because an imputation in very similar form (“That the plaintiff is an extremely evil person”) was struck out by McCallum J in Tabbaa v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 1114, on the basis that the meaning of an imputation that the plaintiff was evil (even “extremely evil”) was not sufficiently clear to enable the defendant to plead in answer to it and failed to meet the requirement of adequate specificity (at [22]-[23]):
	


“[22] In my view, the issue in the present case is similar to that considered in Drummoyne. This is not a case of a two-word billboard. In the context of this lengthy programme, the meaning of an imputation that the plaintiff is evil (even extremely evil) is not sufficiently clear to enable the defendant to plead in answer to it. As submitted by Mr Dawson, the matter complained of does contain substantially greater specification of the evil opened in the daughter’s remarks. Further, in my view, the existing imputations cover that field.

[23] The imputation in its present form is apt to generate confusion, both at the pleading stage and at the trial. By what measure should the defendant determine whether to plead truth to such an imputation? What documents would be discoverable in aid of a truth defence? Could the plaintiff be interrogated as to all aspects of his life? Without giving in to Manichaeism, could he meet the defence with evidence of his being good? In my view, the imputation fails to meet the requirement of adequate specificity and is liable to be struck out on that basis. Having regard to the scope of the existing imputations, I do not think the plaintiff should have leave to re-plead that imputation.”

The plaintiff’s three arguments


	
	Mr Rasmussen urged me to disregard both McCallum J’s reasoning and decision in limine, for the three reasons set out below.
	


A. The decision of McCallum J is not binding


	
	I accept that McCallum J’s judgment is not binding in terms of stare decisis principles, although considerations of comity must carry weight, especially where a judge of McCallum J’s expertise has considered the relevant principles.
	


B. The decision of McCallum J dealt with an entirely different, and shorter, publication


	
	This matter complained of, unlike the mater complained of in the proceedings before McCallum J, contains pictures only in the form of embedded images in what Mr Rasmussen called “a printed article”. However, I note that the publication on the website includes a link to a 2 minute 49 second video as well as the still photographs, so this statement is incorrect.
	
	
	I agree that there is far more detail in this publication than was the case in the proceedings based solely on the 60 Minutes broadcast which was the subject of consideration by McCallum J in Tabbaa v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (No 3). It is set out in writing, although accompanied by a short video extract from the programme, with headings and portions in bold, which would mean that the evanescent and transient nature of television programmes (Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158) does not apply. I agree that the format (but not the content) is different, but consider this supports the need for precision of the imputations, as opposed to the greater degree of flexibility for form and capacity of imputations where a publication is either very short or a television broadcast (Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden at [12]).
	


C. The principles applied by McCallum J do not apply to this publication


	
	Mr Rasmussen submitted that it was settled law for a plaintiff to be able to use the words of the matter complained of, that the objection was really a capacity objection and that there was no ambiguity or uncertainty in the word “evil”.
	
	
	It is not in dispute that, in appropriate cases (see for example, Mahommed v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 213 at [29] and Toben v Milne [2014] NSWCA 200 at [21]), a plaintiff may use a word or phrase from the matter complained of rather than rephrase what has been written or said.
	
	
	However, the issue is not resolved by accepting that the plaintiff is entitled to use the defendant’s own words. Even though I have accepted Mr Rasmussen’s submissions that there are differences in form in the matters complained of, I would still have arrived at the same conclusions as McCallum J in relation to this imputation as to the deficiencies in form of this imputation. The difficulty is that in the context of this lengthy article (even more lengthy than the 60 Minutes broadcast, some of which forms part of it), the meaning of an imputation that the plaintiff is evil is not sufficiently clear to enable the defendant to plead in answer to it.
	
	
	I am conscious, in this regard, that it is possible for certain of the readers not to have pressed the “play” button to play the video, or to activate the series of photographs, or even to read to the end of the article. The issue of how Internet publications are read (as opposed to more linear print publications) is a factor that courts may need to take into account in some internet publications (see the discussion of this issue by Dinika Roopani, “The scope and content of a ‘publication’ on the internet for the purposes of defamation law” (2015) MALR 33). However, this is not one of them. The written text includes large slabs of interviews given on 60 Minutes and the degree of similarity extends to the format of the presentation, ending with the statement by the plaintiff’s daughter at the end of the programme about how “evil” the plaintiff is.
	


Precision and ambiguity in meaning


	
	The first problem is the concept of “evil” which, like the concept of “breach of trust” in Singleton v Ffrench (1986) 5 NSWLR 425, is capable of a specialist meaning as well as the more general one of being a person warranting the decription “evil” for conduct of the kind attributed to the plaintiff in these proceedings.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen submitted that the plaintiff meant “evil” in the secular sense of the word. A person may be evil in the non-religious sense of the word (for example, the character “Dr Evil” in the Austin Powers film series). However, “evil” also has a particular connotation in terms of religious meaning which, having regard to the nature and context of the events described in the matter complained of (where the religious practices of one or more of the protagonists appears to be a factor), is capable of leading to ambiguity and confusion at the trial. This is because evidence of “evil” (or of “goodness” in reply, as to which see McCallum J in Tabbaa v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (No 3) at [23]) could relate to the conduct which is described, but as to whether it is “evil” in the religious sense.
	
	
	The religious flavour of “evil” is best demonstrated, not by a dictionary definition, but by the imputations of being “evil” pleaded in Falkenberg v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Levine J, 16 December 1994). The plaintiff sued over a Gary Larson “Far Side” cartoon of “Graffiti in Hell”, which depicted the devil writing graffiti consisting of:
	


“For a pleasant conversation call Satan 5551232""


	
	Imputations that the plaintiff was “evil” and “an evil fiend” were pleaded (the telephone number in question was the plaintiff’s telephone number). The matter complained of in those proceedings was struck out for unrelated reasons, but the use of “evil” in the imputations is telling.
	
	
	The second problem is that the degree of specificity required of a plaintiff when pleading an imputation must always be based upon the nature and extent of the publication in question, for the reasons explained by Gleeson CJ in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135 at 137.
	
	
	This is not a billboard containing a few words of the “X is disgusting” variety, but a lengthy article where the precise conduct is spelled out in considerable detail. There is no need for the plaintiff to take refuge behind the use of the word “evil” on the basis that there is no greater specificity in the matter complained of.
	
	
	This is a publication which is full of specificity, and the plaintiff’s avoidance of those specific imputations and preference for an umbrella term such as “evil” needs to be seen in that light.
	
	
	These are not objections based on capacity, but on the imprecise nature of the imputation and the ambiguity of the word “evil”. The plaintiff must identify the act or condition with sufficient precision for the defendant to know what to justify. Imputation 3(a) fails to do so and accordingly is struck out.
	


Should leave to replead this imputation, or a general leave, be granted?


	
	Mr Rasmussen sought leave to replead, which Mr Richardson opposed, although agreeing that an amended statement of claim identifying some of the unpleaded acts or conditions which could “fill in the gaps” left if this imputation is struck out.
	
	
	A difference between these proceedings and the proceedings before McCallum J is that the imputations here do not cover the field. The plaintiff is granted leave to file an amended statement of claim so that he may consider whether or not to plead imputations arising from the acts and conditions referred to by the plaintiff’s daughter when using the term “evil”. In Tabbaa v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (No 3), McCallum J noted the scope of the existing imputations as being a reason why the plaintiff should not be granted leave to replead (at [23]). Mr Richardson did not suggest that this was the case here.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen should not, however, take this as being an invitation to redraft this imputation to contain some epexegetic extension to the effect that the plaintiff is evil because of some act or condition. The plaintiff’s imputations need to come to terms with the meanings (i.e. the deep structure) of the publication.
	


Costs


	
	Mr Rasmussen submitted that the defendant should pay the plaintiff’s costs because Mr Richardson had not objected to this imputation in the amended statement of claim until after it had been pleaded, despite the availability of McCallum J’s judgment, which had been handed down a few days earlier.
	
	
	I do not see this delay as constituting any reason for varying the usual order that costs should follow the event.
	
	
	Accordingly, the plaintiff should pay the defendant’s costs of the argument.
	


Orders


	
	Imputation 3(a) is struck out.
	
	
	Plaintiff to pay the defendant’s costs of the argument today.
	
	
	Plaintiff to file and serve amended statement of claim in 14 days.
	
	
	Matter stood over to Thursday 10 December 2015 in the Defamation List.

			Ms Farrah, who grew up living in Sydney’s southwest and is the daughter of a Syrian Muslim and his Australian convert wife, was married off to her cousin who she had never met and endured terrible beatings after being taken to Syria’s capital Damascus from Egypt.
			
		
		
			
			12
			
			
			Her mother, who had previously fled Ms Farrah's father after 20 years of violent marriage, knew about her daughter's kidnapping but told her during phone calls from that she could not afford to bring her home to Australia.

			On arrival in Damascus, Ms Farrah was subjected to a virginity test because her father decided she had been under bad influences when in Year 7 at school, when she started smoking cigarettes and talking to boys.

			She felt 'confusion and fear' as nurses came and held her down. After the virginity test - despite the results showing she was indeed a virgin - her father and brother beat her at her Auntie’s house.

			'It’s quite a normal thing to kill your daughter for not being a virgin,' she noted.

		26 November 2015",2015-11-25 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768285,R v Alqudsi (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1783,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	Hamdi Alqudsi’s trial on indictment for seven counts contrary to s 7 of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 (Cth) (now repealed) is listed for hearing with a jury commencing on 2 February 2016.
	
	
	The first charge on the indictment is that the accused:
	


“Between about 25 June and 14 October 2013, at Sydney, in the State of NSW, did perform services for another person, namely Tyler Casey (also known as Abu Qaqa), with the intention of supporting or promoting the commission of an offence against section 6 of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978, being the entry by that person into a foreign State, namely Syria, with intent to engage in a hostile activity in Syria, in particular, engaging in armed hostilities in Syria.”


	
	The remaining charges are in similar terms save for the name of the person for whom services were allegedly provided. In the second charge such person was said to be Caner Temel (also known as Abu Moussa); in the third, Mehmet Biber (also known as Abu Abdul Malik); in the fourth, Muhammad Abdul-Karim Musleh (also known as Abu Hassan); in the fifth, Mahmoud Abed Aboshi (also known as Abu Alem); in the sixth, Amin Mohamed (also known as Abu Bilal); and in the seventh, Nassim Elbahsa.
	
	
	The Crown case against the accused is that between 25 June 2013 and 14 October 2013 he provided assistance to the seven named men, six of whom travelled to Syria to engage in armed hostilities against the Syrian government. The seventh was stopped by the authorities when he attempted to leave Australia. It is alleged that he helped the men by providing them both with instructions and support (which included measures to be taken to avoid detection by security officials) to travel from Australia to Syria via Turkey. It is also alleged that the accused acted as a conduit for information between the men and his contact in Syria, Mohommad Ali Baryalei.
	
	
	On 2 November 2015 I decided that the execution of the warrant at the accused’s residence in Revesby on 3 December 2013 was unlawful in that the officer who purported to be the executing officer had not been validly appointed: R v Alqudsi [2015] NSWSC 1615. The executing officer named in the warrant, Federal Agent (FA) Gategood, handed the warrant to FA Cole and instructed him to execute it but did not strike through his own name and insert the name of FA Cole. Instead, FA Cole, who noticed that the warrant still named FA Gategood as executing officer, struck through FA Gategood’s name and inserted his own. Both officers were present on the premises when the warrant was executed, although FA Cole purported to be the executing officer.
	
	
	Accordingly, the property seized in the course of the execution of the warrant was unlawfully obtained within the meaning of s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) for the reasons set out in R v Alqudsi [2015] NSWSC 1615 at [40]-[62].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence ought nonetheless be admitted under s 138. The accused opposed its admission.
	


Relevant legislation


	
	Section 138 of the Evidence Act relevantly provides:
	


138 Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence

(1) Evidence that was obtained:

(a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or

(b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law,

is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.

. . .

(3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:

(a) the probative value of the evidence, and

(b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and

(c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and

(d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and

(e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and

(f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and

(g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and

(h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.


	
	Section 3E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) makes provision for the issue of search warrants where there are reasonable grounds to suspect there will be evidence on premises. Section 3E(5) relevantly provides:
	


“(5) If an issuing officer issues a warrant, the officer is to state in the warrant:

(a) the offence to which the warrant relates; and

. . .

(d) the name of the constable who, unless he or she inserts the name of another constable in the warrant, is to be responsible for executing the warrant; and

. . .”


	
	Section 3E(5) was the provision that was breached when the warrant was executed.
	


Relevant principles


	
	The burden of satisfying the condition that the evidence has been improperly or unlawfully obtained is on the person seeking its exclusion. If this condition is established, the party seeking to adduce the evidence bears the burden of proving facts relevant to matters in favour of its admission: Parker v Comptroller-General of Customs [2009] HCA 7; 83 ALJR 494 at [28] per French CJ. For the reasons given in my earlier judgment, the accused has discharged the burden of proving that the evidence was unlawfully obtained.
	


Relevant considerations


	
	Although the range of factors relevant to my discretion under s 138 is not limited to the factors listed in s 138(3), these are mandatory relevant considerations. Accordingly, I propose to address each of these matters in turn. As the matters in s 138(3)(a) and (b) are the only factors that relate to the individual items of evidence, I propose to address the balance of the factors before turning to the particular items.
	


The nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding: s 138(3)(c)


	
	The relevant proceeding is the criminal trial by jury of the accused for seven counts against s 7. The offence is an offence against s 7 of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act, which is an indictable offence for which the maximum penalty is ten years’ imprisonment. Section 7 relevantly provides:
	


“Preparations for incursions into foreign States for purpose of engaging in hostile activities 

(1) A person shall not, whether within or outside Australia:

. . .

(e) give money or goods to, or perform services for, any other person or any body or association of persons with the intention of supporting or promoting the commission of an offence against section 6;

. . .

(1A) A reference in subsection (1) to the commission of an offence against section 6 is a reference to the doing of an act that would constitute, or would but for subsection 6(2) constitute, an offence against section 6.

(1B) A person shall not be taken to have committed an offence against this section merely because of doing an act by way of, or for the purposes of, the provision of aid of a humanitarian nature.

(2) A person shall not be taken to have committed an offence against this section in respect of the doing of an act outside Australia unless:

(a) at the time of the doing of that act, the person:

(i) was an Australian citizen; or

(ii) not being an Australian citizen, was ordinarily resident in Australia; or

(b) the person was present in Australia at any time before the doing of that act and, at any time when the person was so present, his or her presence was for a purpose connected with that act, or for purposes that included such a purpose.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years.”


	
	Section 6 of the Act provides:
	


“Incursions into foreign States with intention of engaging in hostile activities 

(1) A person shall not:

(a) enter a foreign State with intent to engage in a hostile activity in that foreign State; or

(b) engage in a hostile activity in a foreign State.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 20 years.

(2) A person shall not be taken to have committed an offence against this section unless:

(a) at the time of the doing of the act that is alleged to constitute the offence, the person:

(i) was an Australian citizen; or

(ii) not being an Australian citizen, was ordinarily resident in Australia; or

(b) the person was present in Australia at any time before the doing of that act and, at any time when the person was so present, his or her presence was for a purpose connected with that act, or for purposes that included such a purpose.

(3) For the purposes of subsection (1), engaging in a hostile activity in a foreign State consists of doing an act with the intention of achieving any one or more of the following objectives (whether or not such an objective is achieved):

(a) the overthrow by force or violence of the government of the foreign State or of a part of the foreign State;

(aa) engaging in armed hostilities in the foreign State;

(b) causing by force or violence the public in the foreign State to be in fear of suffering death or personal injury;

(c) causing the death of, or bodily injury to, a person who:

(i) is the head of state of the foreign State; or

(ii) holds, or performs any of the duties of, a public office of the foreign State or of a part of the foreign State; or

(d) unlawfully destroying or damaging any real or personal property belonging to the government of the foreign State or of a part of the foreign State.

(4) Nothing in this section applies to an act done by a person in the course of, and as part of, the person’s service in any capacity in or with:

(a) the armed forces of the government of a foreign State; or

(b) any other armed force in respect of which a declaration by the Minister under subsection 9(2) is in force.

(5) Paragraph (4)(a) does not apply if:

(a) a person enters a foreign State with intent to engage in a hostile activity in that foreign State while in or with an organisation; and

(b) the organisation is a prescribed organisation at the time of entry.

(6) Paragraph (4)(a) does not apply if:

(a) a person engages in a hostile activity in a foreign State while in or with an organisation; and

(b) the organisation is a prescribed organisation at the time when the person engages in that hostile activity.

(7) For the purposes of subsections (5) and (6), prescribed organisation means:

(a) an organisation that is prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph; or

(b) an organisation referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition of terrorist organisation in subsection 102.1(1) of the Criminal Code.

(8) Before the Governor-General makes a regulation prescribing an organisation for the purposes of paragraph (7)(a), the Minister must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering:

(a) a serious violation of human rights; or

(b) armed hostilities against the Commonwealth or a foreign State allied or associated with the Commonwealth; or

(c) a terrorist act (as defined in section 100.1 of the Criminal Code); or

(d) an act prejudicial to the security, defence or international relations of the Commonwealth.”


	
	Although the range of offending conduct covered by s 7 is wide and the maximum penalty is generally regarded as being reserved for the worst category of case, the maximum penalty is nonetheless an indication of the seriousness with which Parliament regards the offence: Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46; 163 CLR 447 at 451-452.
	


The gravity of the impropriety or contravention (s 138(3)(d)) and whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless (s 138(3)(e))


	
	The execution of the warrant would have been lawful had FA Gategood written FA Cole’s name on the warrant rather than leaving him to do it himself. FA Gategood intended to appoint FA Cole as the executing officer in his stead and instructed FA Cole that he was to be the executing officer. They were both present at the execution of the warrant. They had both received training with respect to the issuing and execution of warrants but had neither known nor understood the requirements of s 3E(5). Neither FA Gategood nor FA Cole was aware that the appointment of FA Cole as the executing officer had not been validly effected. Although FA Gategood was aware of the usual practice of the executing officer “signing over” the warrant in his or her own hand, he did not appreciate that this was what s 3E(5) of the Crimes Act required.
	
	
	The relevant illegality is an indication that whatever training they received was inadequate to impress on them the importance of compliance with s 3E. However, although there was formal non-compliance, FA Gategood actually intended that FA Cole execute the warrant as executing officer in his stead. The illegality was not deliberate. Nor am I satisfied that it was reckless.
	
	
	In these circumstances, I regard the gravity of the contravention as being relatively insubstantial.
	


Whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR): s 138(3)(f)


	
	Article 17 of the ICCPR provides:
	


“1. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.

2. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.”


	
	The execution of the warrant constituted an unlawful interference with the accused’s privacy, family and home. However, the illegality was so minimal that I do not regard this factor as adding much weight to the factors under s 138(3)((d) and (e), which cover the same subject matter.
	


Whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention: s 138(3)(g)


	
	The Crown does not suggest that any proceeding would be taken against FA Cole or FA Gategood (such as disciplinary proceedings). Indeed, the circumstances of the contravention are such that their ignorance of the legal requirement could well have been the result of inadequate training as to the importance of complying with the statutory procedures for appointing another executing officer.
	


The difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law: s 138(3)(h)


	
	There was no difficulty in obtaining the evidence without contravention of an Australian law. The accused submitted that there was, accordingly, no imperative that the evidence be obtained in that way, which had the effect of making the contravention more serious. I do not accept this submission. There would have been no contravention if FA Gategood had endorsed the warrant. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) obtained no advantage from the non-compliance. In these circumstances, although the difficulty of obtaining the evidence lawfully is a relevant factor, I regard it as a neutral one.
	


The probative value of the evidence (s 138(3)(a)) and the importance of the evidence in the proceeding (s 138(3)(b))


	
	It is apparent from the Defence Case Statement and subsequent documents filed that the accused intends to put the Crown to proof of all elements of the offence. There does not appear, at least from these documents, to be a positive defence case. No alternative hypothesis consistent with innocence has been articulated on behalf of the accused. Accordingly, all evidence which is relevant to the counts on the indictment as propounded in the Crown Case Statement is relevant to the trial of the accused.
	
	
	The Crown has identified from the items seized from the accused’s residence at Revesby the following items which will be considered in turn (by reference to their Property Seizure Record number). I propose to address the relevance of each item of evidence before engaging in the weighing exercise required by s 138(1).
	
	
	I note that the accused’s submissions as to relevance were substantially the same for each item. The accused submitted that there were other explanations for each item of evidence; that they could not necessarily be regarded as associated with the accused; and that it was “drawing a long bow” to suggest that any one item could establish the accused’s guilt of the offences charged.
	
	
	I propose to address this submission before turning to the individual items. The Crown case is a circumstantial one. The metaphor apparently first coined by Wigmore of “strands of a cable” (Wigmore on Evidence, vol 9 (Chadbourn rev. 1981) par.2497, pp 412-414) is apt: see Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 579 per Dawson J. Though any one strand of the cable may not be (and would indeed be unlikely to be) strong enough to prove the Crown case, many strands may be sufficient to prove a case beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, it is no answer to the asserted relevance of a document or photograph or other item that it is consistent with innocence as well as guilt, or that, taken by itself, it would not be enough to prove the Crown case.
	


HA009: Red covered notebook labeled “Things to Do CYC and Dawah Hamdi Alqudsi” (found inside a backpack inside a wardrobe)


	
	Various pages from the notebook have been identified on which are written lists of tasks and dates. The dates which are indicated are 21 August 2013 and 22 August 2013. The list for 21 August 2013 refers to travel from Sydney to Turkey, which, on the Crown case, is one of the routes taken by those referred to on the indictment. It also names three of the persons referred to in the indictment as being those for whom the accused is alleged to have performed services contrary to s 7 of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act: Abul Qaqa (count 1); Abu Moussa (count 2) and Abu Abdul Malik (count 3). There are also references to the need to obtain a further passport urgently.
	
	
	The probative value of the evidence appears to be high as it refers to travel to relevant countries in August 2013 and links the accused with three persons on the indictment. The document that refers to the need for a passport is also of significant probative value because it tends to indicate that the accused played a significant role in assisting those who wanted to travel. It may be relatively important to resolve ambiguities in what was said in intercepted telephone conversations. The entries in the notebook are contemporaneous with the events referred to in the indictment, which tend to suggest that the accused had a relevant motive or plan and had the knowledge or capacity to carry it out.
	


HA002: Piece of white paper (found inside a khaki-coloured bag inside a backpack inside wardrobe)


	
	This paper contains a record of a Turkish telephone number and a Syrian telephone number. The name of Abu Quaqa (who is named on the first count on the indictment) is also written on the paper. There is also the name, “Ahrar Al Sham”, which the Crown will submit is a Syrian insurgent organisation. This document tends to support the Crown case that the accused had contacts in both Turkey and Syria which he used to assist those named in the indictment to travel to Syria for the purposes of engaging in armed hostilities with an insurgent organisation there. Its probative value is significant. As with HA009, it is capable of suggesting that the accused had a relevant motive or plan and the knowledge or capacity to carry it out.
	


HA004: A4 piece of paper with colour photo of 9 men in black robes, each holding a rifle and one of whom is holding a flag (found inside a khaki-coloured bag inside a backpack inside wardrobe)


	
	This piece of paper is relied on by the Crown to prove that the accused has an interest in Islamist fighters. It tends to show that the accused had a motive to perform services for those who proposed to enter a foreign State (Syria) for the purpose of engaging in armed hostilities. The document has some probative value and may be important to show why the men (which other evidence might indicate were travelling to Turkey) were going there.
	


HA007: Letter from Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade addressed to Tyler Casey dated 10 September 2013 and its attachment (HA008) (found inside khaki-coloured bag inside a backpack inside wardrobe)


	
	The letter gave notice to Tyler Casey, also known as Abu Qaqa, (referred to in count 1 on the indictment) that the Minister had cancelled his passport on the grounds that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) suspected on reasonable grounds that if a passport were issued to him, he would be likely to engage in conduct that might prejudice the security of Australia or a foreign country. I accept the Crown’s submission that the document is relevant because the inference is available that this letter was in the accused’s possession because he was concerned about Mr Casey’s passport status. On the Crown case, the accused had assisted Mr Casey to travel to Syria via Turkey. The attachment, a document entitled “ASIO Security Assessment”, although separately marked (HA008), forms part of the document HA007 and derives its probative value, in part, from the document to which it was attached.
	


HA011: Print-outs of four photographs including two showing men holding weapons, two photographs of men alleged to be persons named in the indictment


	
	The Crown case is that two of the men in the photographs who are carrying weapons are Mehmet Biber and Caner Temel (who are persons named in the indictment). I consider that HA011 is potentially of significance because it may link the two men to the accused and also tends to suggest that the accused had a plan associated with their being involved in armed hostilities (as opposed, say, to humanitarian purposes).
	


HA016: documents found inside a plastic bag inside a suitcase in the backyard shed of the Revesby premises


	
	This item comprises seven documents which are relied on by the Crown to support the inference that the accused was interested in “jihad”. It is not necessary to extract from these documents the various statement that constitute a call to arms to Muslims to fight the jihad to expel infidels from Arab land. It is sufficient to note that the documents constitute tracts which encourage the readers to support armed conflict by either engaging in it or supporting those who participate in it. The distinction is drawn between “offensive jihad” where the enemy is attacked in its own terrirory and “defensive jihad” where the enemy is expelled from Muslim territory. These documents are relevant to motive and therefore have probative value in the Crown case to show the accused’s interest in martyrdom and jihad. They may also tend to establish the accused’s knowledge of what “martyrdom” and “mujajideen” mean when the speaker, whom the Crown says is the accused, uses the terms on the telephone in the intercepted conversations.
	


HA019: Brown and green spiral notebook found in the suitcase where the items that comprised HA016 were found


	
	This item is a notebook with Arabic words which, when translated, read “the poor slave of Allah: Hamdi Ibrahim Alqudsi My notes” on the front cover and “Hamdi Alqudsi” with a phone number on the back cover. There are “to do” lists at around the relevant time and an “agenda” which has, as item four: “Abul-qaqa & his wife”. Abulqaqa is named on the indictment (count 1) as a person to whom the accused provided services. The notebook is relevant because it is linked to the accused and tends to support a connection between the other items found in the shed (HA016) and the accused.
	


Whether the evidence ought be admitted under s 138


	
	Section 138 requires a weighing process to be undertaken to determine whether the desirability of admitting the evidence (taking into account such matters as the nature of the offence, the probative value of the evidence and its importance to the proceedings) outweighs the undesirability of admitting the evidence (having regard to the gravity of the contravention; whether it was deliberate, or reckless, as well as the difficulty of obtaining the evidence without impropriety).
	
	
	I consider the breach of the law by FA Gategood and FA Cole to be “innocent” in that it was neither deliberate nor reckless. The following passage from the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL (Bell and Howie JJ agreeing) from R v Camilleri [2007] NSWCC 36; 68 NSWLR 720 at [35] is, in my view, apposite:
	


“This case is to be distinguished from a situation where evidence is obtained by police in knowing breach of the law or, where they may be reckless as to whether or not it has been lawfully obtained. Where the breach of the law is innocent, and the alleged offence serious there must be powerful countervailing considerations before the evidence should be rejected. The fact that the evidence is of high probative value will weigh in favour of its admission.”


	
	As I understand the Crown case against the accused (as revealed in the Crown Case Statement), it is substantially based on communications which were recorded as a result of telephone intercepts, which I have found to be lawful: R v Alqudsi [2015] NSWSC 1615 at [21]-[28]. Each of the items obtained as a result of the execution of the search warrant at the accused’s premises at Revesby which is referred to above is significant and has some probative value in the context of what is alleged to have been communicated in the recorded exchanges. The relevance and probative value of each item has been identified above. In general terms, the relevance of each item is either to connect the accused to the persons named in the indictment who left Australia, or attempted to do so; to indicate the religious or philosophical motive that the accused might have had to perform the services which the Crown alleges that he provided to those persons; or to show that he was capable of assisting those persons to travel to Turkey and on to Syria through Hatay because of his contacts in Turkey and Syria.
	


Conclusion


	
	The serious nature of the offences and the probative value and relative importance of the evidence are powerful factors in favour of its admission under s 138. The illegality, which was neither deliberate nor reckless, was relatively trivial. The act that made the execution of the warrant illegal (that it was endorsed by FA Cole instead of FA Gategood) made no difference to whether the evidence could be obtained and gave the AFP no advantage. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the desirability of admitting each of the items relied on by the Crown which is listed above, substantially outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that was obtained in circumstances which involved technical non-compliance with a statutory provision.
	
	
	I note that the argument was confined to the admissibility of the evidence under s 138. I have not heard any other objections to the evidence and, accordingly, have determined only that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of so doing pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	I note for completeness that there were several computer files located on a computer in the accused’s residence at Revesby, which contained items of a similar ilk to those documents which comprised HA016. The Crown did not seek a determination of their admissibility under s 138 as it has not yet determined which of the document it proposes to tender in its case.

2768290,Glover v R [2015] NSWCCA 293,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Button J.
	
	
	BUTTON J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon Laurence Kwadjo Glover (the applicant) by Acting Judge Phegan in the District Court of New South Wales on 26 August 2014. The single ground of appeal asserts that the sentence imposed upon the applicant demonstrates erroneous disparity when compared with the sentence imposed by his Honour on the same occasion upon Paul Christopher Geeves (the co-offender).
	


Background


	
	The background to the imposition of sentence may be shortly stated. The applicant and the co-offender stood trial jointly, each having been arraigned on a count of conspiring to commit an act with intent to pervert the course of justice. The dates within which it was averred that the conspiracy was on foot were from 2 February 2010 until 21 July 2010.
	
	
	The substantive offence of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice is contained in s 319 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). It carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years, and has no standard non-parole period. In the absence of a statutory offence of conspiracy to commit a particular offence (for example, conspiracy to murder, pursuant to s 26 of the Crimes Act), a conspiracy to commit an offence against the law of New South Wales is a common law offence, the maximum penalty of which is at large. It is well established, however, that it would only be in rare cases that a sentence for a conspiracy to commit a substantive statutory offence would be greater than the maximum penalty applicable to that substantive offence.
	
	
	At the end of the trial, the jury returned verdicts of guilty against both men (a verdict on an alternative count was not taken, and it need not be discussed further).
	


The offence


	
	It is appropriate to state the objective features of the offending very succinctly. That is because his Honour drew no real distinction between the two men in that regard, and that approach at first instance is not impugned in this application.
	
	
	In short, in 2009 the brother of the applicant had been charged with a number of armed robberies, and was refused bail. Whilst he was in custody, and at his request, both the applicant and the co-offender threatened a man who was to be a witness against the brother of the applicant in an effort to have him change the version of events that he had given to the police. Instead, the witness alerted the police, and an investigation was commenced into the conspiracy. In the remarks on sentence, his Honour rejected the proposition that either offender had believed that he was merely assisting an innocent man by pressuring a dishonest person to tell the truth. His Honour also found that there were some threats of violence made that were “very real and direct”.
	


Subjective features of the applicant


	
	In the proceedings on sentence, no evidence was tendered on behalf of the applicant that revealed anything of his life history or personality. That meant that only two pieces of evidence about subjective matters were placed before his Honour in the proceedings on sentence: the criminal record of the applicant, and a pre-sentence report (PSR), each of which was tendered by the Crown.
	


Criminal record of the applicant


	
	The criminal record of the applicant showed that he was born in June 1987, and accordingly was aged 27 years as at the date of sentence. It also showed the following.
	
	
	In June 2003, the applicant drove unlicensed, and was fined.
	
	
	Later in the same month, whilst a learner driver, he refused to produce his licence, failed to display L plates, and was a learner driver unaccompanied by a licensed driver. Again, for those offences he was fined.
	
	
	In November 2004, he was placed on two bonds by the Children’s Court for offences of possessing housebreaking implements and carrying a cutting weapon (a foreshadowed submission to this Court that it was contrary to ss 14 and 15 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) for the sentencing judge to receive evidence of the Children’s Court matters in the proceedings on sentence was abandoned at the hearing). Subsequently, in September 2005, those two bonds were called up, but each call-up was dismissed by way of a caution only.
	
	
	Later in November 2004, he was placed on probation for 18 months by the Children’s Court for an offence of possessing implements with which he could enter or drive a motor vehicle. Again, that probation was called up in September 2005, and again the call-up was dismissed by way of a caution only.
	
	
	On 3 February 2014 (that is, well after the commission of the conspiracy, but some months before he was sentenced for it) in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney, the applicant was sentenced for nine counts of robbery in company whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. It seems that the first of those offences was committed on 4 May 2011. He received an aggregate head sentence of imprisonment of 11 years six months to commence on 12 September 2011 and conclude on 11 March 2023, with an aggregate non-parole period of 7 years 2 months to commence on 12 September 2011 and conclude on 11 November 2018.
	


Pre-sentence report about the applicant


	
	The PSR was dated 15 August 2014. It focused very much on the progress of the applicant in custody whilst serving his sentence for the armed robberies.
	
	
	With regard to the upbringing and background of the applicant, it simply stated that he was a single man who was living in the inner west of Sydney with his mother before his incarceration. It recorded that the applicant had left school in year 10, after having been expelled for fighting. He had had periods of short-term casual employment, along with periods of unemployment.
	
	
	The PSR stated that the applicant accepted that he had become involved with friends of his brother who were “antisocial”.
	
	
	The applicant expressed his remorse to the author about the conspiracy, and his mother reported that the attitude of the applicant had changed for the better, and the applicant had “learned his lesson”.
	
	
	The applicant told the author of the report that he accepted that he had had a problem with prohibited drugs and alcohol at the time of the commission of the offence. His position was that he had been able to stay free of both since being incarcerated. He had tried to get help with his drug problem in custody, but had been told that his release date was too far away for him to enrol in a particular course.
	
	
	Whilst in custody, the applicant had been dealt with for five offences against prison discipline. Three of them involved the use of physical violence; another related to failing to supply a sample for drug testing. There had also been an incident in which the applicant had set fire to his own cell, because he felt that his concerns about an event in the prison were not being adequately addressed by the authorities.
	
	
	As I have said, those two documents were the extent of the subjective evidence pertaining to the applicant placed before his Honour in the proceedings on sentence.
	


Subjective features of the co-offender 


	
	The absence of evidence provided to his Honour on behalf of the applicant was in stark contrast to the evidence tendered on behalf of the co-offender. A great deal of documentary material was tendered on his behalf. It included: a psychological report; documents pertaining to the co-offender’s automotive repair business; the co-offender’s curriculum vitae; 12 character references from a variety of sources, including immediate family members and business associates; a letter of apology written by the co-offender; and a medical report relating to the health of his mother. As well as that, the co-offender gave evidence on oath.
	
	
	I turn now to summarise the subjective findings of his Honour about the co-offender, who is five years older than the applicant.
	
	
	His Honour found that he was very remorseful.
	
	
	He had no criminal record whatsoever, whether before or after the commission of the offence.
	
	
	He had been subject to reasonably onerous bail conditions for quite some time before the trial.
	
	
	The co-offender had also spent 17 days in custody after bail was refused, an experience that his Honour found was “relatively short, but nonetheless very salutary”.
	
	
	He had sound educational and employment histories; indeed, he had been running a successful family business with his brother.
	
	
	In 2013, the co-offender had been stabbed and robbed at gunpoint, and developed post-traumatic stress disorder as a result.
	
	
	Separately, his mother had been disabled by a stroke, and she depended on the co-offender and his brother for her care.
	
	
	Finally, his Honour found that the co-offender was unlikely to reoffend, and had good prospects of rehabilitation. In fact, with regard to the latter, his Honour remarked that it was “difficult to know what he is being rehabilitated from”, on the basis that the applicant had led a “perfectly law abiding and socially responsible life” before involving himself in the conspiracy.
	


Aspects of the remarks on sentence


	
	In discussing the objective features of the offence, his Honour spoke of an initial informal “starting point” of a head sentence of three years with regard to both offenders. In light of the lack of favourable subjective material placed before him, his Honour was content to impose that head sentence upon the applicant, and to maintain the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence. That led to a non-parole period of two years three months.
	
	
	However, that sentence was expressed to commence on 12 November 2017, with the head sentence expiring in its entirety on 11 November 2020, and the non-parole period expiring on 11 February 2020. Bearing in mind that the pre-existing aggregate non-parole period of the applicant expired on 11 November 2018, it can be seen that the practical effect of the imposition of the sentence by the learned sentencing judge was no extension of the pre-existing head sentence, and an extension of the pre-existing non-parole period by one year three months.
	
	
	In the case of the co-offender, his Honour expressed the view that the powerful subjective features should lead to a head sentence of no more than 18 months. Subsequently, his Honour considered the option of an intensive correction order, but ultimately rejected it in favour of a suspended sentence of eighteen months’ duration.
	
	
	In short, the sentencing judge was quite aware of the differentiation in the sentences that he was imposing upon the two offenders, and gave detailed reasons for that differentiation by way of his Honour’s findings about subjective matters.
	


Ground of appeal


	
	A single ground of appeal was notified and pressed:
	


The applicant suffers a justifiable case of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed upon him with the sentence imposed upon his co-offender, Mr Paul Christopher Greeves.

Submissions of the applicant


	
	In oral submissions, counsel for the applicant accepted that it was quite open to his Honour to draw a distinction between the applicant and the co-offender in their sentences, bearing in mind the equivalence of the objective features, and the differentiation in the subjective features. With appropriate conciseness, he simply submitted that the difference in the sentences actually imposed – not only in terms of length, but also in terms of the mode of their service – went beyond appropriate reflection of the differences in the subjective features.
	
	
	In particular, he submitted that it could not be within the sentencing discretion that two men of roughly the same age; who committed the same offence; in the same way; and each of whom was found guilty at the end of a joint trial; ended up with sentences whereby the length of the sentence imposed on one of them was precisely double the length of the sentence imposed upon the other.
	
	
	In short, he submitted that erroneous disparity was demonstrated when one considers all of the findings of his Honour, and that there should be some adjustment by this Court of the sentence imposed upon the applicant.
	
	
	As an ancillary matter, he noted that the applicant had also appealed against at least some of the convictions for armed robbery that underpinned the pre-existing aggregate sentence. We were informed at the hearing that judgment in that appeal was reserved by another bench of this Court. The position of counsel was that, if the pre-existing aggregate sentence were altered, then there should be a commensurate alteration of the commencement date of the sentence for the conspiracy, pursuant to s 59 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).
	


Determination


	
	I consider that the resolution of this matter can be concise as well. To my mind, there were ample bases upon which it was open to the sentencing judge to draw a sharp distinction between the sentence to be imposed upon the applicant and the sentence to be imposed upon the co-offender. And I do not consider that the distinction ultimately drawn by his Honour is so sharp as to be beyond the legitimate bounds of the exercise of the sentencing discretion in the circumstances of this case. In particular, I do not consider that there is any basis upon which the applicant, when comparing his sentence with the sentence of the co-offender, could experience (objectively speaking) a justifiable sense of grievance: see Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [105] (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ).
	
	
	There were inevitable contrasts to be drawn between the applicant and the co-offender with regard to many matters. They were: their prior criminality as at the date of sentence (extremely grave in the case of the applicant, non-existent in the case of the co-offender); their educational and work records (poor in the case of the applicant, very sound in the case of the co-offender); the evidence from others about their character (non-existent in the case of the applicant, fulsome in the case of the co-offender); the effect of incarceration upon them (unimpressive – on the evidence of the offences against prison discipline – in the case of the applicant, very salutary in the case of the co-offender); their family circumstances; their emotional health; their prospects of reoffending; and, finally, their prospects of rehabilitation generally.
	
	
	The combined effect of those matters formed a sound basis upon which it was open to his Honour to impose upon the applicant a short sentence of imprisonment that in reality extended his period of mandatory incarceration by no more than one year three months, and to impose upon the co-offender a reasonably short suspended sentence.
	
	
	In short, I do not consider that the applicant has established erroneous disparity between the sentence imposed upon himself and the sentence imposed upon the co-offender. To the contrary, I consider that the differentiation in the sentences imposed was well within the discretion reposed in the sentencing judge.
	
	
	Finally, this Court recently resolved the pending appeal with regard to the convictions underpinning the aggregate sentence by dismissing it: see Glover v R; Stuart v R [2015] NSWCCA 285. In those circumstances, there is no occasion for the adjustment of the sentence imposed for the conspiracy.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal against sentence granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	FAGAN J: I agree with Button J.

2768291,Lago v R [2015] NSWCCA 296,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: The applicant, Michael Lago, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court at Parramatta by Payne DCJ on 18 December 2014 for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, namely, 55.6 grams of methylamphetamine, contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	The offence occurred on 10 April 2013. The applicant entered a plea of not guilty. After an eight day trial the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the supply charge and the applicant was convicted on 1 September 2014.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 15 years, a $220,000 fine, or both: s 32(1). No standard non-parole period is prescribed.
	
	
	Her Honour imposed a sentence of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months to date from 31 August 2014 and to expire on 28 February 2017.
	


Relevant facts


	
	The applicant did not give evidence during the trial or the proceedings on sentence. The following summary is taken from her Honour’s findings on sentence, which were not challenged on appeal except in one respect. This concerned the respective roles of the applicant and a co-offender.
	
	
	In early April 2013, telephone intercepts and surveillance conducted by the police revealed that Mr David Scott requested the applicant to provide two ounces of the drug saying that he would “like to catch up with your mate for a game of pool or two”. Evidence was given at trial that this was consistent with a code for drugs.
	
	
	Money or “paperwork” was provided prior to the delivery of the drugs. The payment for the drugs was made on 8 April 2013 when the applicant met Mr Scott at Ballina Depot. (Mr Scott was an interstate truck driver.) A telephone conversation between the applicant and Mr Scott was intercepted, in which Mr Scott said “You take your bit out and that way a few expenses are covered”. The judge accepted that this conversation described the applicant taking for himself some of that money.
	
	
	On 10 April 2013 the applicant supplied the methylamphetamine to Mr Scott at around 10.40 am on Roberts Road, Eastern Creek. Mr Scott then concealed the drugs inside an area near the landing legs of the first trailer of his Kenworth B-double truck, which was parked at the side of the road. A short time after the applicant left the scene, police located the drugs in Mr Scott’s truck.
	
	
	The quantity of drugs supplied (55.6 grams) is a little over ten times the indictable quantity, the indictable quantity being 5 grams and the traffickable quantity being 3 grams. The “traffickable quantity” and “indictable quantity” of a prohibited drug, including methylamphetamine, are set out in columns 1 and 3 of Schedule 1 to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.
	
	
	The purity of the methylamphetamine supplied by the applicant was 7.5%. The evidence was that this was consistent with a street level of purity for that kind of drug and the drugs would be expected to be consumed at that level of purity. There was also evidence that the value of methylamphetamine depends on a variety of factors and that an ounce of methylamphetamine could cost between $7,000 and $13,500.
	
	
	Both the applicant and Mr Scott were arrested on 10 April 2013.
	
	
	There was evidence at trial of an earlier drug supply transaction in which the applicant supplied the same prohibited drug, ice or methylamphetamine, to Mr Scott on 30 January 2013. The quantity of the drug and the price was unknown. Evidence of this transaction had been allowed at the trial as tendency evidence following a pre-trial ruling by the judge.
	


The co-offender’s sentence


	
	On 22 May 2014, Mr Scott together with his wife, Susan Scott, were sentenced in the District Court at Lismore, having pleaded guilty to a number of offences. After a discount of 25% for the guilty pleas, the sentences of imprisonment imposed on Mr Scott were as follows:
	



	
		
			
			Take part in the supply of methylamphetamine on 10 April 2013
			
			
			3 years 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 9 months
			
		
		
			
			Supply methylamphetamine between 24 January 2013 and 10 April 2013 (on 30 occasions)
			
			
			3 years 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 9 months
			
		
		
			
			Deal with proceeds of crime
			
			
			Fixed term of 6 months
			
		
		
			
			Supply methylamphetamine (2.84 grams) on 10 April 2013
			
			
			Fixed term of 6 months
			
		
		
			
			Breach of s 9 bond
			
			
			Fixed term of 9 months
			
		
	



	
	The sentences imposed on Mr Scott were substantially concurrent. The sentence for breach of the s 9 bond was to date from 10 April 2013 and the other sentences were to date from 10 July 2013.
	


The applicant’s subjective case


	
	The applicant was aged 41 at the time of the offence and aged 42 at the time of sentence. He left school in year 9. The presentence report from Community Corrections described the applicant’s highly dysfunctional upbringing, marred by his father’s alcoholism and domestic violence.
	
	
	The applicant worked in a number of labouring type jobs prior to a serious motorbike accident in 2002. He was the victim of a stabbing attack at a McDonald’s restaurant sometime between 2002-2003.
	
	
	Following the stabbing incident and the injuries sustained from several motorbike accidents, the applicant was placed on a disability support pension in 2004 and has been unemployed since that time.
	
	
	The applicant has two children aged 22 and 14 years at the time of sentence. He was in a stable relationship with his current partner of five years at the time of sentence.
	
	
	Dr Furst diagnosed the applicant as having the following mental disorders: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); chronic pain disorder; and cannabis abuse.
	
	
	The applicant was undergoing psychiatric and psychological care prior to the offence for his emotional problems, anxiety and depression. Dr Furst considered that these factors and the applicant’s underlying PTSD and medical problems were likely to make a custodial sentence weigh more heavily on the applicant than the average inmate.
	
	
	The presentence report by Community Corrections recorded that the applicant agreed with the facts as presented by the police but would not elaborate further other than stating “a mate asked me to help him out, I initially refused and arranged for someone else to drop off the drugs, but that fell through so I did it and got caught”.
	
	
	The psychiatric report recorded that the applicant had given a similar explanation to Dr Furst. The applicant claimed that “It was the only time. I didn’t mean to do it.”
	
	
	The applicant had previously been sentenced to a 2 year good behaviour bond in the District Court at Penrith on 20 June 2008 for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, being an indictable quantity (not cannabis). The applicant had also asked on that occasion that three further matters on a Form 1 be taken into account by the Court on sentence pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), namely, offences involving goods in custody; possession of equipment for administering prohibited drugs; and possession of a prohibited weapon.
	


The judge’s reasons


	
	With respect to the subject offence, her Honour found that the drug was obtained by the applicant from a person unknown and provided to Mr Scott whom the applicant knew was an interstate truck driver and also knew that he at least was consuming the drug whilst he was continuing to drive.
	
	
	Her Honour rejected the applicant’s account given to Community Corrections, that in delivering the drugs to Mr Scott he was just helping out a mate who had asked him to drop off the drugs. Her Honour also rejected the applicant’s account to similar effect given to Dr Furst. Her Honour found that clearly it was not the only time the applicant had supplied a prohibited drug, and that the applicant’s explanation was not consistent with the content of the telephone intercepts.
	
	
	With respect to the evidence of the earlier drug supply on 30 January 2013, her Honour found, beyond reasonable doubt, that the applicant supplied ice or methylamphetamine to Mr Scott on that date, although the quantity and the price paid were unknown. Her Honour continued (at ROS 3-4):
	


In any event, the relevance of that I accept is that, as the Crown said, and indeed defence counsel submitted, the Crown submitted I would find beyond reasonable doubt the supply which I have said I have and that I can use that evidence when determining the level of involvement that the prisoner had in a drug supply network and in finding that the supply on 10 April 2013 was not an isolated incident.


	
	Her Honour found that the subject offence could not be regarded as an isolated occurrence, or conduct that is out of character for the applicant, noting that the applicant’s counsel had acknowledged that neither proposition was advanced on behalf of the applicant. Nonetheless, her Honour accepted the submission of the applicant’s counsel that the earlier drug supply did not reflect any greater involvement of the applicant in the drug supply network.
	
	
	Her Honour found that the applicant had engaged in the offending on a commercial basis rather than a social basis. The judge found that the applicant had obtained some financial gain but was unable to quantify the gain.
	
	
	Her Honour observed that the applicant and Mr Scott had different roles in terms of the drug supply. The judge continued (ROS 7):
	


Mr Scott clearly had a considerable number of customers or a number of customers and he was at a lower level than Mr Lago, and I say “lower” because he is one step down, and Mr Lago was closer to the original dealer. But it is very difficult to classify which person is more serious or less serious because each play a role.


	
	Her Honour found that the offending was an objectively serious example of the drug supply offence given:
	


the amount of the drug, and that it was not an isolated occasion, and that [the applicant] was above Mr Scott in the chain, not that I am saying this is the only consideration, but I do accept that it is so... (ROS 7-8)


	
	Her Honour referred to the need for general deterrence and the fact that the applicant must have well known that some of the recipients of the drug were going to be interstate truck drivers.
	
	
	Her Honour then turned to the issue of parity between the applicant and Mr Scott. The judge noted that the starting point for Mr Scott’s sentence for taking part in supply of methylamphetamine on 10 April 2013 was 5 years, taking into account the 25% discount for his guilty plea. Her Honour also noted that Mr Scott was sentenced for other offences to which he had pleaded guilty as indicated above. Her Honour referred to relevant differences between the applicant and Mr Scott including: that there was no finding of special circumstances with respect to Mr Scott; and that Mr Scott was also on a s 9 bond for 2 years and a further bond for a number of drug related offences at the time of his offending.
	
	
	Her Honour referred to the applicant’s prior criminal history, in particular his conviction on a drug supply offence in June 2008.
	
	
	Her Honour referred to the applicant’s subjective circumstances outlined in the presentence report and the psychiatrist’s report and to his health problems (which pre-dated the offending) which was making his time in prison more difficult. Her Honour accepted that a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily on the applicant than perhaps another inmate.
	
	
	Her Honour was guarded as to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation, and accepted that he had some prospects for rehabilitation.
	
	
	Her Honour found special circumstances in light of the medical evidence concerning the applicant’s depressive condition and other disorders. Her Honour then proceeded to impose the sentence already indicated, with the non-parole period being 62.5% of the head sentence.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence on three proposed grounds. Grounds 1 and 2 are related and may be considered together.
	


Ground 1: The Court erred in law by finding beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was criminally responsible for a non-charged previous discrete offence of supplying methylamphetamine on 30 January 2013

Ground 2: The Court erred in law by taking into account as a circumstance of aggravation the uncharged offence of supplying methylamphetamine on 30 January 2013


	
	Ground 1 asserts that there was an irregularity in the sentencing process because the sentencing judge had made a finding with respect to uncharged conduct, namely the supply of methylamphetamine by the applicant to Mr Scott on 30 January 2013. The complaint is that her Honour made a finding of guilt on an offence which had not been charged on indictment and not prosecuted in accordance with the mandatory requirements of Ch 3, Pt 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).
	
	
	Ground 2 draws on ground 1 and asserts that the sentencing judge used her finding concerning the uncharged conduct as a circumstance of aggravation for the subject offence. It was contended that the applicant was punished for an earlier offence in respect of which he had not been convicted and sentenced, contrary to the principle in The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383 (De Simoni).
	


De Simoni principle


	
	In De Simoni, Gibbs CJ (Mason and Murphy JJ agreeing) explained at 389:
	


… the general principle that the sentence imposed on an offender should take account of all the circumstances of the offence is subject to a more fundamental and important principle, that no one should be punished for an offence of which he has not been convicted ... The combined effect of the two principles, so far as is relevant for present purposes, is that a judge, in imposing sentence is entitled to consider all the conduct of the accused, including that which would aggravate the offence, but cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence.


	
	The De Simoni principle is breached only if the offender is actually punished for the conduct constituting the uncharged offence or aggravating circumstance. Accordingly, “[a]n assessment whether a breach of the R v De Simoni principle has occurred ought involve consideration of the substance of what was said, in the context of the case, and not merely the form of words used”: SBF v R [2009] NSWCCA 231; 198 A Crim R 219 at [128] (Johnson J; Spigelman CJ and McClellan CJ at CL agreeing).
	


Decision


	
	In my view, the applicant’s contentions are misconceived.
	
	
	First, the judge did not make a finding leading to a conviction in respect of the applicant’s uncharged conduct on 30 January 2013. In oral argument, counsel for the applicant ultimately accepted so much.
	
	
	Secondly, it might be thought, in light of the concessions by the applicant’s counsel, that the applicant accepted on the sentencing hearing that he was involved in the earlier drug supply on 30 January 2013. However, consistently with The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [27], the sentencing judge took the approach that she could not take facts into account in a way that was adverse to the interests of the applicant unless those facts had been established beyond reasonable doubt. The judge was so satisfied.
	
	
	The real issue is whether the judge’s finding relating to the uncharged conduct was used in a manner contrary to the principle in De Simoni.
	
	
	Her Honour was careful not to treat the finding in relation to the uncharged conduct as an aggravating factor. She expressly stated the particular relevance and limited use of the applicant’s earlier conduct on sentence.
	
	
	First, her Honour relied upon the earlier conduct to find that the subject offence was not an isolated offence. It is entirely orthodox for the sentencing judge to admit context evidence to displace a submission that the offences were single, isolated events: Peiris v R [2014] NSWCCA 58 at [64] (Leeming JA; Button J and R S Hulme AJ agreeing). That is what her Honour expressly said she was doing in the passage in her remarks on sentence extracted at [26] above.
	
	
	Next and related to the first matter, her Honour relied upon the earlier conduct when rejecting the applicant’s assertions recorded in the presentence report and the psychiatrist’s report, that he was only delivering the drugs for a mate, and “It was the only time. I didn’t mean to do it”. Evidence may be used “to assess the veracity and reliability of the applicant … not … as a circumstance of aggravation to be taken into account when sentencing the applicant”: Sills v R [2011] NSWCCA 271 at [57] (Hoeben J; Meagher JA and Rothman J agreeing).
	
	
	Finally, her Honour also used the earlier conduct as informing the seriousness of the subject offence (in what was not an isolated offence), as the passage in her remarks on sentence extracted at [30] above demonstrates. There is no breach of the De Simoni principle when the uncharged conduct is used to inform the seriousness of an offence for which the offender is to be sentenced. As Basten JA explained (Hulme and Latham JJ agreeing) in Einfeld v R [2010] NSWCCA 87; 200 A Crim R 1 at [146]:
	


a course of unlawful conduct may well give rise to a number of possible charges. If the prosecution proceeds on one count only, it does not follow that the surrounding conduct cannot be taken into account in sentencing. The surrounding conduct cannot give rise to a more serious offence, but it can demonstrate the degree of seriousness with which the charged offence should be viewed.


	
	For these reasons, the approach taken by her Honour did not breach the De Simoni principle.
	
	
	Grounds 1 and 2 are not made out.
	


Ground 3: The Court erred by finding that the offender David Scott was at a lower level of objective criminality than the applicant and thereby the sentence imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive


	
	Although expressed as a complaint that the applicant’s sentence is manifestly excessive, in oral argument counsel for the applicant confirmed that the essential complaint is that there is an erroneous disparity between sentences imposed on the applicant and his co-offender, Mr Scott.
	
	
	As already mentioned, Mr Scott pleaded guilty to a number of drug (methylamphetamine) supply and related charges and was sentenced by Wells SC DCJ on 22 May 2014 in the District Court at Lismore. This was prior to the commencement of the applicant’s trial, following his plea of not guilty, on 21 August 2014. The remarks on sentence of Wells DCJ were before her Honour.
	


The parity principle


	
	The relevant principles are well known and are conveniently summarised by Johnson J (McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J agreeing) in Rae v R [2011] NSWCCA 211 at [59]-[63]. For the purposes of this appeal it is sufficient to note the following.
	
	
	The “parity principle” requires that like offenders should be treated in a like manner. Accordingly the principle allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances: Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 (Green) at [28] (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ).
	
	
	The test for determining whether there is a justifiable sense of grievance is objective: Green at [31]. The question is whether a reasonable mind looking overall at what has happened would see that the applicant’s grievance is justified: R v Wei Pan [2005] NSWCCA 114 at [34]; Dwayhi v R; Bechara v R [2011] NSWCCA 67; 205 A Crim R 274 (Dwayhi) at [21].
	
	
	What is required to be shown is a marked disparity between sentences giving rise to the appearance of injustice because one offender has been unfairly treated having regard to the sentence passed upon the other offender: Green at [31]-[32]. Other descriptors of what is required include gross, glaring or manifest disparity: England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [61]-[67]; Dwayhi at [24].
	
	
	It is also necessary to keep in mind that it is the sentence imposed upon a co-offender which is said to give rise to a sense of injustice, not the sentence imposed upon the offender: Lewins v R [2007] NSWCCA 189; 175 A Crim R 40 at [7]; Dwayhi at [26].
	


Decision


	
	In the present case, the applicant points to the difference between the sentence of 4 years imposed on the applicant and that of 3 years 9 months imposed on Mr Scott, and contends that her Honour found that Mr Scott was at a lower level of objective criminality, when the contrary should have been found.
	
	
	There are two difficulties with this argument. The first is that it does not involve a comparison of like sentences because it ignores Mr Scott’s guilty plea. As her Honour correctly observed, the notional starting point of Mr Scott’s sentence on the offence of taking part in the drug supply on 10 April 2013 was 5 years imprisonment. The differentiation of 3 months in the head sentences in favour of the co-offender is readily explained by the 25% discount for the co-offender’s guilty plea.
	
	
	The second difficulty is that the applicant’s argument misstates her Honour’s finding as to the part played by each of the applicant and Mr Scott in the offending. What her Honour found was that the applicant and Mr Scott had different roles in terms of the supply of prohibited drugs on 10 April 2013. Although she described Mr Scott as being at a “lower” level than the applicant, her Honour was careful to explain what she meant by this characterisation. As the passage in her Honour’s remarks on sentence (extracted at [29] above) makes clear, the judge was referring to Mr Scott being one step down in the chain of supply (Mr Scott having a considerable number of customers) and the applicant being closer to the original dealer.
	
	
	Further, her Honour expressly acknowledged that it was very difficult to determine which person’s offending was more serious or less serious, because each played an important role in the distribution of drugs into the community. Contrary to the applicant’s submissions, her Honour did not find that Mr Scott’s offending was objectively less serious than the applicant’s.
	
	
	Her Honour may be taken to have accepted, favourably to the applicant, that there were relevant differences between the applicant and Mr Scott which explained the one year differential, in favour of the applicant, between the applicant’s sentence and the notional starting point of Mr Scott’s sentence. Those differences included: the applicant was found to have some prospects of rehabilitation; Wells DCJ found that Mr Scott’s prospects of rehabilitation could not be regarded as high. Mr Scott was a drug user with a habit who was also a supplier to others. The applicant was a supplier. Mr Scott committed his offences whilst subject to a s 9 bond for earlier drug offences. He was also sentenced for other offences. The applicant was not on conditional liberty at the time of his offending.
	
	
	The differential, again in the applicant’s favour, between the applicant’s non-parole period of 2 years 6 months (being 62.5% of the head sentence) and Mr Scott’s non-parole of 2 years 9 months (being 73%, or with the accumulation, 75% of the head sentence), is readily explained by her Honour’s finding of special circumstances in relation to the applicant, and there being no such finding by Wells DCJ in relation to Mr Scott.
	
	
	Contrary to the applicant’s submissions, her Honour did not find that the applicant played a greater role than Mr Scott in the offending. The effective differentiation of 12 months in favour of the applicant in circumstances where the gravity of the co-offender’s conduct was aggravated by reason of being committed whilst the co-offender was subject to a bond for the offence of supplying drugs, and where the applicant had a stronger subjective case than his co-offender is not, in my view, indicative of an unfair disparity between the sentences of the applicant and Mr Scott.
	
	
	This is not a case where the sentencing judge mistook the facts in assessing the criminality of the applicant and his co-offender, being the third kind of error in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505. Nor is it a case where the nature of the error may not be discoverable, but the result on the facts is plainly unreasonable or unjust, being error of the last kind referred to in House v The King: cf Velez v R [2015] NSWCCA 177 at [25]. On the contrary, her Honour’s recognition of the higher notional starting point of the co-offender’s sentence and the other relevant differences is fatal to the complaint of unfair disparity.
	
	
	Ground 3 has not been made out.
	


Conclusion


	
	In my view, the applicant has not established error in the sentencing process in accordance with grounds 1 and 2. Nor has the applicant established an objective justifiable sense of grievance under ground 3.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Grant leave to appeal.

(2)   Appeal dismissed.


	
	BUTTON J: I agree with Gleeson JA.
	
	
	FAGAN J: I agree with Gleeson JA.

2768303,Boney v R [2015] NSWCCA 291,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: I agree with RS Hulme AJ.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I agree with RS Hulme AJ.
	
	
	RS HULME AJ: On 6 February 2015 Judge Colefax SC sentenced the above named Applicant in respect of an offence of aggravated break enter and steal. The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 20 years and there is a standard non-parole period of 5 years. His Honour was asked to take into account an offence of attempting to steal a motor vehicle.
	
	
	The sentence imposed was of imprisonment for 4 years and 10 months including a non-parole period of 2 years and 10 months, both such periods commencing on 16 August 2014.
	
	
	The circumstances of the offending were that between about 11pm on 11 October 2013 and 8.30am on the next day, the offender broke into a 2 storey residential premises by forcing access through a window. A married couple and 3 children lived in the premises and the Applicant knew they were present at the time. A wallet containing identification cards, a handbag, and an i-phone were stolen.
	
	
	A motor vehicle parked in the driveway of the house was also broken into. The boot was found opened, a front door was not fully closed, and the ignition barrel of the vehicle was damaged.
	
	
	The Applicant was on parole at the time, having been released from custody on 23 July 2013. He pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity and received a 25% discount for doing so.
	
	
	The Applicant was born in April 1988, and is an Aboriginal. He has an extensive criminal history commencing in 2003. Colefax DCJ recorded that in the last 11 years the Applicant had been in custody for all but 18 months.
	
	
	The Applicant commenced participating in the use of cannabis at age 10, alcohol at age 13, and heroin at age 12 or 13. He commenced intravenous injections of heroin and using methylamphetamines at about 18 or 19. His education is virtually non-existent and he has no history of any useful work.
	
	
	Colefax DCJ remarked that the Applicant had a long history of mental disturbance, that he has borderline personality disorder and there are signs of psychotic episodes which may be connected with schizophrenia from which many members of his family suffer and/or may be caused by substance abuse.
	
	
	Before His Honour was a deal of evidence as to the Applicant’s subjective circumstances. This material included a report to the State Parole Authority dated 16 October 2013, a report from Dr Gordon Elliott, psychiatrist, dated 24 October 2014, remarks of Madgwick DCJ dated 16 September 2011 when his Honour imposed on the Applicant the sentence that led to the Applicant being on parole at the time of the offence for which he was sentenced by Colefax DCJ, and a report from the Family and Community Services Department.
	
	
	The first of these records that the Applicant was admitted to parole on 23 July 2013, that his initial response to parole was satisfactory but that drug screening conducted on 19 September 2013 was positive for amphetamine and methylamphetamine. Parole was not then revoked and the Applicant continued to have the support of his partner and the mother of his child and an indigenous support worker. On 14 October 2013 the Applicant said that he had attended the premises of Odyssey House but had been unable to contact anyone there. On 16 October the Applicant was arrested in respect of the offences dealt with by Colefax DCJ.
	
	
	Dr Elliott met with the Applicant on 7 October 2014 for about an hour. Dr Elliott’s conclusions included that the Applicant did not have a mental illness as defined in the Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW), may have mild developmental delay, but more probably his intellectual functioning was in the low or borderline normal range, impacted by his lack of schooling, and he was not developmentally disabled. He had used illicit substances as a primary coping strategy since childhood. Unsupported, his risk of relapse into substance abuse and thence criminal recidivism appears moderate to high. At the least he would need a 12 to 18 month residential rehabilitation program.
	
	
	To Dr Elliott the Applicant had expressed frustration about finding the means to change his life and, although he had participated in a number of drug and alcohol programs while in custody, also frustration with them as insufficient for his needs. Dr Elliott recorded that the Applicant appeared motivated to achieve long term abstinence but continued to use substances whilst in custody. The Applicant’s custodial record dated October 2014, however, records his last failed urine test as occurring in September 2012.
	
	
	Madgwick DCJ sentenced the Applicant for an unprovoked attack on a security guard, stealing his vehicle and then burning it. His Honour’s remarks reveal he had a deal of sympathy for the Applicant, informing him that the non-parole period being fixed – it was 2½ years in a 5½ years sentence - was well below normal in order to provide opportunity for intensive supervision in the community for a substantial period. His Honour made extensive reference to a psychological report which provided considerable detail of Mr Boney’s disadvantaged background, remarked that Mr Boney’s intelligence was in the extremely low range but quoted a remark of Mr Boney that “Crime is all I know”. His Honour observed that because of Mr Boney’s mental problems he was not disposed to afford general deterrence much weight but that personal deterrence and protection of the community loomed large. His Honour remarked that the Applicant was embarrassed at not being able to read and urged him to ask for education in prison.
	
	
	Despite the Applicant’s record his Honour found special circumstances on the ground that the Applicant’s age merited a longer than usual period on parole. The Applicant’s aboriginality and borderline personality disorder may also have influenced his Honour in finding special circumstances.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal are:
	



	
	The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The sentencing judge erred in failing to consider the referral of the Applicant for a compulsory drug treatment order.
	


Ground 1


	
	The foundation for this ground lies in remarks, and the order of remarks made by Colefax DCJ. After reciting the circumstances of the offending, his Honour continued:
	


The offence is aggravated by the fact that, at the time it was committed, the Offender was on parole. I have had the benefit of reading the remarks on sentence of his Honour Acting Judge Madgwick QC. The offence for which he was sentenced on that occasion was also a serious matter and involved gratuitous violence by this Offender.


	
	Drawing attention to remarks of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27], counsel for the Applicant submitted that his Honour had erred. Those remarks are:
	


The [standard non-parole period] requires that content be given to its specification as “the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness” [s 54A(2)]. Meaningful content cannot be given to the concept by taking into account characteristics of the offender. The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending.


	
	Colefax DCJ’s remarks were given ex-tempore on the day of and shortly after the conclusion of the sentencing hearing and allowance must be made for infelicities of expression. That said, and while I do not regard the matter as free from doubt, his Honour’s remarks do lead to the conclusion that he took into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence that the Applicant was on parole at the time. Ground 1 is made out.
	


Ground 2


	
	Since attaining the age of 18, the Applicant has been convicted of, inter alia, the following offences.
	



	
		
			
			July 2006
			
			
			Aggravated breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence (8 counts)
			
		
		
			
			June 2008
			
			
			Taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of an owner
			
		
		
			
			August 2008
			
			
			Possessing implement to enter or drive a conveyance.
			
		
		
			
			March 2009
			
			
			Larceny.
			
		
		
			
			December 2009
			
			
			Driving a conveyance taken without consent of the owner.
			
		
		
			
			June 2010
			
			
			Having goods in custody suspected of being stolen.
			
		
		
			
			August 2010
			
			
			Damaging property by fire.
			
		
		
			
			August 2010
			
			
			Aggravated robbery
			
		
	



	
	The above table, limited as it is to offences committed since the Applicant turned 18 demonstrates that he is a recidivist. That history and the Applicant’s subjective circumstances referred to above indicate that further imprisonment is unlikely to be of any benefit to him and that he desperately needs some other sanction against the lifestyle he has followed. However, no such practicable alternative was the subject of any evidence placed before Colefax DCJ and there are community interests quite separate from the interests of the Applicant to be served in the course of sentencing.
	
	
	When to that conclusion is added the fact that the subject offence was committed while on parole, it is impossible to conclude that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. This ground fails.
	


Ground 3


	
	Consideration of this ground requires attention to a number of provisions of the Drug Court Act 1998. Section 18B, which appears in Part 2A of the Act, entitled “Compulsory Drug Treatment Detention”, so far as is presently relevant provides:-
	



	
	This section applies to such courts as are prescribed by the regulations.
	
	
	It is the duty of a court to which this section applies that sentences a person to imprisonment or which, on determining an appeal, confirms a sentence if imprisonment imposed on the person by some other court (whether or not on the same terms as the other court):
	



	
	To ascertain whether there are grounds on which the Drug Court might find the person to be an eligible convicted offender, and
	
	
	If so, to refer the person to the Drug Court to determine whether the person should be the subject of a compulsory drug treatment order.
	
	
	(2B)   However, if the person whose sentence is confirmed by the appeal court is not already the subject of a compulsory drug treatment order, the duty imposed by this section applies to the appeal court, whether or not the court that imposed the sentence confirmed by the appeal court referred the person to the Drug Court under this section.
	



	
	The duty imposed on a court by this section is to be exercised as soon as practicable after the person is sentenced to imprisonment or the appeal is dealt with.
	
	
	(5)   No appeal lies against a court’s decision to refer or not to refer a person to the Drug Court for a determination as to whether the person should be the subject of a compulsory drug treatment order.
	



	
	For the purposes of s 18B(1), the District Court at Parramatta where the Applicant was sentenced and the Court of Criminal Appeal have been prescribed by the Regulations.
	
	
	The terms of s 18B(2) and (3) make it clear that the obligations imposed by s 18B on a sentencing court are to be fulfilled after it has imposed a sentence. Consequently compliance with the section is not required prior to sentence and non-compliance cannot affect the validity or correctness of any sentence imposed. Accordingly as an attack on the sentence imposed by Colefax DCJ this ground fails.
	


Other Matters


	
	The success of ground 1 means that it falls to this Court to consider what is an appropriate sentence for the Applicant’s offence and circumstances. Regard must also be had to the terms of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1916 which provides:-
	


On an appeal under s 5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.


	
	I have summarised above the objective features of the Applicant’s offending and also the evidence of subjective factors that was before Colefax DCJ. There was no further material as to those matters that was before this Court. While Colefax DCJ’s remarks on sentence lead to the conclusion that his assessment of the objective seriousness of the Applicant’s offending was influenced by his being on parole, I do not regard that assessment as incorrect. The building broken into was a dwelling house and not some other building and there were 5 persons, including children, inside. The criminality was deliberate.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that some sentence of greater or lesser severity than that imposed by Colefax DCJ was warranted and in those circumstances, notwithstanding the error identified, the appeal should be dismissed. Given the Applicant’s circumstances and, as I have concluded, the existence of error, I would grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the conclusion that Ground 3 fails, because this Court is one prescribed for the purposes of s 18B, it is necessary to give further attention to the terms of that section and the definition of eligible convicted offender.
	
	
	“Eligible Convicted Offender” is defined in s 5A as:-
	



	
	A person is an eligible convicted offender if:
	



	
	The person is convicted of an offence, other than an offence referred to in subsection (2), and
	
	
	Except as provided for by subsection (1A), the person has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for the offence to be served by way of full-time detention and at the time that the sentence was imposed:
	



	
	The unexpired non-parole period of the sentence was a period of at least 18 months, and
	
	
	The unexpired total sentence was a period of not more than 6 years, and
	



	
	[repealed]
	
	
	The person has a long-term dependency on the use of prohibited drugs (within the meaning of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985) or other drugs prescribed by the regulations, and
	
	
	The facts in connection with the offence for which the person has been sentenced together with the person’s antecedents and any other information available indicate that the offence was related to the person’s long-term drug dependency and associated lifestyle, and
	
	
	The person satisfies such other criteria as are prescribed by the regulations.
	
	
	(1A)   Subsection (1)(b) does not present a person whose parole order has been revoked from being an eligible convicted offender if the person is a relevant person within the meaning of section 18BA (State Parole Authority to refer certain offenders whose parole is revoked to Drug Court).
	



	
	A person is not eligible convicted offender if:
	



	
	The offence for which the person has been convicted involved the use of a firearm, or
	
	
	The person has been convicted at any time of any of the following:
	



	
	Murder, attempted murder or manslaughter,
	
	
	Sexual assault of an adult or child or a sexual offence involving a child,
	
	
	Any offence involving the violent use of a firearm,
	
	
	An offence under section 23(2), 24(2), 25(2), 26, 27 or 28 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 involving a commercial quantity or large commercial quantity of a prohibited plant or prohibited drug within the meaning of that Act,
	
	
	Any offence prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this section.
	



	
	A person is not an eligible convicted offender if, in the opinion of the Drug Court:
	



	
	The person suffers from a mental condition, illness or disorder that:
	



	
	Is serious, or
	
	
	Leads to the person being violent, and
	



	
	The mental condition, illness or disorder could prevent or restrict the person’s active participation in a drug treatment program.
	



	
	Counsel for the Applicant submitted that the Applicant was an eligible convicted offender and there can be little or no doubt that he fulfils many of the criteria:
	


(i)   The sentence imposed by Colefax DCJ meant that S 5A(1)(b) was satisfied;

(ii)   Even at the date of this Court’s decision those criteria still are. The expiration of the non-parole period fixed by Colefax DCJ on 15 June 2017 means it has a little over 18 months still to run and the unexpired total sentence was less than 6 years;


	
	(iii)   The Applicant had a long dependency on the use of prohibited drugs;
	
	
	(iv)   The circumstances of the offence indicated that it was related to the Applicant’s long term drug dependency; and
	
	
	(v)   The matters referred to earlier in these reasons indicate that the subject offence was related to the Applicant’s long-term drug dependency;
	
	
	(vi)   Regulations have prescribed criteria as envisaged by s 5A(1)(f). The only one of relevance would seem to be regulation 5 relating to the Applicant’s usual place of residence and he would seem to fulfil that requirement;
	
	
	(vii)   The Applicant’s criminal record indicates that he is not disqualified by most of the paragraphs in s 5A(2), although the evidence is not sufficient for a positive conclusion so far as paragraph (b)(iii) is concerned;
	
	
	(viii)   The issues raised by s 5A(3) are for the decision of the Drug Court.
	



	
	However, there is no need for this Court to come to a concluded view on all of these matters. Section 18B merely requires a sentencing Court (or this Court on appeal) “to ascertain whether there are grounds on which the Drug Court might find the person to be an eligible convicted offender”. I am satisfied that this requirement is fulfilled and accordingly that an order should be made under s 18B2(b).
	
	
	It remains to mention one other matter. Evidence put before the Court showed that the Applicant had been referred to the Drug Court prior to him being committed for sentence and that he was then judged by that Court to be ineligible. However, it seems clear that that referral was pursuant to Part 2 of the Drug Court Act and not Part 2A in which s 18B appears and that referral is presently irrelevant.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose the following orders:-
	


(i)   Grant leave to appeal;

(ii)   Dismiss the appeal;

(iii)   Confirm the sentence imposed by Colefax DCJ on 6 February 2015;

(iv)   Refer the Applicant to the Drug Court to determine whether the Applicant should be the subject of a compulsory drug treatment order.

	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the aggregate sentence on the sole ground that it is manifestly excessive.
	


Facts


	
	Surveillance devices fitted to a car driven by Dan Manu revealed reconnaissance had been carried out earlier in the evening of Thursday 10 May 2012 by him and Anthony Taufahema to identify a target for an armed robbery. They then drove to the applicant's home and from there the three proceeded to the Hunters Hill Club, arriving at about 9.00pm. They watched the club for a period of time, noting the activities of people and vehicles in the area. After some discussion about how best to successfully carry out the robbery, the applicant and Taufahema alighted while Manu remained in the car with the engine running.
	
	
	The applicant and Taufahema entered the club at about 9.30pm. They were wearing gloves, long clothing and face coverings and were carrying bags. Taufahema was armed with a tomahawk-style axe which he used to smash glass panels in order to force entry. The applicant was armed with a .22 calibre rifle. The judge was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the rifle was loaded; nor was he satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it was unloaded.
	
	
	The applicant and Taufahema confronted patrons with their weapons. Taufahema ran to the main bar where he struck a 45 year old patron with his shoulder, causing the patron to go to the ground. The applicant pointed his rifle in the direction of several of the patrons. Taufahema jumped over the bar and chased three staff members with his axe raised. The staff members ran to the safe room and locked themselves in. Taufahema put his axe into the safe room door but could not gain access.
	
	
	The applicant remained in the main room threatening patrons with his firearm. He yelled, ""Get on the ground"" and ""hand over the bags"". Patrons went to the floor, kneeling or lying. The applicant held the gun inches from the patrons' heads.
	
	
	As a result of his threats and demands, four middle-aged to elderly patrons handed over their personal property. These victims had been attending a farewell dinner with approximately 20 ladies from the local high school canteen.
	
	
	Taufahema re-joined the applicant and they ran out of the club through the smashed door. They were driven away by Manu. A live .22 calibre round was subsequently found on the floor in the area where the applicant had pointed his rifle at the back of a patron's head.
	
	
	The three offenders were driven to the home of Khaled Al Khaldi who was given the clothing and the weapons to conceal or dispose of.
	


The applicant's personal circumstances


	
	The applicant, who did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings, was almost 20 years of age at the time of the offences. He was born in New Zealand and came to Australia with his family in 1997. The Community Corrections Officer who prepared a Pre-Sentence Report recorded that he maintained close relations with his parents and siblings. He had been in a relationship for more than two years and he described it as a close and supportive one.
	
	
	The applicant has an extensive criminal history for someone so young; the judge described it as ""considerable"" and said that it warranted greater emphasis being given to personal deterrence.
	
	
	The applicant first encountered the criminal justice system in 2006 when he received a suspended control order for an offence of aggravated robbery. The sentence was reduced on appeal to a year's probation. He received another year's probation the following year for possessing car breaking implements. In breach of that probation he then committed offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and assault for which he received suspended custodial terms. He breached the conditions of his suspended sentence bond and received a term of juvenile detention. In the same court appearance he was dealt with for offences of resisting a police officer, damaging property and having suspected stolen goods in his custody, for which he received a nominal penalty, but also for an offence of affray for which he received detention for 10 months with a non-parole period of 4 months. Whilst on parole, the applicant committed offences of resisting and assaulting a police officer and he received 3 and 4 month terms of detention.
	
	
	On 8 February 2011 the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for just over 4 years with a non-parole period slightly exceeding 2 years for an offence of assault with intent to rob whilst armed. This involved an attempted robbery at a licensed club where staff and patrons were threatened with weapons and money was demanded. It was committed whilst the applicant was on bail and parole. An offence of break and enter with intent in circumstances of aggravation (being armed) was taken into account. This sentence dated from 19 December 2009 and was ordered to be served in a juvenile detention centre.
	
	
	While on parole in respect of the above matter the applicant committed two offences concerning the supply of drugs. It was after the commission of those offences but before he was charged, and whilst he was still on parole that the Hunters Hill Club robberies were committed.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested on 16 May 2012. His parole was revoked and he was required to serve the balance term of 1 year 8 months 17 days from 17 May 2012 until 2 February 2014.
	
	
	On 28 April 2014 he was sentenced in respect of the drug supply matters to a fixed term of imprisonment for a year dating from the day of imposition.
	
	
	At the date of sentencing for the index offences (26 May 2014), the position was that the applicant was subject to the drug supply sentence until 27 April 2015. Moreover, the period of pre-sentence custody from 16 May 2012 until 2 February 2014 had involved him serving the balance of parole in respect of the robbery sentence from 2011. The only period of pre-sentence custody not referrable to either of those other sentences was from 3 February to 27 April 2014; a period of just under 3 months.
	
	
	The judge discussed in detail in his sentencing remarks the competing submissions of the Crown and the applicant in relation to the question of back-dating the sentence. In the end, he determined to commence the aggregate term from 1 July 2012. This had the effect of completely subsuming the 1 year sentence for the drug supply matters as well as all but 45 days of the 1 year 8 month 17 days the applicant was required to serve as the balance of parole for his earlier robbery sentence.
	
	
	The Community Corrections Officer noted that the applicant's response to parole in the four months prior to his arrest for the present matters was ""poor as he displayed intimidating behaviours towards Community Corrections staff and was resistant to program participation to address his anger issues"". She also noted that he had subsequently exhibited in the correctional environment ""aggressive and threatening behaviours towards custodial staff"" and had a ""history of pugnacity"" towards them. The officer assessed the applicant as presenting a ""medium risk of re-offending"".
	


Some findings by the sentencing judge


	
	The judge accepted submissions that no-one was significantly injured in the robberies and (to my mind, surprisingly) that there was no ongoing psychological trauma because there was no evidence of it. (It might have been readily inferred that there was such trauma when patrons had a masked bandit forcing them to the floor and presenting a rifle within inches of their heads. It would have been a horrifying experience that would likely never be forgotten.)
	
	
	The judge accepted that the applicant was involved in planning for the robbery, although he acknowledged that he did not take part in the earlier reconnaissance.
	
	
	His Honour took into account that the applicant was still very young and had family support with a close-knit family visiting him in gaol. He was also being supported by his partner with whom he was in a close relationship. He accepted that the leniency often afforded to young offenders ""does come into play to some degree in these sentences"".
	
	
	The applicant had some disciplinary offences noted on his custodial record which prompted the judge to say that his response to custody had not been entirely satisfactory; a matter relevant to his rehabilitation prospects. The offences included assaults, intimidation and fighting.
	
	
	The judge accepted a submission that there were special circumstances warranting a longer period of parole on the basis that the applicant would benefit from a longer period of supervision in the community.
	
	
	On the question of concurrency, accumulation and totality, the judge said:
	


""Mr Buckman submitted that the offender Vai's sentences should be concurrent, having regard to the principle of totality. I indicated that I proposed limited accumulation to provide distinct punishment for the offences but recognising that they are part of the same criminal episode at the same time and place. Mr Buckman submitted that I should not do that, and that all the offences were committed within a very short period in one episode of criminality, and that concurrent sentences were appropriate. I disagree with that submission.""


	
	The judge accepted a submission by the Crown that the applicant had a history of violence and of habitually breaching court orders. He also accepted that the present offences were aggravated by virtue of having been committed four months after the applicant had been released on parole.
	
	
	His Honour accepted the Crown's submission that the robberies were worse than the typical case described in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346. The reasons for this included that the offences were contrary to s 97(2), not s 97(1), for which there was prescribed a higher maximum penalty; that there were two weapons used; that the weapons were not merely present at the time but were used to threaten the patrons; that there were a number of other patrons present in addition to those who were specific victims; that the staff of the club were vulnerable; and that there was substantial planning and premeditation. The judge concluded that the criminality in the offences was ""mid-range"".
	
	
	The judge also accepted a Crown submission that the applicant had committed similar offences in the past so he would have been aware of the consequences. However, he concluded that the applicant had ""reasonable prospects of rehabilitation depending on the outcome of programs"" he would recommend be undertaken both in prison and on parole. He also considered that he had ""reasonable"" prospects of not re-offending.
	
	
	The applicant was not considered to have shown any remorse; he had denied the offences but had been convicted at his trial. He maintained his innocence to the Community Corrections Officer.
	


Determination


	
	Counsel for the applicant contended that the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive. He argued that this was a result of excessive indicative sentences and an excessive degree by which they were notionally accumulated. The latter was said to be particularly so given the offences occurred over a very short period of time and were part of the one criminal episode.
	
	
	These submissions were maintained in oral argument by counsel who did not prepare the written submissions. It was also contended that error occurred in the setting of the non-parole period because it was of a different proportion to the head sentence to the proportions adopted for the indicative sentences. The short answer to that is that specifying non-parole periods for the indicative sentences was an unnecessary and fruitless exercise: see JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [39] (proposition 7). I do not understand why his Honour did so, and I do not understand the proportions he chose to adopt.
	
	
	The applicant had youth and family support in his favour. He had guarded findings as to his rehabilitation prospects. There was nothing else in his subjective case that operated in mitigation. His criminal history, including matters of violence and persistent breaches of conditional liberty, warranted significant emphasis being given to personal deterrence.
	
	
	The primary question is whether the aggregate sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust when regard is had to the totality of criminality involved as well as to the matters just mentioned that stood in the applicant's favour. In my view the answer must be firmly in the negative.
	
	
	It must be borne in mind that the maximum penalty for 5 out of the 6 offences is imprisonment for 25 years. They involved a planned and very violent invasion of a licensed club by two armed and masked offenders with another waiting outside. There were multiple mature-aged patrons who were confronted with what must have been a terrifying experience. Victims were forced by the applicant to kneel or lie on the floor and had a rifle presented to their heads while being forced to hand over items of personal property. Staff were confronted by the co-offender wielding an axe as he leapt over the bar and pursued them.
	
	
	Without any discount that might have been afforded if there had been pleas of guilty, the aggregate sentence of 10 years for the series of offences, albeit in the one robbery enterprise, is hardly one that the applicant should be heard to complain about. This is particularly so when he had a terrible history for a person of his age for violence and had only recently been released on parole in respect of an earlier but similar robbery. He remained unrepentant and had guarded prospects of not re-offending in the future. The sentence was clearly one that was within the legitimate range of the judge's sentencing discretion.
	
	
	This proposed appeal is, in my view, utterly devoid of merit. It could be characterised as ""unarguable or frivolous"". That brings into consideration s 18 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) which is in the following terms:
	


""18 Certain time to count as part of appellant’s sentence

(1) (Repealed)

(2) The time during which an appellant is at liberty on bail (pending the determination of his or her appeal) does not count as part of any term of imprisonment under the appellant’s sentence.

(3) The time during which an appellant is held in custody counts as part of any term of imprisonment under the appellant’s sentence. However, if the court is satisfied that the appeal was unarguable or frivolous, the court may order that the time in custody does not count.""


	
	It used to be the default position that time served pending the hearing of an appeal did not count unless the Court ordered. For the manner in which the Court applied that provision, see the observations of Gleeson CJ in R v Costache (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 13 November 1990, unrep) as well as R v Cuthbertson [1974] 1 NSWLR 672.
	
	
	This was raised with counsel for the applicant at today's hearing. It was acknowledged that the Court has not, to my knowledge, applied s 18 since it was amended by the Courts Legislation Further Amendment Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	The Court should not do so in the present case because there was no prior warning that it might do so. However, practitioners should be aware of the possibility the Court might do so in a similar case in the future.

	BEAZLEY P: I agree with the reasons of Justice R A Hulme and with the orders he proposes.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with the reasons given by Justice R A Hulme that leave to appeal against sentence should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	R A HULME J: The applicant was sentenced by her Honour Judge English in the District Court at Penrith on 17 October 2014 in respect of child sexual assault offences to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 22 years with a non-parole period of 16 years with effect from 23 May 2014.
	
	
	The applicant cannot be identified because doing so would tend to identify his victim. For this reason a pseudonym has been used in the name of this judgment.
	
	
	Details of the offences and the indicative sentences appear in the following table. All of the offences concerned the applicant's stepdaughter and occurred in a two year period when she was aged 9 to 11. The offences are all contrary to provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and standard non-parole periods pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) applied to some.

	The applicant was found guilty of these offences at trial. The jury was not required to return a verdict on count 4 as it was in the alternative to count 3. Verdicts of not guilty were returned in respect of counts 9 and 10.
	


Facts


	
	The applicant commenced a relationship with the victim's mother when the victim was 2 years of age in 2004. He married the mother in 2006.
	
	
	The matter came to light when the complainant informed her mother on 9 April 2013 when she was 11 years of age, that the applicant had been sexually abusing her. The applicant was confronted and denied it. The complainant was interviewed by police that evening and disclosed the following details about the offences for which the applicant was ultimately convicted.
	


Offences in 2011 when victim aged 9


	
	Counts 1 and 2: This event represented the first occasion when the applicant had assaulted the victim. She was watching a movie and the applicant laid beside her and started kissing her. She described the kisses as ""long in duration and tongue kisses"". The applicant then removed their clothing and continued kissing her and squeezed her bottom. He then got up and went to his bedroom.
	
	
	Count 3: The next occasion the applicant assaulted the victim was when she went into his bedroom to say goodnight one evening when her mother was working. He got her to lie on the bed, kissed her, and removed their clothing. Using some lubricant he then penetrated her vagina with his penis. The victim was too scared to ask him to stop.
	
	
	Counts 5 and 6: The next incident occurred in almost identical circumstances but involved the applicant simulating vaginal intercourse with the victim in his bed. The applicant then turned the victim over and had anal intercourse with her. She said that it hurt but was too scared to tell him to stop.
	


Offences in 2012 when victim aged 10


	
	Count 7: The victim went into the applicant's bedroom to say goodnight and when she went to leave he dragged her back and asked for ""a proper kiss"". She kissed him on the cheek and then agreed to give him a hug. He then put her onto the bed and had anal intercourse with her. When she later went to the toilet she said she saw a ""creamish"" colour fluid came out of her bottom which she thought was ""maybe a sperm"".
	
	
	Count 8: This was another occasion in 2012 and involved the victim kissing the applicant goodnight. He took her to his bedroom, removed their clothing and rubbed his penis against her ""front part"". He suggested she sleep with him that night (her mother was again at work) but she wanted to sleep in her own bedroom. He went with her to her bedroom and there rubbed his penis against her vagina.
	


Offences in February-March 2013 when victim aged 11


	
	Counts 11-14: Count 11 involved the applicant rubbing his penis against the victim's vagina whilst in his bedroom. Count 12 involved digital penetration of her anus and count 13 involved insertion of his penis. The applicant left the room but when he returned he ""tongue kissed"" her and then digitally penetrated her vagina (count 14). She told him that it hurt and he withdrew. She put her clothes back on and went to bed.
	
	
	There were uncharged acts of sexual abuse as well which involved inappropriate acts of kissing.
	


Remarks on sentence


	
	The judge made reference to a number of matters pertinent to sentencing including:
	


The applicant abused his position of trust by sexually assaulting a young girl over a lengthy period of time such that it became almost normal to her. He took advantage of her vulnerability while her mother was absent from the family home.

The victim took steps on many occasions to try to dissuade the applicant from assaulting her but to no avail.

The victim had been deprived of a normal childhood; having been violated in the most heinous of ways by someone who she should have been able to love unconditionally and to trust.

The victim was entitled to grow up in a loving and supportive environment free from sexual molestation. Her home should have been a sanctuary where she felt safe and secure.

The family had been torn apart. The victim had been deprived of the relationship with her mother and half-sister. Fortunately she had the love and support of her biological father and his family.

There was no violence; but there did not need to be. A callous exercise of willpower and authority overcame this young child.

The applicant had shown no remorse. He had not demonstrated any awareness of the impact his offending behaviour had upon his victim.

The applicant was otherwise of relatively good character. His criminal antecedents were minor. But having regard to the repeated nature of the offending over a lengthy period of time, this would be given less weight in the circumstances.

The applicant had said in a letter to the court that he was on protection but he was able to participate in activities and attend courses. He expressed a willingness to undergo a ""deniers program for sexual offenders"".

Unless the applicant attended and committed to sexual offenders' counselling, his rehabilitation prospects were guarded.


	
	The judge said that the most serious offence was the act of penile/anal penetration with ejaculation. That matter ""falls at the midrange"" and ""I can see no reason why I should depart from applying the standard non-parole period in the circumstances"".
	
	
	The offences in counts 1 and 2 were ""not so serious as to warrant the imposition of fulltime custodial penalties were it not for the other offences committed by this offender"".
	
	
	“The act of placing his penis into the genital area of the victim but not penetrating her is a serious example of an aggravated indecent assault” which “falls below the midrange which would attract a standard non-parole period of 8 years”.
	
	
	""The acts (sic) of penile vaginal intercourse are of course also objectively serious but given the facts, is not as serious as the act (sic) of penile/anal intercourse.""
	
	
	Her Honour acknowledged the need for care in accumulation ""because of the compounding impact of long sentences"". She said, ""Sentences should not crush any hope or desire for rehabilitation that a prisoner might belatedly feel"".
	
	
	Special circumstances were found so as to provide for a longer parole period because of the accumulation of sentences; that this would be the applicant's first time in custody; and the need for rehabilitation upon release.
	
	
	Her Honour expressed a need for a significant element of general deterrence in relation to offences of this type. There was a need for the applicant and the community to ""understand that such crimes will be met with stern and retributive punishment"". She referred also to the need to denounce what the applicant had done, to recognise the harm done to the child, and to protect the community from him.
	


Ground   The sentencing judge patently erred with respect to the indicative sentences resulting in the sentencing miscarrying

Applicant's submissions


	
	The applicant's counsel contended that the following errors were patent in the specification of some of the indicative sentences:
	


Counts 1 and 2: Her Honour said that these offences did not of themselves warrant a custodial sentence. Yet she determined that because of the subsequent offending which demanded a custodial sentence, it was necessary to impose custodial sentences for counts 1 and 2.

Count 6: In concluding this offence fell within the middle range of objective seriousness, her Honour was mistakenly of the view that it involved the applicant ejaculating. It would appear that her Honour when considering the standard non-parole period with respect to counts 3 and 6 had conflated the objectively more serious facts represented by count 7.

Count 6: Further, her Honour gave the prescribed standard non-parole period determinative significance by asking herself whether there were reasons to depart from it, contrary to Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.

Counts 7 and 13: Her Honour indicated a sentence the equivalent of the maximum penalty notwithstanding an implicit finding of mid-range criminality.


	
	It was submitted that these errors would necessarily have impacted upon the final aggregate sentence.
	


Crown response


	
	The Crown contended that her Honour did not err in relation to the indication of sentences of imprisonment in respect of counts 1 and 2. They might have warranted non-custodial sentences if they stood alone but they were not isolated offences and represented part of a ""grooming"" process for the more serious offences.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that her Honour erroneously regarded the offence in count 6 (s 66A(2)) as ""the most objectively serious"" because it involved anal intercourse with ejaculation. She found it fell within the midrange and warranted application of the standard non-parole period. In fact, it was count 7 that involved such intercourse with ejaculation but that was an offence contrary to s 66C(2) for which no standard non-parole period applied.
	
	
	The Crown contended, however, that the misstatement of ejaculation in relation to count 6 would have made little, if any, difference in the determination of the indicative sentence.
	
	
	Whilst accepting the conflation of the facts of count 7 with that of count 6, the Crown resisted such a conclusion in relation to the other offence of anal intercourse in count 3. Nothing in the judge's sentencing remarks supported the applicant's proposition.
	
	
	The Crown conceded that there was error in the judge specifying indicative sentences for counts 7 and 13 which equated to the maximum penalty. They were not in the worst category of this type of offence and the judge said nothing to suggest that she thought they were.
	
	
	The Crown also conceded that there was ""Muldrock-error"" in relation to count 6.
	


Conclusion


	
	I accept the Crown's submission that there was no error in relation to the indication of 1 month sentences for counts 1 and 2. Moreover, it cannot be thought that if there was such error in the specification of those indicative sentences there was any practical impact upon the assessment of the aggregate sentence. An appeal, of course, is against the sentence imposed, in this case an aggregate sentence; there is no appeal against indicative sentences: JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [40] (propositions 11 and 12).
	
	
	There was error in attributing the ejaculation that occurred in the count 7 offence to count 6 which clearly affected the judge's assessment of the seriousness of count 6.
	
	
	The contention that the judge also erroneously took ejaculation into account in relation to the count 3 offence is not borne out by anything the judge said.
	
	
	The applicant's submissions, and the Crown's concessions, as to the specification of indicative sentences at the level of the maximum penalty for counts 7 and 13 should be accepted. So too should the submission and concession as to “Muldrock-error” in relation to count 6. The High Court was clear in Muldrock (at [25]):
	


""The court is not required when sentencing for a Div 1A [standard non-parole period] offence to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period nor to proceed to an assessment of whether the offence is within the midrange of objective seriousness.""


	
	In assessing the sentences for counts 7 and 13 the judge was ""obliged… to take into account the full range of factors in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence"" while being ""mindful of two legislative guideposts: the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period"" (Muldrock at [27])
	


Re-sentencing


	
	Error having been established, there is a need for this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh in order to determine whether some other sentence whether more or less severe is warranted and should have been passed: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) and Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at [42].
	


Applicant's submissions


	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that a sentence ""significantly less substantial"" should be imposed when regard is had to the following matters:
	


1.   Counts 12 and 14 involved digital penetration which was a less serious matter than penile penetration.

2.   Counts 3 and 6 involved sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10, but the victim was only just under that age. This type of offence can also concern infants and toddlers.

3.   There was no evidence of the use of physical violence. If present, this would be an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

4.   There was only a limited degree of actual physical pain and for a relatively short duration during some of the offences.

5.   Aside from the obvious humiliation in the commission of the offences, there were no other circumstances of humiliation.

6.   Sexual offences against children are frequently accompanied by threats to the well-being of the child and frequently to other persons that they love. There was no evidence of that in this case.

7.   This was not a case in which pain and distress to a victim is immediately evident to the perpetrator who continues the offending behaviour nonetheless.

Crown submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that each of the offences, aside from those in counts 1 and 2, were serious crimes as is reflected in the prescribed maximum penalties: imprisonment for 10 years, 20 years and life. There were also significant standard non-parole periods that had to be considered as additional guideposts.
	
	
	Reference was made to R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56 where the Court (Leeming JA, Johnson and Hall JJ) said:
	


“[87] The maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods are important legislative guideposts for the purpose of sentence: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at 132 [27]. This is particularly so with respect to the three s 66A(2) offences, each of which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years.

[88] A further feature is relevant to the s 66A(2) offences. As a result of statutory amendments in 2009, the maximum penalty for this offence was increased from 25 years' imprisonment to life imprisonment.

[89] The fixing of a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for an offence under s 66A(2) was done ‘in recognition of the heinousness of committing such an aggravated offence against a child under the age of 10 years’ (second reading speech of the Attorney General for the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Bill 2008, Hansard, Legislative Council, 26 November 2008). In the course of the second reading speech, the Attorney General stated that the sentence increase contained in s 66A(2) was recommended in the 2008 Report of the NSW Sentencing Council entitled ‘Penalties Relating to Sexual Assault Offences in New South Wales’.

[90] It is well established that the increase by the legislature in the maximum penalty for conduct proscribed by s 66A(2) must be reflected in the sentences which trial courts impose: R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 227; R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [52]; Muldrock v The Queen at 133 [31]; Leslie at 144-145 [79].

[91] As Beech-Jones J observed with respect to s 66A(2) in GN v R at [86], ‘a maximum term of life imprisonment is the most emphatic statement of the seriousness of the offence that the legislature may make’. McCallum J noted in PK v R at [4] that ‘aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under ten is among the most serious of criminal offences in this State’.”


	
	The Crown submitted that when all relevant matters were assessed by this Court the conclusion would be reached that nothing less than that imposed at first instance was warranted.
	


Determination


	
	Care is required in relation to the contention that counts 12 and 14 were less serious because they involved digital as opposed to penile penetration. As a general proposition that is not necessarily the case. As was observed in R v Gavel :
	


""[97] … It is erroneous to attempt to rank forms of sexual intercourse in some hierarchy so as to determine their objective seriousness. The objective seriousness of offending is to be determined according to the entirety of the facts and circumstances of the case in question: Doe v R [2013] NSWCCA 248 at [54]; Simpson v R [2014] NSWCCA 23 at [33]-[34].”


	
	However, in this case it would be appropriate to regard the offences in counts 12 and 14 as being less serious than the other sexual intercourse offences (counts 3, 6, 7 and 13) that involved penile/vaginal or penile/anal penetration.
	
	
	In oral submissions, counsel for the applicant emphasised that there was an absence of statutory (s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) or other aggravating circumstances in support of a submission that the offending was “low to midrange”. Arguably, some of the offences might fall below the middle of the range, but not all of them do.
	
	
	That counts 3 and 6 involved intercourse with a 9 year old where the offence in s 66A(2) can be committed against a child of any age under 10 is not a mitigating factor. Similarly, the absence of an aggravating feature of physical violence does not operate in mitigation. The same can be said about the absence of physical pain, humiliation and threats. These arguments are akin to saying, ""the offence is less serious because it could have been more serious"". As Grove J observed in Saddler v R [2009] NSWCCA 83; 194 A Crim R 452:
	


""[3] It is a well-established common law sentencing principle that the absence of a factor which would elevate the seriousness of offending in a particular case is not a matter of mitigation. In plain language, it does not make what has been done by an offender less serious because it could have been worse.""


	
	A similar response must be made concerning the submission that the applicant did not persist with offending in the face of evident pain and distress displayed by the victim. There is nothing to suggest that the applicant was not fully aware of the gross acts of abuse he was perpetrating against a young child. He took advantage of the fact that because of her innocence and lack of comprehension of the heinous wrong that was being done to her she did not complain which allowed him to continue his abuse over a substantial period of time.
	
	
	Whilst I would not necessarily adopt all of the language used by the learned sentencing judge in describing the dimension of the applicant's crimes see above (at [16]), I am in respectful agreement with the sense of it.
	
	
	It is appropriate to again refer to R v Gavel for its succinct statement as to the effect upon children of offences of this type:
	


""[110] This Court has observed that child sex offences have profound and deleterious effects upon victims for many years, if not the whole of their lives: R v CMB [2014] NSWCCA 5 at [92]. Sexual abuse of children will inevitably give rise to psychological damage: SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 255 at [52]. In R v G [2008] UKHL 37; [2009] 1 AC 92, Baroness Hale of Richmond (at [49]) referred to the ‘long term and serious harm, both physical and psychological, which premature sexual activity can do’. The absolute prohibition on sexual activity with a child is intended to protect children from the physical and psychological harm taken to be caused by premature sexual activity: Clarkson v R [2011] VSCA 157; 32 VR 361 at 364 [3], 368-372 [26]-[39].

[111] This factor no doubt contributes to the setting of the heaviest maximum penalty known to the criminal law for s 66A(2) offences, accompanied by a standard non-parole period of 15 years. It is important that sentences for s 66A(2) offences reflect this grave element implicit in the offence itself.

[112] This is an important feature in the present case. Young child victims are especially vulnerable. It is important that sentences passed for s 66A(2) offences recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime: s 3A(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.""


	
	The applicant had very little to offer in terms of subjective mitigating factors. His prior good character must be taken into account. I would agree with the primary judge's assessment that his rehabilitation prospects are guarded and very much dependent upon his engagement with sexual offender treatment programs. His prospects of success would be enhanced if he acknowledged his wrongdoing; something he is presently not prepared to do.
	
	
	I consider that nothing other than a term of imprisonment is appropriate for counts 1 and 2 having regard to their objective seriousness and the unavailability or lack of utility in other sentencing options. The assessment of objective seriousness for these offences is informed more by the offences forming part of the grooming and sexualisation of the child than the acts involved.
	
	
	There is no requirement to specify non-parole periods for indicative sentences where a standard non-parole period does not apply: JM v R at [39] (proposition 7). Moreover, whilst it seems to be often done, there is no practical purpose served in doing so. And I would certainly not engage in a process of setting indicative sentences at the level of what might otherwise have been the non-parole period as was done in McIntosh v R [2015] NSWCCA 184 for the reasons expressed in the comment on that case in Criminal Law News (2015) 22(8) Crim LN [3572].

	I would not find special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The reasons given by the primary judge (accumulation, first time in custody, need for rehabilitation after release) do not persuade me that the period I would allow for parole by following the statutory ratio would be inadequate.
	
	
	Having regard to those individual sentences I am mindful of the need to make an assessment of the totality of the applicant’s criminality. The aggregate sentence I would impose is no less than that imposed by the judge at first instance.

2768332,R v Barden [2015] NSWDC 395,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Jackson Barden stands for sentence as a consequence of having pleaded guilty to a charge that on 1 April 2015 at Woolooware in this State he did knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely 8.28 grams of the drug commonly known as Nexus in tablet form and the offender also asks me to take into account on a Form 1 four further offences also committed on 1 April 2015.
	
	
	All the offences were committed at Woolooware Railway Station. The first was having in his possession a prohibited drug, namely .66 grams of a drug commonly known as ecstasy. The next offence was having in his possession a prohibited drug, namely .13 grams of cocaine. The next offence on the Form 1 was one of dealing with certain property, namely four $50 bills that there were reasonable grounds to believe were the proceeds of crime. The final offence on the Form 1 is a urinating on platform number 1 at the Woolooware Railway Station.
	
	
	The principal offence to which the offender pleaded guilty carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years and or a fine of $220,000. The maximum penalty for each of the drug offences on the Form 1 is imprisonment for two years and or a fine of $2,200. The maximum penalty for dealing with the proceeds of crime is two years imprisonment and or a fine of $5,500. The maximum penalty for behaving in an offensive manner, which is the formal appellation for urinating on a train platform, is a fine of $1,100. It is important to bear in mind the maximum penalty prescribed by Parliament for the primary offence for which the offender stands for sentence. The maximum penalty imposed by Parliament indicates the seriousness of the offence which Parliament has proscribed.
	
	
	The facts of the case are fairly straightforward. At around 8.30pm on Wednesday 1 April 2015 police were patrolling Woolooware Railway Station when they observed the offender urinating next to the ticket booth on platform 1. The police approached the offender and identified themselves to him. He was observed to be holding a number of $50 notes in his hand together with a plastic bag. The police asked the offender:
	


“What have you got in your hand?”

No response is recorded on the agreed facts. Police then arrested the offender for urinating on the platform and as they took hold of his arm he flicked the plastic bag and the cash he was holding onto the ground behind the police. The police saw what he did and picked up the items he had thrown on the ground. They then identified four $50 notes, a plastic bag containing 24 round tablets bearing a Nike Swoosh logo and a smaller plastic bag containing an additional three such tablets and a plastic bag containing six clear capsules. The tablets were found to be the drug commonly known as Nexus. The six capsules contained the drug known as Ecstasy. The offender was then cautioned. He was asked about the tablets that had been found with him. He told the police that he obtained them from a male “in a laneway near Cronulla Surf Club for a mate to take to a party in Bondi”. The offender stated that he was not sure what the tablets were but he thought they might be Ecstasy. The police asked the offender why he had thrown the items away and the offender said:

“I just thought I’d get rid of them”.

That clearly indicates that he knew that they were prohibited drugs which ought not to be found in his possession.


	
	The offender was then searched and the police found a clear plastic bag containing a white substance located in the front right hand pocket of his trousers. That on analysis was found to be .13 grams of cocaine. When asked about that the offender stated that he did not know that they were there as the trousers he was wearing were not his own. Clearly the plea which he has entered and the four matters he asks me to take into account on the Form 1 indicate that the offender knew that the drug was on his person at the time. The offender was then taken to Miranda Police Station and introduced to the custody manager and processed. He has actually spent no time in custody.
	
	
	The offender told the police at the police station that during the evening he had consumed a number of beers and had had two Ecstasy tablets about seven hours prior to his being arrested. There are alternative versions of what the offender had consumed prior to his arrest. The pre-sentence report indicates the offender had consumed “approximately two bottles of wine” which may be a Corrective Services officer’s estimate of approximately 14 to 16 standard drinks. Since 18 July 2015, the offender has been seeing a psychologist, a Mr Salvatore Sorbello, at Kirrawee. The offender gave Mr Sorbello a history that he consumed approximately ten beers, some wine, Ecstasy and a small amount of cocaine before he was arrested. Whichever version one looks at, it appears that the offender had taken a fair amount of alcohol and probably illicit drugs prior to committing the offence of urinating on the railway platform which led to him being arrested.
	
	
	It has been very correctly submitted by learned counsel for the offender that the offender’s actions, and what he said to the police after his arrest concerning his alcohol and drug use earlier that day, suggest a degree of intoxication, and such is not conduct one might reasonably expect from any person who regularly dealt drugs to members of the public. In other words, one would not expect a drug trafficker to be carrying illicit drugs and trying to “offload them” in such a highly intoxicated state.
	
	
	It appears to be common ground that the offender was in company with about eight of his friends, that they were bound for Bondi to attend a concert or dance party and an inference can be drawn that the offender was somehow involved in purchasing drugs to pass them on to members of his group of friends to be consumed at the concert or dance party. Such has been the submission of the offender’s counsel. Equally bearing in mind that the level of purity of the drug Nexus in each of the tablets was only 1.5%, one might think the offender had been “ripped off” by being sold such low quality drugs by the person from whom he had purchased the drugs near Cronulla Surf Lifesaving Club.
	
	
	Before going on to consider matters of principle, it is convenient at this stage to record the offender’s personal circumstances. The offender was born on 24 June 1989. He is currently 26 years of age. At the time of these offences he was 25. The offender is the elder child of his parents. He has a sister who is one year his junior. The offender grew up at Grays Point where his family still lives and to where he has returned to live since relatively soon after being arrested. The offender’s father has the qualifications of a plumber and, although he spent five years in the New South Wales police, returned to plumbing with his own business which he began in the 1990’s. The offender’s mother works as a teacher at the Kirrawee High School. The offender comes from an intact, hardworking, middle class family.
	
	
	The offender attended Grays Point public school and then Kirrawee High School. He found it difficult to concentrate at school and was not motivated to achieve academically. However he appears to have excelled at sport, in particular at soccer, skateboarding, water polo and basketball. He also became a keen surfer. He completed his HSC. However in the final years of school things began to go awry. From the age of about 16 the offender started drinking alcohol. About a year later he took up smoking cannabis. Cannabis consumption led to his taking ecstasy and other pills, probably amphetamines, by the time he was 18, after he had completed the HSC.
	
	
	The offender told psychologist who has been treating him since 18 July 2015 that he became a ‘party animal.’ Part of Mr Sorbello’s history is as follows;
	


“From his late teens until he was charged, Jackson’s life revolved around party, drug taking, and chasing girls. He said he mainly used alcohol, marijuana, and ecstasy on the weekends at parties, clubs. Cocaine was consumed only occasionally because it was too expensive.”


	
	When still at school the offender worked for a surfboard manufacturer when he was between 15 and 17 years old. After leaving school, he commenced an apprenticeship as a carpenter but lost that position because of absenteeism due to drug and alcohol use. The offender then worked as an apprentice plumber for his father. His father obviously had suspicions about his son’s substance abuse which made him unreliable. The offender kept denying that he was taking illicit drugs. After completing his apprenticeship of five years, the offender worked for a different plumbing company for six months, but his drug use impaired his ability to work and he lost that job. He then worked as a kitchen hand for about six months.
	
	
	From Mr Sorbello’s history I know that in February 2014 the offender went overseas with his male friends to Central and South America. They were overseas from February 2014 to September 2014. The offender visited Chile, Peru, Bolivia and Columbia and other South American countries. Illicit drugs were cheap in many of those countries and the offender’s use of cocaine increased markedly whilst in South America. He used cocaine and drank alcohol most of the days between February and September 2014. When he returned to Sydney he found the habit hard to lose and used cocaine three or four days every week and drank alcohol daily.
	
	
	It is possible that, because of his increased consumption of cocaine in Australia after September 2014, the offender needed to obtain more money to buy the drug and that caused him to turn to supplying drugs to others. However, that is only one possibility. The evidence before me only establishes the offender’s having a relatively large amount of illicit drugs on him on 1 April 2015 and the evidence points to a likely intention to supply his friends at a party rather than supplying members of the public for profit.
	
	
	The commission of this offence has been a major “wake-up call” for the offender and I have there used his own words to me. The offender has expressed deep regret and remorse but clearly that is because of the shame he has brought upon himself and the heartache and embarrassment he has given to his parents and his extended family. However he admits that the drug addiction which led to the commission of these offences is something that he must defeat. In his letter to me he said this;
	


“I have limited my chances of travel, work opportunities and life experiences at an age where I should be in my prime. I would take it all back if I could, but I can’t, the consequences of my actions scare the hell out of me and I have changed my ways. I have sought help with counselling and that has helped me deal with my issues and I feel better about myself and know where I want to be and what I have to do to achieve to it. No more filling a void with a fake illicit temporary outlet. It is the wake-up call I needed and I hope and pray that you believe me, but my words are cheap. I want the chance to redeem myself and make myself, and my family proud, please give me this chance!”

The path which this offender pursued this Court sees daily and has been seen for decades: young teenagers take up smoking cannabis, move to “party drugs” leading to heavier drugs such as cocaine and heroin, and then start to commit crime to support an illicit drug habit. This offender has not faired as badly as many of those with whom the Court is called upon to sentence. This offender has not committed offences of breaking entering and stealing or robbery or crimes of violence. However, he was in possession of a quantity of drugs which was capable of being a supply. He had not reached the stage that many other young people do whom have followed the path I have just described.


	
	It is clear that the offender now has insight; he is now abstinent from illicit drugs and has severely moderated his alcohol intake. Since his arrest the offender worked for about a month as a builder’s labourer and, for the last three months, has worked as a leading hand for a business called “Heavy Duty Plumbing Pty Limited,” who consider the offender to have an important role in the daily running of its business and to have a “great work ethic” and to be a person who is good natured. The offender’s employer was interviewed by the Corrective Services Officers in the preparation of the pre-sentence report and he was described as a “hard worker” by his employer. The offender works eight hours per day six days per week. He has been provided by his current employer with a car and mobile phone. The offender has returned to TAFE to obtain his higher grade plumber’s qualification. He hopes to complete those studies early 2016.
	
	
	The offender was referred to Mr Sorbello by a general practitioner in July 2015. The psychologist diagnosed a stimulant use disorder now in early remission and an alcohol use disorder also in early remission. The offender has not used drugs for at least the last three months that is, since he came under the care of Mr Sorbello and has consumed very little alcohol. Recent testing does show the offender to have mild amounts of depression and a moderate amount of anxiety but one would expect such findings in a young man standing for sentence facing the prospect of a fulltime custodial sentence. That is acknowledged in fact by Mr Sorbello. As well as giving up drugs and limiting his alcohol the offender has over the last four months started attending the gym, taken up active surfing, and has been eating well. In other words he is now looking after himself. The fact that the offender has turned his life around has been deposed to on oath by the offender’s father. Mr Sorbello has proposed treatment of the offender extending into and throughout 2016. The treatment plan is set out on the final page of Mr Sorbello’s report. It includes cognitive behaviour therapy which will not end until June 2016. Beyond that the offender has to set future career and personal goals throughout next year by using cognitive behaviour worksheets.
	
	
	I am confident that the offender, if he stays abstinent from illegal drugs, will not reoffend and that his rehabilitation will be successful. That is in the interests of the offender himself and of our community. It costs a lot of money to lock people up in gaol. It also provides no real rehabilitation at the current time. Ultimately the criminal law and the community is best served by turning persons away from crime and returning them to a meaningful and proper, active role in our society. I accept that the offender is well‑motivated at the moment and is to be encouraged to persist with his treatment by Mr Sorbello and to maintain his current determination to stay away from drugs. The prospects of rehabilitation, in my view, are very good. However all that can be done to ensure that the offender maintains his current determination should be pursued.
	
	
	The offender has returned to reside with his parents because he has debts which he is seeking to repay and was finding rent too much to pay. From what I have heard from Mr Timothy Barden I believe it likely that the offender will stay living with his family for some little time yet, to get himself back on his feet and perhaps to set up his own business as a plumber.
	
	
	It has been submitted by Mr Pickin, for the offender, that the quantity of the drugs found with the offender was generally speaking “relatively low” and that the value of the drugs was likely to be perhaps between $500 and $600. I do not know whether that be correct or not but considering the number of drugs and their poor quality that may well be correct. I accept that there is no suggestion that the offender was in any way involved in some commercial operation and the facts concerning the offender’s arrest clearly point in exactly the opposite direction. There is no evidence that the likely recipients of the drugs which the offender had on him at the time of his arrest were in any way vulnerable. It appears to be likely that the ecstasy and the cocaine were for personal consumption rather than for supply.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was only recently committed for sentence. It has been submitted by counsel for the offender that there was an early plea of guilty and nothing was submitted to the contrary by the Crown. The offender has expressed remorse and regret but, as is pointed out in the presentence report, the offender appears to be ashamed and remorseful because of his being about to be convicted. However the reasons related more to the impact on him and his family rather than what the Court traditionally looks at, which is victim empathy. However, it may be difficult to have victim empathy when those to whom the drugs may have been supplied were expecting to use them and might have no adverse consequence from using them. However, it must always be borne in mind that people who pass drugs on carry with them the ability to introduce others to illicit drugs and to commence others down the path that can lead to personal ruin.
	
	
	I am also asked to take into account the offender’s relatively good character prior to these offences. The offender does have a short criminal history. He committed the offence of midrange PCA when he was 19 years old and in the following year was found to be in possession of a prohibited drug for which he was given a bond under s 10 to be of good behaviour for nine months. The offender told Mr Sorbello, and I am prepared to accept, though he was charged with having an empty satchel there were traces of cocaine in it in his pocket; that led to the s 10 bond. However, it does indicate that in 2009 the offender may have been taking cocaine in small amounts. That is quite consistent with the offender’s history which I have sought to recite.
	
	
	Shortly stated, everything for the future looks bright for this offender as far as the Court is concerned.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal has made it clear that a sentencing judge in exercising his or her sentencing discretion must not neglect the continuing rule or policy that a custodial sentence should generally be imposed for drug traffickers except in “exceptional circumstances”. The superior courts have also made it clear that there should not be an excessively liberal interpretation of the phrase “exceptional circumstances”. The question really for me is whether the current offender was involved in drug trafficking. Trafficking carries with it the connotation of supply on more than one occasion: R v Bardo (unreported, New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 14 July 1992) per Hunt CJ at CL. It has been held that trafficking does not involve “a limited or isolated event”: R v Ozer (unreported, New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, Hunt CJ at CL, Allen and Mathews JJ, 9 July 1993). More recently the former Chief Judge at Common Law, McClellan J said in R v Gip [2006] NSWCCA 115 at [13]:
	


“My understanding of these various statements is that where a finding can be made that an offender has engaged in repeated offences so that his or her activities can be described as trafficking, a fulltime custodial sentence should, unless there are exceptional circumstances, be imposed. However, if only one offence can be proved, but the circumstances surrounding that offence indicate that it was the result of a sophisticated commercial arrangement, the objective criminality involved may also require a custodial sentence, unless exceptional circumstances can otherwise be shown.”

Applying that dictum it is clear on the facts of the present case that there is no evidence of repeated offending by the current offender nor is there any evidence that the offence in which he was involved was part of a sophisticated commercial arrangement. Accordingly a fulltime custodial sentence is not necessarily required.


	
	However, the offence is a serious one. Again one must refer to the maximum penalty prescribed by Parliament. Illicit drugs ruin lives. The activity in which the offender was engaged had the potential to adversely affect other members of the community. The community demands that persons involved in supplying drugs be punished. I have confidence that personal deterrence is not of concern in the current sentencing exercise. I have no concern that Mr Jackson Barden needs to be deterred from again offending. I am confident that he realises what he has done is the result of a lifestyle which he has turned away from and which was potentially harmful or toxic. However general deterrence, that is the stopping or deterring others from engaging in the same sort of activity, is very important and is an essential part of the sentencing exercise. Persons must realise that if they take sufficient quantity of drugs to supply to others they may well find themselves in custody or at least in very serious trouble.
	
	
	The offender had in his possession 16 times the indictable quantity of this drug. He had in his possession one-third of the commercial quantity of the drug. A number of possible alternatives to fulltime custody have been explored in submissions on behalf of the parties. One is a Community Service Order. The offender is suitable to perform community service. However he could only do that on Sundays and that would have him working eight hours a day seven days a week, which is not in his interest and might doom him to failure in maintaining his resolve not to escape reality by turning to drugs. Another possibility has been a bond under s 9 to be of good behaviour for a term but such a bond may not carry with it sufficient general deterrence. The question of an Intensive Corrections Order has been raised but Corrective Services do not believe that the offender needs any assistance from them because he has done all that is necessary to put himself on the way to rehabilitation. Another avenue explored was home detention but that appears to me to be countermanded because, here, the offender has returned himself to the community, is working fulltime and advancing himself in his trade and in his work experience and has taken control of his own life. Locking himself, so to speak, inside his own home would lead to boredom and perhaps tempt him to turn to alcohol and/or drugs. In my view the only way of enforcing general deterrence and providing the current offender with the motivation which would keep him on the “straight and narrow” is to impose a sentence of imprisonment but to suspend that sentence pursuant to s 12.
	
	
	For more serious offences than these, I have started sentencing exercise with a head sentence of two years. For this offence I would commence with a head sentence of 16 months which I reduce to 12 months to acknowledge the utilitarian value of the offender’s plea of guilty at the earliest available opportunity: the maximum 25% discount for the utilitarian of that plea. In making that assessment I have also taken clearly into account the four matters on the Form 1.
	
	
	No-one wants any further reasons as distinct from orders?
	
	
	SFINAS: No.
	
	
	Jackson Keith Barden, on the charge that on 1 April 2015 at Woolooware in this State you did knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely 8.28 grams of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyethylamine in tablet form, you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment for a term of one year. Under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I order that execution of the sentence be suspended. I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for a term of one year commencing today. Conditions of the bond are as follows:
	



	
	you are to appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond;
	
	
	you are to be of good behaviour;
	
	
	you are to reside at [...], Grays Point in this State, or
	
	
	you are to advise the Registrar of the Court by prepaid registered post of any change of residential address during the term of the bond.
	
	
	you are to remain under the treatment of Mr Salvatore Sorbello, psychologist, until discharged from his care by him.
	


In passing that sentence I have taken into account the matters on the Form 1. I note that the matters under the s 166 certificate have been taken into account on the Form 1.


	
	Pursuant to the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989 I order that, pursuant to s 18(1), Australian cash in the sum of $200 found at Woolooware Railway Station on 1 April 2015 be forfeited to the Crown. I grant leave pursuant to s 9(3) par (a) that the property forfeited by the order be disposed of forthwith.
	
	
	Any other orders sought?
	
	
	SFINAS: Drug destruction.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I order the drugs be destroyed. Any other orders sought?
	
	
	SFINAS: No.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Barden, you will need to go to the Registry which is back in the Downing Centre next door to sign the bond.
	
	
	PICKIN: I’ll have one of my instructors take him, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes, make sure it happens quickly because they like to go home. So do we all.

		23 May 2016",2015-12-01 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768334,R v Stewart & R v Wilmot [2015] NSWDC 378,"Sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: I know it is stating the obvious, but not all of us have the same lives as each other. Some have very sad lives. Unfortunately, often that sadness primarily results from the circumstance that many children are sexually abused by people who should look after them. Of recent times more attention has been paid to the consequences for individual children of them being sexually abused. Such consequences are serious and ongoing. One can quite understand why a person who has been sexually abused as a child might want to escape reality from time to time. A common way of doing precisely that is to use drugs, and so we often have appearing for sentence in these Courts sad adults whose drug use began in the context of sexual abuse.
	
	
	Appearing for sentence today are two offenders with such backgrounds, Karl Stewart and Leigh Wilmot. Both of them have pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to an offence of armed robbery.
	
	
	The offence was committed in the early hours of 16 April 2015. A console operate at a 7‑Eleven service station in Mayfield was working alone. The offenders went into the store after being let in by the victim, Mr Ahmad. Once inside Mr Stewart produced a knife. He lent over the counter and lunged at the victim, pointing the knife at him. He said, “Cash”, which of course caused Mr Ahmad to open the till, take out the cash and put it onto the counter. Mr Stewart began to put the cash into a bag that he had brought with him. He tipped the coins into the same bag, but he wanted more. He said to Mr Ahmad, “Smokes”. Mr Ahmad then began to give cigarettes to Mr Stewart. It appears that during this time Mr Wilmot was not really doing much at all apart from standing there perhaps ready to assist. He did help Mr Stewart open the bag that the cigarettes went into, but did not say anything at all to Mr Ahmad.
	
	
	Having obviously terrified Mr Ahmad, the offenders left the store. All they got was $305 in cash and $150 worth of cigarettes. That they were prepared to do what they did for such a small return is testament to one of the problems that judges have to deal with on a regular basis. Vulnerable victims such as Mr Ahmad are regarded as soft targets and drug users such as Mr Wilmot and Mr Stewart often at times think nothing of terrifying such vulnerable people for very small returns indeed.
	
	
	Fortunately, these offenders were identified when a person whom they knew reported matters to police. The offender Stewart told her what he had done and, she told police what she had been told. The offenders were arrested. Both of them made immediate admissions to police. As I have mentioned, they pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and they are thus entitled to a discount of 25 per cent from the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed.
	
	
	Of course, during submissions attention was focused on the R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R guideline judgment. The common offence postulated in that judgment is quite appropriate to these offenders before me today, with some differences; these pleas were early, not the late pleas contemplated in Henry, Mr Wilmot cannot be described as young and it is an aggravating feature beyond the Henry guideline that the offence was committed in company.
	
	
	I will return now to the sad backgrounds of both of the offenders. Mr Wilmot was placed into foster care at a very young age due to his parents’ inability to care for him. In fact he has only ever met his mother once. There are many foster carers in society who are kind and do an admirable job bringing up children in their care, but Mr Wilmot’s experience with foster care was not one of those. He was moved from place to place and was physically abused on some occasions as well as being sexually abused on around 20 occasions by one of his male foster carers. Some of his other foster carers treated him very badly. He recalled one placement where he was put into an underground cellar in a foster carer’s house for up to a week and fed only bread and water as a means of punishment. On top of that some of his foster carers introduced drugs to him at the age of only about nine.
	
	
	Not surprisingly given those circumstances, Mr Wilmot began to abscond from foster care placements and began to live on the streets. He told the author of a psychological report tendered today that, “The streets were always there for me. They never let me down.” At one stage he did manage to locate his biological mother, but that did not go well either. Mr Wilmot found it very confronting to contemplate why it was that he had been given up for foster care whereas his siblings had not been.
	
	
	The psychological report notes that Mr Wilmot has been a chronic poly-substance user since he was nine years of age, reporting that his chronic use of substances has been a means of self-medication to deal with his difficult and traumatic childhood.
	
	
	As I began these remarks on sentence, when a life is as unhappy as Mr Wilmot’s early life was one can more easily forgive a desire to blank it out and escape reality through drug use. In fact given Mr Wilmot’s background one might have expected him to have a more significant criminal history than he does. There is an offence of larceny in 2001 and then a significant gap until there were offences of common assault, possessing a prohibited drug and some driving offences in 2012 to 2015.
	
	
	The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Henry not only deals with a guideline judgment for armed robbery, but also deals with the circumstances in which drug use can be a mitigating factor. Usually the use of drugs is not a mitigating factor. After all, every time a person uses drugs that is ordinarily a matter of personal choice, but some exceptions to that general rule were contemplated, where it could not really be said that a person exercised a personal choice to begin to use drugs, such as when such drug use began at an early age. I am thus satisfied that in Mr Wilmot’s case, and indeed in Mr Stewart’s case which I will explain when I get to it, it is a mitigating factor that this offence was committed whilst under the influence of drugs, such drug abuse being a long-standing issue for Mr Wilmot arising from his background as I have explained it.
	
	
	Mr Wilmot has a history of having worked in the past and indeed has been a volunteer for the State Emergency Service. He has been able to abstain from at least the harder drugs at times and indeed this offence came after what was for him a significant period of abstinence from methylamphetamine, although he did admit that he continued to use cannabis. He does have reasonable prospects for rehabilitation although, given that his drug addiction is long-standing, no-one would suggest that the prospect of Mr Wilmot giving up drugs easily is a likely one.
	
	
	Mr Wilmot expressed his remorse. I am satisfied that it was genuine. Perhaps the best indication of the hope for Mr Wilmot’s future is that this offence is very much out of character for him.
	
	
	He is now 38 years of age and this is his first time in custody. It is to be hoped that this more serious breach of the criminal law is very much a one off.
	
	
	I make a finding of special circumstances in his favour. They relate to the circumstance that his drug use is related to his childhood trauma and that this is his first time in custody. On the other hand, offences such as these are distressingly prevalent. As I mentioned before, people such as Mr Ahmad are easy targets and general deterrence requires that a substantial custodial sentence be imposed.
	
	
	Of course the principle of parity applies to these two offenders. Neither of them should have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence I impose upon him with the sentence that I impose upon the other. In that regard it is important to remember the various roles played by the offenders.
	
	
	The statement of facts tendered in each case tends to suggest that Mr Stewart was the leader and Mr Wilmot was the follower and indeed Mr Wilmot gave evidence along those lines in court today. He was not challenged on his evidence by counsel for Mr Stewart. In addition there is nothing to suggest that I should not accept Mr Wilmot’s evidence that since going into gaol for about seven months now he has not used drugs at all, this being the longest period of his life when he has not used drugs.
	
	
	On the other hand, Mr Stewart does have some misconduct charges on his custodial history including one for possession of drugs. There is another one for administration of drugs, but Mr Stewart said he had not actually got around to using the drugs. Although I do have to note that at least one of the misconduct charges arose in circumstances where Mr Stewart damaged a towel because he intended to hang himself with it.
	
	
	In Mr Stewart’s case, he was sexually abused by his step-father. His step-father came into his life after his father and his mother separated. He said, and I accept, that he was sexually abused by his step-father from the age of six to the age of 13 when, in response to his complaints of such sexual abuse not being believed, he left home. Since then he too has lived on the streets, keeping in touch with his mother from time to time. He would sleep on park benches, trains and the like and fended for himself from a very young age. Apart from six months living with an uncle, he has been effectively by himself since he was 13. His drug use also began at an early age; 13 years in his case.
	
	
	He has plans for the future. He is father to four young children and wants to get cleaned up so he can play the role of a father to his children. He has made enquiries about residential rehabilitation at Bennelong’s Haven. He has been accepted, but understands that he will not be in a position to take up that placement until he is released from custody.
	
	
	He too expressed his remorse and I again accept that it was genuine. In common with Mr Wilmot, he was using drugs to escape reality. He had built up a drug debt. His decision to deal with that development by committing an armed robbery is of course a serious criminal one, but once again this was a departure from what his criminal history suggests is how he otherwise would act.
	
	
	I make a finding of special circumstances in his favour as well, for the same reasons as I did in Mr Wilmot’s case. The link between this offence and his childhood trauma is obvious and again this will be his first time in custody.
	
	
	Overriding everything I have said is the need to impose a sentence which reflects the objective gravity of each of the offender’s conduct. That does require significant periods in gaol.
	
	
	In Mr Stewart’s case I impose a sentence of imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of 18 months and a head sentence of three years to date from 20 April 2015, thus the non-parole period will expire on 19 October 2016 on which day the offender is to be released to parole. It is a condition of his release to parole that he enter into a residential rehabilitation facility. His further conditions of parole are that he accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and obey all their reasonable directions as regards drug rehabilitation, courses, counselling and the like.
	
	
	In Mr Wilmot’s case I sentence him to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of 15 months and a head sentence of two and a half years to date from 20 May 2015. His non-parole period will expire on 19 August 2016 on which day he is to be released to parole. It is a condition of his parole that he be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service and obey all their reasonable directions regarding drug rehabilitation, courses, counselling and the like.

2768340,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Colakoglu; Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Dodd; Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Whitby; Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v EC [2015] NSWCCA 301,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Johnson J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: These four appeals, which were heard together, are brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (“the Director”) under s.92(4) Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989 (“the 1989 Confiscation Act”) against the refusal of an application in each case under s.13(2)(b) of that Act for drug proceeds orders (in the quantum sought by the Director) at the Sydney District Court on 28 March 2014 in relation to the Respondents, Aydin Colakoglu, Joel Anthony Dodd, Mitchell Whitby and EC.
	
	
	Several issues are raised by these appeals:
	



	
	the nature and scope of an appeal by the Director under s.92(4) of the 1989 Confiscation Act;
	
	
	the correct approach to determination of an application for a drug proceeds order under the 1989 Confiscation Act;
	
	
	whether error is demonstrated on the part of the District Court Judge in the approach taken with respect to the applications in these cases;
	
	
	if error is demonstrated, what order or orders should be made by this Court.
	



	
	Before moving to consideration of these issues, the factual background to the appeals should be outlined.
	


Factual Background


	
	Police investigations conducted by Strikeforce Pryce established that each of the Respondents was a participant in a drug supply enterprise.
	


Respondent Colakoglu


	
	The Respondent Colakoglu was arrested on 27 March 2012 in relation to his involvement in drug supply.
	
	
	After pleading guilty in the Local Court, the Respondent Colakoglu came before his Honour Judge Lakatos SC for sentence on 1 November 2013. He pleaded guilty to one count alleging that, between 21 February 2012 and 27 March 2012, he supplied a large commercial quantity of MDMA (1,274.2 grams) contrary to s.25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (“DMT Act”). This was a rolled up charge combining actual sales.
	
	
	To be taken into account on a Form 1 was an offence that, on 25 January 2012, he supplied a commercial quantity of MDMA (298.7 grams). This offence involved possession for the purpose of supply.
	
	
	During the course of the sentencing proceedings concerning the Respondent Colakoglu, reference was made to the fact that a confiscation application would be brought with respect to him at a later time.
	
	
	On 14 November 2013, the Respondent Colakoglu was sentenced for the s.25(2) DMT Act offence, taking into account the Form 1 offence, to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years and three months commencing on 27 March 2012 and expiring on 26 June 2016, with a balance of term of three years and three months commencing on 27 June 2016 and expiring on 26 September 2019.

Respondent Whitby


	
	The Respondent Whitby was arrested on 1 May 2012.
	
	
	As with the other Respondents, following pleas of guilty in the Local Court, the Respondent Whitby came before his Honour Judge Lakatos SC and reference was made during the sentencing proceedings to a confiscation application to proceed at a later time.
	
	
	The Respondent Whitby pleaded guilty to the following offences:
	



	
	Count 1 - Between 20 January 2012 and 7 March 2012, supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of MDMA (1.182.56 kilograms) (a rolled-up charge arising from actual sales).
	
	
	Count 2 - Between 15 December 2011 and 22 March 2012, supplying the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (807.8 grams).
	
	
	Count 3 - Between 28 January and 5 march 2012, supplying an indictable quantity of methorphan (72.1 grams) (a rolled-up charge arising from two actual sales and a free sample supplied).
	



	
	In passing sentence on Count 1, the sentencing Judge took into account, on a Form 1, an offence of supplying ecstasy (0.59 grams in the form of two tablets).
	
	
	On 29 August 2013, the Respondent Whitby was sentenced as follows:
	



	
	Count 1 - Imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years and three months commencing on 1 November 2012 and expiring on 31 January 2017, with a balance of term of three years and three months commencing on 1 February 2017 and expiring on 30 April 2020.
	
	
	Count 2 - Imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years commencing on 1 May 2012 and expiring on 30 April 2015, with a balance of term of one year commencing on 1 May 2015 and expiring on 30 April 2016.
	
	
	Count 3 - A fixed term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 1 May 2012 and expiring on 30 April 2014.
	



	
	The total effective sentence imposed on the Respondent Whitby was one of imprisonment for eight years including a non-parole period of four years and nine months. On 29 May 2015, this Court dismissed an appeal by the Respondent Whitby against sentence: Whitby v R [2015] NSWCCA 124.
	
	
	Each of the Respondents was sentenced for “drug trafficking offences” for the purpose of ss. 4(1), 13(2) and 29(1) of the 1989 Confiscation Act.
	


The Confiscation Applications Concerning the Respondents


	
	The hearing of the confiscation applications concerning the Respondents proceeded on 31 January 2014 and 28 February 2014.
	
	
	With respect to the Respondent Colakoglu, the Director made application for a drug proceeds order under s.13(2)(b) of the 1989 Confiscation Act in the sum of $65,000.00 in respect of benefits said to have been derived by the Respondent from the commission of drug trafficking offences. On 28 February 2014, the Director revised this figure and pressed a claim in the sum of $39,000.00.
	
	
	Concerning the Respondent Dodd, the Director made applications for:
	



	
	forfeiture of cash under s.13(2)(a) in the sum of $2,715.00; and
	
	
	a drug proceeds order under s.13(2)(b), in respect of benefits said to have been derived by the Respondent from the commission of drug trafficking offences, in the sum of $40,400.00.
	



	
	With respect to the Respondent EC, the Director applied for:
	



	
	forfeiture of cash under s.13(2)(a) in the sum of $405.00;
	
	
	a drug proceeds order under s.13(2)(b), in respect of benefits said to have been derived by the Respondent from the commission of drug trafficking offences, in the sum of $90,900.00 - on 28 February 2014, the Director revised this claim and pressed for an order in the sum of $64,300.00.
	



	
	With respect to the Respondent Whitby, the Director made application for a drug proceeds order under s.13(2)(b), in respect of benefits said to have been derived by him from the commission of drug trafficking offences, in the sum of $85,144.00.
	
	
	At the hearing of the confiscation applications, the Director relied upon affidavits of Gina Mitchell sworn on 11 July 2013 (Colakoglu), 11 July 2013 (Whitby), 7 August 2013 (EC) and 31 October 2013 (Dodd). These affidavits included statements made for the purposes of ss. 31 and 31A of the 1989 Confiscation Act.
	


The Decision and Orders Made by the District Court


	
	Put shortly, the Director had calculated the sum claimed by way of a drug proceeds order in each case by reference to the sum paid as a sale price by an undercover police officer to the particular persons supplying the drugs.
	
	
	Again put shortly, the submission advanced for the Respondents in the District Court was that the sum to be provided for, in each drug proceeds order, should be calculated by reference to the monetary sum actually derived by the particular person. In effect, his Honour accepted the construction of the provisions advanced for the Respondents.
	
	
	His Honour’s judgment referred to the Notices of Motion giving rise to the claims, and then turned to various provisions contained in the 1989 Confiscation Act. After referring to ss.4, 17, 18 and 29, his Honour observed (page 4, Judgment, 28 March 2014):
	


“Just pausing there it is clear by reference to the objects of the Act that the Act seeks to denude those who have committed any drug trafficking offences of the benefits they have derived from such activity.”


	
	His Honour then turned to consider the terms of s.30 of the 1989 Confiscation Act and the decision of this Court in R v Hall [2013] NSWCCA 47; 227 A Crim R 544. His Honour summarised the approach to calculation adopted by the Director in the following way (page 7):
	


“In short compass what is clear is that the value of the benefits derived in Ms Mitchell's affidavit, and that is the position which the Crown argued for, involved an assessment of the sale price usually to the undercover officer involved in the operation in its entirety.”


	
	With respect to the claims mentioned at [29](a) and [30](a) above, his Honour made forfeiture orders in the sums claimed concerning the Respondent Dodd ($2,715.00) and EC ($405.00). Those orders are not the subject of controversy before this Court.
	
	
	His Honour outlined the relevant facts in the following way (pages 7-8):
	


“The facts in relation to Mr Colakoglu included the following statements: ‘The offender would make $1 to $2 profit per pill.’ Thereafter without going through it specifically the total profit assessed to have been made as known by Mr Colakoglu was said to have been $8,000. That was in the facts contained in the sentencing documents. One can see that the total profit of $8,000 (known) is significantly different from the maximum total of $65,000.

Similarly Mr Whitby's supporting affidavit, that of Ms Mitchell, in support of the $85,144 in his case the facts read that the total amount known of the profit that he made in the various drug transactions he was involved in was $3,000 although the purchase price and the price paid to the undercover officer was something to the extent of $50,000. Similarly Mr Dodd, again I will not go specifically through these, but Mr Dodd's position is relatively similar as is the position of [EC].”


	
	In the course of explaining his reasons for rejecting the Director’s approach to the application for drug proceeds orders, his Honour said (page 9-11):
	


“Moving then to the more problematical area of the derivation of benefits in relation to each. As I have said the principal objects of the Act are to deprive persons of benefits derived from the commission of drug offences. I have indicated by reference to the Act and the statements of McClellan J [in R v Hall] the three step procedure the Court needs to be involved in. The second matter, the assessment of benefits, is to be undertaken by having regard to the information before the Court concerning the matters set out in s 30(1). As I have said relevantly s 30(6) provides in assessing the value of the proceeds of drug trafficking any expenses or outgoings of the defendant in connection with the commission of the offence must not be deducted.

The Crown has based its argument that the entire purchase price or sale price of each of the drugs constituted the benefits derived by each of the offenders on a proposition that this provision, s 30(6), mandated that there should be no deduction of expenses or outgoings from the purchase price and the cost price to the offender was properly to be construed as an expense or outgoing. If this construction were true an amount of a drug, for example of a value of $10,000, which passed through the hands of a number of connected co-offenders the effect would be that the Crown would be enabled to seek forfeiture orders of many multiples of the actual value of one lot of drugs. It is difficult to accept that the legislature intended that the community profit many times over from the commission of an offence as opposed to taking away any, if I might put it this way, legitimate proceeds of crime from an offender. Indeed, it should fairly be noted that so far as at least Mr Colakoglu, Mr Whitby and Mr Dodd are concerned, and it may also apply to [EC], the value of the same amount of drugs has been claimed from each of them. A close analysis of the statements supporting the forfeiture orders indicate that the same amount of drugs had been made the subject of the claim for cost price for all of those offenders. In my opinion that cannot be, as a matter of common sense at least, the proper construction of this Act.

In any event, as I have earlier observed s 30 deals with the manner in which the benefit is to be assessed and does not in terms reflect upon the question of whether any benefit was derived. In my opinion if the evidence is reliable and clear that a person has paid for example X dollars for drugs and sold those drugs for X plus one dollars, on any reasonable construction the benefit derived by that person is one dollar not X dollars or X plus one dollars. That of course is based upon a full knowledge of the facts but in my view that construction must be correct. I accept that the Court of Criminal Appeal authorities have indicated that courts are often called upon to make decisions about these matters on less than complete information and accordingly reasonable estimates need to be made. Where the evidence is not reliable of an amount of profit made by a person it may be legitimate to treat the purchase price as the benefit derived, or for that matter the sale price.   

However, in the present case the Crown has approached the task in respect of these offenders, in my view, inconsistently in the sense that in some cases it has been prepared to accept that the profit alone constitutes the benefit whereas in other instances it is fixed upon the purchase price of the drug in question. It is not immediately clear why the judgment was made in the former case, that is to say where the evidence was reliable and hence justified a lesser figure. In other words, not much argument was directed towards why profit was chosen in relation to one instance and purchase price or sale price in another.

Generally, in my view, if there is reliable evidence supporting a proposition that the profit made by an offender was the amount he or she made from the sale of the drug and the amount was but a percentage of the purchase price the benefit that the offender derived was the profit and not the purchase price.”


	
	A little later, his Honour summarised the approach adopted to the applications in the following way (pages 11-12):
	


“Having gone through both the facts and the evidence in support of the confiscation orders it appears to me as a general proposition that the Crown has been prepared to accept on a number of occasions that where pills were on-sold usually to the undercover officer but I have extrapolated this to instances where such a person was not the ultimate consumer, that the range of profit was indeed between $1 or $2 per pill. In my view, if that is to be accepted for the purposes of sentencing I see no reason why I should not rely upon that as a basis upon which to deal with confiscation matters.

Let me say what I have done in terms of how I have applied all these considerations. In my view the proper procedure is to discern the profit where it is accepted by both sides to be profit. Secondly, I think it is also legitimate and in accordance with the Act to deduct from the assessment any amount of drugs that the relevant offender had in his possession at the time he or she was arrested. In my view the best that can be discerned from that is that they have either paid for that from somebody else or owe somebody else for that amount of drug but they have not yet come into moneys and/or benefits because it has not been sold.

Secondly, there were a number of instances in the present case where samples appear to have been given away by various of the offenders to usually the undercover officer. In my view, on no view could that be a benefit derived or at least I do not know how to assess the goodwill which one might argue that was designed to achieve. I put that out of my consideration.

Finally, I take out of consideration any moneys recovered from the various offender's homes, which in my view must be deducted from any benefit derived. Those are then the formulas that I have applied to reach these results.”


	
	Applying this approach to the applications, his Honour made drug proceeds orders in the following amounts:
	



	
	Respondent Colakoglu - $5,890.00.
	
	
	Respondent Dodd - $8,712.00.
	
	
	Respondent EC - $12,740.00.
	
	
	Respondent Whitby - $13,636.00.
	


Relevant Provisions of the 1989 Confiscation Act

The Appeal Provision


	
	Section 92 of the 1989 Confiscation Act provides for appeals, including appeals by the Director under s.92(4). The section states:
	


“92    Appeals

(1)    Without affecting any other right of appeal, a forfeiture order in relation to any property is appellable by any person who has an interest in the property:

(a)    in the case of a person convicted of an offence in reliance on which the forfeiture order was made - as if the order were, or were part of, a sentence imposed in respect of the offence, or

(b)    in any other case - as if the person had been convicted of a serious offence and the order were, or were part of, a sentence imposed in respect of the offence.

(2)    Without affecting any other right of appeal, a pecuniary penalty order or drug proceeds order is appellable as if it were, or were part of, a sentence imposed in respect of the offence in relation to which the order was made.

(3)    On appeal, a forfeiture order, pecuniary penalty order or drug proceeds order may be confirmed, discharged or varied.

(4)    The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against a refusal by a court to make a drug proceeds order, forfeiture order, pecuniary penalty order or restraining order, and the Court of Criminal Appeal may in its discretion make such order as could have been made in the first instance.

(5)    A drug proceeds order, forfeiture order, pecuniary penalty order or restraining order made by the Court of Criminal Appeal under subsection (4) shall be taken to have been made by the Supreme Court under this Act, but is not on that account subject to further appeal.”

The Proceeds of Crime Provisions


	
	The principal objects of the 1989 Confiscation Act appear in s. 3:
	


“3 Principal objects

The principal objects of this Act are:

(a)  to deprive persons of the proceeds of, and benefits derived from, the commission of offences against certain laws of the State, and

(c)  to enable law enforcement authorities effectively to trace such proceeds, benefits and property, and

(d)  to provide for the enforcement in the State of forfeiture orders, pecuniary penalty orders and restraining orders made in respect of offences against the laws of other States.”


	
	Several terms relevant to this appeal are defined in s. 4:
	


“4 Definitions

(1)  In this Act:

…

benefit includes service and advantage.

(a)  a benefit derived, directly or indirectly, by the person, and

(b)  a benefit derived, directly or indirectly, by another person at the request or direction of the first person.”


	
	Section 13 is in the following terms:
	


“13    Applications for confiscation orders

(b)    necessary evidence became available only after the first application was determined, or

(c)    the Court is otherwise satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to grant the leave.”


	
	Division 4 (ss.28-31A) provides for the making of drug proceeds orders. Those sections are in the following terms:
	


“28    Application of Division

This Division applies to proceeds of a drug trafficking offence that come into the possession of a person either before or after the commencement of this Division.

29    Drug proceeds orders

(1)    If an application is made for a drug proceeds order against a person (in this Division called the defendant) convicted of a drug trafficking offence, the court must:

(a)    determine whether the defendant has derived any benefit in connection with drug trafficking at any time, and

(b)    if the court believes the defendant has so benefited, assess the value of any such benefit, and

(c)    order the defendant to pay to the State a pecuniary penalty equal to the amount so assessed.

(2)    If:

(a)    property that is the proceeds of drug trafficking has been forfeited under this Act or a law of the Commonwealth, a Territory or another State, or

(b)    a forfeiture order is proposed to be made against property that is proceeds of drug trafficking,

the pecuniary penalty to be made is taken to be reduced by an amount equal to the value of the property as at the time of the making of the forfeiture order.

(3)    If:

(a)    a court makes an order under this section in relation to an offence, and

(b)    in calculating the penalty amount, the court took into account a proposed forfeiture order in respect of property, and

(c)    an appeal against the forfeiture order is allowed or the proceedings for the proposed forfeiture order terminate without the proposed forfeiture order being made,

an appropriate officer may apply to the court for a variation of the order to increase the penalty amount by the value of the property and the court may, if it considers it appropriate to do so, vary the order accordingly.

(4)    An amount payable by a defendant to the State in accordance with an order made under this section is, for all purposes, taken to be a civil debt due by the defendant to the State.

(5)    An order made by a court under this section may be enforced as if it were an order made by the court in civil proceedings instituted by the State against the defendant to recover a debt due by the person to the State.

30    Assessment of proceeds of drug trafficking

(1)    A court is to assess the benefits (if any) derived in connection with drug trafficking by having regard to information before the court concerning all or any of the following matters:

(a)    the money, or the value of property other than money, that came into the possession or control of the defendant, or another person at the request or by the direction of the defendant, at any time in connection with drug trafficking by the defendant,

(b)    the value of any benefit that was provided for the defendant, or for another person at the request or direction of the defendant, in respect of the defendant’s involvement or participation in a public promotion relating to drug trafficking (or such part of the value of the benefit as is commensurate with the proportion of the defendant’s involvement or participation that is concerned with drug trafficking),

(c)    the value of any benefit, other than a benefit of a kind referred to in paragraph (a) or (b), that was provided for the defendant, or another person at the request or by the direction of the defendant, because of drug trafficking by the defendant,

(d)    the market value, at the time of the drug trafficking, of substances similar or substantially similar to the prohibited drug or prohibited plant involved in the drug trafficking offence or offences,

(e)    the amount that was, or the range of amounts that were, ordinarily paid for the doing of an act or thing similar or substantially similar to the doing of the act or thing constituting the drug trafficking,

(f)    the value of the defendant’s property appearing to the court:

(i)    to have been held by the defendant at any time since his or her conviction, or

(ii)    to have been transferred to the defendant at any time since the beginning of the period of 6 years that ended when the proceedings were instituted against the defendant,

(g)    the value of the defendant’s income and expenditure:

(i)    at any time since his or her conviction, or

(ii)    at any time since the beginning of the period of 6 years that ended when the proceedings were instituted against the defendant.

(2)    In considering whether to treat a benefit of the kind referred to in subsection (1) (b) as a benefit derived in connection with drug trafficking, a court may have regard to any matter that it thinks fit, including the public interest and any research, educational or rehabilitative purpose of the public promotion concerned.

(3)    If evidence is given that the value of the defendant’s property or the defendant’s income or expenditure:

(a)    after the defendant committed drug trafficking offences, or

(b)    during and after the end of the period of 6 years that ended when proceedings for the drug trafficking offences were last instituted against the defendant,

exceeded the value of the defendant’s property or income or expenditure before the defendant committed the drug trafficking offences or before the commencement of that period then the court must treat the value of the benefits derived by the defendant because of drug trafficking by the defendant as being not less than the amount of the excess.

(4)    Subsection (3) does not apply to the whole or a part of the excess referred to in that subsection if the defendant satisfies the court that it was due to causes unrelated to drug trafficking or the commission of other serious offences.

(5)    For the purposes of assessing the value of the proceeds of drug trafficking in a case where a drug proceeds order has previously been made against the defendant, the court must leave out of account any of the defendant’s proceeds of drug trafficking that are shown to the court:

(a)    to have been taken into account in determining the amount to be recovered in respect of drug trafficking under a previous drug proceeds order or pecuniary penalty order, or

(b)    to have been recovered under an order made under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990.

(6)    In assessing the value of the proceeds of drug trafficking of a defendant convicted of a drug trafficking offence or offences, any expenses or outgoings of the defendant in connection with the commission of the offence or offences must not be deducted.

(7)    This section applies to and in relation to property that comes into the possession or under the control of a person either within or outside New South Wales, and to benefits that are provided for a person either within or outside New South Wales.

31    Statements relating to drug trafficking

(1)    If:

(a)    there is tendered to a court by the prosecution a statement as to any matters relevant to determining whether the defendant has benefited from drug trafficking or to the assessment of the value of the defendant’s proceeds of drug trafficking, and

(b)    the defendant accepts to any extent any allegation in the statement,

the court may, for the purposes of that determination and assessment, treat the defendant’s acceptance as conclusive of the matters to which it relates.

(2)    If:

(a)    a statement is tendered under subsection (1) (a), and

(b)    the court is satisfied that a copy of that statement has been served on the defendant,

the court may require the defendant to indicate to what extent the defendant accepts each allegation in the statement and, so far as the defendant does not accept any such allegation, to indicate any matters the defendant proposes to rely on.

(3)    If the defendant fails in any respect to comply with a requirement under subsection (2), the defendant may be treated for the purposes of this section as accepting every allegation in the statement apart from:

(a)    any allegation in respect of which the defendant has complied with the requirement, and

(b)    any allegation that the defendant has benefited from drug trafficking or that any benefit was derived by the defendant in connection with drug trafficking carried on by the defendant or another.

(4)    (Repealed)

(5)    An allegation may be accepted or a matter indicated for the purposes of this section either:

(a)    orally before the court, or

(b)    in writing in accordance with the rules of court.

(6)    No acceptance by the defendant under this section that any benefit was derived by the defendant in connection with drug trafficking carried on by the defendant or another shall be admissible in evidence in any proceedings for an offence.

(7)–(9) (Repealed)

31A    Evidence as to value of drugs and other matters

(1)    In proceedings for an application for a drug proceeds order, a member of the NSW Police Force, a member of the Australian Federal Police or a Customs officer may give evidence (whether in person or in a statement tendered to the court by the prosecution under this Division):

(a)    as to the market value, at the time of a drug trafficking offence in relation to a substance, or substantially similar substances, and

(b)    as to the amount, or the range of amounts, ordinarily paid for the doing of a similar or substantially similar act or thing to the offence.

(2)    The evidence may be given by a person who is experienced in the investigation of indictable offences under (or similar to offences under) the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.

(3)    Any such person may give evidence, to the best of his or her information, knowledge and belief:

(a)    as to the amount that was the market value of a prohibited drug or prohibited plant within the meaning of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 at a particular time or during a particular period, or

(b)    as to the amount, or the range of amounts, ordinarily paid at a particular time, or during a particular period, for the doing of an act or thing in relation to any such prohibited drug or prohibited plant,

despite any rule of law or practice relating to hearsay evidence and the testimony is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, evidence of the matter testified to.”

Competency of the Appeal


	
	Mr Dhanji SC, who appeared with Ms Burgess for the Respondents Dodd, Whitby and EC, advanced a submission challenging the competency of the Director’s appeal. Mr Brady, for the Respondent Colakoglu, joined in this submission.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Respondents that an appeal by the Director under s.92(4) of the 1989 Confiscation Act is confined to an appeal against a refusal to make a drug proceeds order. In this case, it was submitted, the District Court did not refuse to make an order. Rather, in each case, a drug proceeds order was made against the relevant Respondent, although not in the sum as sought by the Director.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Respondents that the right of appeal conferred by s.92(4) does not extend to an appeal against the quantum of a drug proceeds order as made. It was submitted that s.92(4) may be contrasted with the terms of s.92(1) and (2), which provide for a drug proceeds order to be appellable as is if it was part of a sentence.
	
	
	The Director submits that s.92(4) should be construed as if it said “appeal … against a refusal by a court to make a drug proceeds order in the amount sought” by the Director.
	
	
	In this respect, the Director relied upon the decision of this Court in R v Galek (1993) 70 A Crim R 252, in support of the proposition that s.92(4) permitted the Director to appeal against the making of an order in a lesser sum than that which was sought at first instance.
	
	
	In response to the Director’s submission based upon R v Galek, Mr Dhanji SC submitted orally that the Court should not follow that decision upon the basis that it is plainly wrong. It was submitted that this issue was dealt with briefly in R v Galek and submissions were developed before this Court in support of a contrary view.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Respondents that the Court should not fill the gap in s.92(4) by reading in the words “in the amount sought” at first instance. It was said that there was no warrant to read in words of this type: Taylor v The Owners - Strata Plan No. 11564 [2014] HCA 9; 253 CLR 531 at 548 [38]. This was particularly so, it was submitted, as the relevant legislation provides for the confiscation of property rights and should be strictly construed: Studman v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2007] NSWCCA 285; 177 A Crim R 34 at 40 [35]; Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Fysh [2013] NSWSC 81; 272 FLR 414 at 416-417 [10]-[12].
	


Decision


	
	As recognised by counsel for the Respondents, the decision of this Court in R v Galek supports the Director’s right to appeal under s.92(4) against a refusal by a court to make an order as sought at first instance by the Crown. So much was made clear in R v Galek by Allen J (at 255) and by Hunt CJ at CL (Mathews J agreeing) at 258.
	
	
	The precise nature of the statutory avenue of appeal to this Court depends upon the legislation in question: Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250 at 258-260 [17]-[21]; Turnbull v New South Wales Medical Board [1976] 2 NSWLR 281 at 297-298.
	
	
	It is noteworthy that the legislature has used what appears to be a restricted formula of words in s.92(4), namely an appeal against a refusal to make an order. That provision may be contrasted with the terms of s.92(1) and (2). It may be contrasted, as well, with other provisions providing for a Crown appeal against sentence: ss.5D, 5DA, 5DB and 5DC Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	It might be said that if the legislature had intended to provide for an appeal by the Director against an order (including quantum) as well as the refusal to make an order, it could have been expressed simply in these terms. This would be especially so given the operation of the provision in the area of confiscation of property.
	
	
	This Court should only depart from the decision in R v Galek if satisfied that the decision is clearly wrong: Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 490-491 [84]-[85]. For the Court to depart from a previous decision would require a strong conviction that the previous decision was incorrect: R v Arnold [1993] 30 NSWLR 73 at 85; Jimmy v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540 at 570 [127].
	
	
	Whilst recognising the arguments advanced for the Respondents in this respect, I am not persuaded that it has been demonstrated that the decision in R v Galek is clearly wrong.
	
	
	Accordingly, that decision should be followed and the challenge to the competency of the appeal should be rejected.
	


The Merits of the Appeal

The Director’s Submissions


	
	The Director submitted that the 1989 Confiscation Act, in the context of drug proceeds orders, is dealing with benefits and not profits. It was submitted that the clear intention of the legislation was that, when a person exchanges drugs for money, the amount of money received by the person is the benefit and the Court cannot reduce that amount by deducting any expenses or outgoings (having regard to s.30). Accordingly, the Director submits, the term “benefit” is the monetary amount received and not profits after the deduction of expenses.
	
	
	The Director submits that the distinction between “benefit” and “profit” is not new. Reference was made to the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Nieves (1991) 51 A Crim R 350 at 355-356 and the decision of the Supreme Court of Queensland (Shepherdson J) in Director of Public Prosecutions (Qld) v Raines (1995) 79 A Crim R 448 at 450-451.
	
	
	The Director referred to the decision of this Court in R v Fagher (1989) 16 NSWLR 67, in particular the judgment of Hunt J at 77.
	
	
	It was submitted that the primary Judge in this case adopted an approach which is contrary to s.30(6) of the 1989 Confiscation Act. It was submitted that his Honour erred in approaching the matter upon the basis of attempting to ascertain if reliable evidence existed as to the expenses and outgoings, for the purpose of reducing the amount constituting the benefit. It was submitted that such an approach is contrary to s.30(6) which makes clear that such outgoings and expenses are not to be deducted.
	
	
	The Director submitted that his Honour erred in law by deducting expenses and outgoings from the proceeds of drug sales in assessing the benefit. It was submitted, in respect of each matter, that once his Honour accepted the statements made under s.31 of the 1989 Confiscation Act as to the amount of money received by each Respondent as the proceeds of drug sales, it was incumbent on his Honour to assess the entire amount of the proceeds as the value of the benefit, and to make a drug proceeds order for that amount.
	


The Respondents’ Submissions


	
	It was submitted for the Respondents that the approach advanced by the Director would seek to extract from an offender a drug proceeds order which may exceed, by a considerable margin, the amount of any profit which the offender received from his or her crime. It was submitted that such an approach would breach the double jeopardy principle contained in s.20 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The Respondents submitted that assistance could be obtained from the long title of the 1989 Confiscation Act which referred to the confiscation of the “profits of crime”.
	
	
	The Respondents emphasised that the task to which s.30(6) is directed is “assessing the value of the proceeds of drug trafficking”. The concepts of “benefit” and “proceeds” are distinct, and are separately defined in s.4 of the 1989 Confiscation Act (see [44] above).
	
	
	The Respondents submitted that the inclusive definition of “benefit” does not attempt to alter the natural meaning of the word. It was noted that in Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Fysh, McCallum J observed (at 418[21]) that the ordinary meaning of the word “benefits” is “the good or gain received”.
	
	
	Accordingly, the Respondents submitted that it is apparent from this that the exercise required by s.29(1)(b), and the task to which s.30(6) is directed, are different.
	
	
	The Respondents accepted, however, that the assessment of the value of the “benefit” in s.29(1)(b) may be related to the assessment to the value of the “proceeds” in s.30(6). That is, an assessment of the former may require an assessment of the latter.
	
	
	The Respondents submitted that the focus of s.30(6) is on the particular “offence or offences” so that the “expenses and outgoings” are consequentially limited to, in the context of drug trafficking offences, matters related to the particular transaction. This will include, it was said, matters such as payments made to persons to deliver drugs and payments for transport associated with the delivery of the drugs. It did not include costs anterior to the particular offence.
	
	
	It was submitted that this construction presented no particular evidentiary difficulty with evidence being given regularly of the market place value of prohibited drugs, including the cost at both the wholesale and street value levels. It was submitted that such evidence is contemplated by s.30(1)(d).
	
	
	The Respondents submitted that this construction is consistent with other provisions of the 1989 Confiscation Act, including s.30(1)(f) and (g), s.30(3) and (4), in which the focus is on net gains.
	
	
	It was submitted that s.30(3), in its terms, requires an exercise to be undertaken by which the net gain is assessed as the “benefit” for the purposes of s.29(1). The “benefit” in s.29(1)(b) cannot take on different meanings dependent on which part of s.30 is utilised.
	
	
	Indeed, it was submitted for the Respondents that the Court may have approached the matter through s.30(3) in this case. Had this been done, the Court would have assessed the amount by which the particular Respondents’ property, after he committed the drug trafficking offences, exceeded the value of his property before he committed the offences. The Court would then have been entitled to “treat the value of the benefits derived by [the Respondent] as being not less than the amount of the excess”. The Respondents submit that this is, in effect, what was done here.
	
	
	The Respondents submit that the word “benefit” in s.29(1) means the net gain when calculated by the means permitted by s.30(3) and (4). The meaning of the term does not change as a result of being calculated by other means contemplated by s.30.
	
	
	The Respondents submit that the Director’s reliance on authorities dealing with other legislation provides limited assistance in this case. None of those authorities deal with the present question in the context of the 1989 Confiscation Act. It was submitted that none of those authorities involved a statutory scheme where a distinction is made between “proceeds” and “benefits” as in the 1989 Confiscation Act.
	
	
	That said, the Respondents submit that there is some support for their construction in these authorities. Reference was made to the decision of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand in R v Pedersen [1995] 2 NZLR 386 at 390, where the Court doubted that payment to a supplier is an expense or outgoing in connection with the commission of an offence of sale.
	
	
	The Respondents advanced an alternative construction, whereby accounting to another participant in the enterprise is not an expense or outgoing within s.30(6) of the 1989 Confiscation Act.
	
	
	It was submitted that an analysis of the facts in the present case demonstrates that the Respondents Whitby, Dodd and EC did not purchase drugs and then on-sell them for a profit. Rather, they received money for the drugs from the undercover officer and then accounted to each other for the supply of those drugs, retaining their share of the purchase price from the undercover officer and passing on the balance of that up the line. It was submitted that this accounting to another was not an “expense” or “outgoing” within the meaning of s.30(6).
	
	
	The Respondents relied upon the judgment of Pincus J in Cornwell v Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (1990) 24 FCR 544 at 562 and the judgment of Macrossan CJ in Re Ashworth (1992) 2 Qd R 459 at 467, with respect to the concept of “expenses or outgoings”.
	
	
	Reliance was placed upon the judgment of Wilcox J (Lockhart J agreeing) in Cornwell v Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police at 544-555 where his Honour observed that the “payment of monies to a partner, calculated by reference to the success of an enterprise, is a payment not ordinarily encompassed by the words ‘expenses or outgoings’”.
	
	
	It was submitted that, in the present cases, the objective of the Respondents was to supply the undercover officer with the drugs requested for an agreed price, with such drugs to be sourced up the line and supplied down the line for that purpose. Agreements in relation to the supply of those drugs between the Respondents were contingent on the payment by the undercover officer, and were not accounted for until after payment was made. Each Respondent shared the financial risk in that each was reliant on the money being paid by the undercover officer. Each retained a share of the purchase price, and handed on the balance to their supplier to take their share of the proceeds.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the Respondents submitted that the money handed up the line by each Respondent was not an “expense” or “outgoing” of the particular Respondent “in connection with the commission of the offence”. Accordingly, it was submitted, s.30(6) did not prevent that money being “deducted”.
	
	
	The Respondents submitted, contrary to the Director’s contention, that the primary Judge did not envisage two approaches to the assessment of benefit under the legislation. Rather, his Honour said no more than if the only evidence was the gross benefit, then the Court would have accepted that was the benefit. It was submitted that it was open to his Honour to observe that, when there was reliable evidence as to the net benefit, the Court was entitled to act on it.
	


Resolution of Competing Submissions


	
	It is for the Director to establish error on the part of the primary Judge. I am not persuaded that error has been demonstrated. In so concluding, I accept generally the submissions made for the Respondents.
	
	
	The relevant provisions of the 1989 Confiscation Act were considered most recently by this Court in R v Hall on a successful appeal by the Director against the (complete) refusal by a primary Judge to make a drug proceeds order. McClellan CJ at CL (Bellew and Button JJ agreeing) said at 553 [36]-[37]:
	


“36   … Section 29(1)(a) requires the court to determine whether a defendant has derived any benefit in connection with drug trafficking at any time. If the court believes that a defendant has so benefited it must assess the value of that benefit (s 29(1)(b)) and order the defendant to pay a pecuniary penalty equal to the amount so assessed: s 29(1)(c). The assessment is to be made having regard to the information before the Court as to the matters identified in s 30(1) including:

•   that the money came into the respondent's possession in connection with drug trafficking: s 30(1)(a); 

•   the value of any benefit provided for the respondent: s 30(1)(c); 

•   the market value of the drugs (s 30(1)(d)) disregarding any expenses as outgoings incurred by the respondent in connection with the commission of the offences: s 30(6).

37   This Court recognised in Fagher that the task of a court in carrying out the assessment required by the Act may prove difficult. Fagher was concerned with the Crimes (Confiscation of Profits) Act, which relevantly adopted the same formulation as in the Act, the court being required to make an assessment ""having regard to information before the court.""


	
	After referring further to R v Fagher, the Chief Judge at Common Law said in R v Hall at 554 [41]-[44]:
	


“41   In the present case the information before the court did not otherwise enable the precise amount of the benefit to the respondent from his drug trafficking to be assessed. However, the admissions made by the respondent, which I have previously related, clearly provided information from which an assessment could be made. His Honour should have made that assessment.

42   At first I was minded to order that the matter be remitted to the District Court for the appropriate assessment to be made. However having regard to the additional cost and inconvenience that would be involved I believe it appropriate that this Court exercise the power provided in s 92(4) of the Act and make the appropriate order.

43   From the available information it is apparent, and I would on the balance of probabilities conclude, that the respondent was trafficking to at least the extent of $70 per day for nearly twelve months (being the $50 of cannabis he smoked plus an additional sale of at least $20). Accepting that period to be eleven months, I would assess the benefit at 330 days at $70 per day being $23,100. From that sum $4,110 would have to be deducted making $18,990. An order reflecting this assessment should be made.

44   Before leaving the matter I should mention that the procedure provided by s 31 for the tender of statements by the prosecution from which an assessment of the benefit to an offender can be made would appear to be the preferable manner by which to prosecute this type of matter. By casting an onus upon the offender to respond, the court may be more comfortably able to make an assessment which must, of course, always be adverse to the interests of an offender. The procedure provided by s 31 appears to be that encouraged by Roden J in Fagher. Section 31A will also be of assistance to the prosecution in many cases.”


	
	The primary Judge approached the present applications in accordance with the three steps referred to in R v Hall at 553 [36] (see [88] above).
	
	
	The primary Judge had regard to the evidence, including the s.31 statements, for the purpose of determining whether drug proceeds orders should be made and, if so, in what amount. Upon the proper construction of s.30(6), I am satisfied that it was open to his Honour to approach the statutory task before him in the manner in which he did.
	
	
	The submission for the Respondents concerning the terms “benefit”, “proceeds” and “expenses or outgoings” in the statutory scheme (at [68]-[77] above) should be accepted.
	
	
	I accept the construction of the term “expenses or outgoings” advanced by the Respondents. This term is directed to a range of factors associated with a particular drug supply operation, such as payments made to persons to deliver drugs and payments made for transport hire associated with the delivery of the drugs. It does not extend, however, to the approach advocated by the Director on these appeals.
	
	
	It is pertinent that the long title of the 1989 Confiscation Act refers to confiscation of the “profits of crime”. The long title may be referred to as an aid to construction: Pearce and Geddes, “Statutory Interpretation in Australia”, LexisNexis Butterworths, 2014, 8th Edn, paragraph 4.48.
	
	
	The construction advanced by the Director would allow, in the case of several co-offenders, a windfall result where multiples of the same sum would be accumulated, and held referable to each particular offender, although the sum in question bore no relationship to what could be regarded as the proceeds of crime or actual benefit derived by that offender from the particular crime or crimes. I do not accept this approach.
	
	
	I do not consider that the conclusion reached in these appeals is inconsistent with the statements in authorities relied upon by the Director concerning the meaning of the term “benefit” in other legislation. Those cases did not involve circumstances, as present here, where the Director sought drug proceeds orders against multiple co-offenders using a process of double counting.
	
	
	The Respondent’s submission concerning double punishment must be approached with some care. Mr Dhanji SC noted s. 24B Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which states:
	


“24B      Confiscation of assets and forfeiture of proceeds of crime to be disregarded in sentencing

(1)     In sentencing an offender, the court must not take into account, as a mitigating factor in sentencing, the consequences for the offender of any order of a court imposed because of the offence under confiscation or forfeiture legislation.

(2)     In this section:

confiscation or forfeiture legislation means the following:

(a)     the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989,

(b)     the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990,

(c)     the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 of the Commonwealth,

(d)     any other law prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this definition.”


	
	Section 24B was introduced following a report of the NSW Sentencing Council. In the course of the second reading speech for the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2010, the Parliamentary Secretary, the Hon. Michael Veitch, said with respect to s. 24B (Hansard, Legislative Council, 23 November 2010):       “The [NSW Sentencing] Council was of the view that these orders are imposed to deny offenders the fruits of their crimes and this action should not be considered to be extra curial punishment that might lead to a sentence discount.”
	
	
	It is usually the case, as with the Respondents, that the Court imposes sentences, with the question of assessment of drug proceeds orders under the 1989 Confiscation Act to be considered at a later time.
	
	
	The construction advanced by the Director in this case would see the Respondents being deprived, by way of a drug proceeds order, of far more than “the fruits of their crimes”. It is at this point that the Respondent’s submission based upon the avoidance of double punishment may have some traction.
	
	
	The construction adopted by the primary Judge was open to him, and served to achieve the purpose of the 1989 Confiscation Act. His Honour undertook the process required by ss.29 and 30 of the 1989 Confiscation Act as explained in R v Hall.  With respect to each Respondent, his Honour:
	



	
	determined that the particular Respondent had derived a benefit in connection with drug trafficking;
	
	
	assessed the value of the benefit derived by the particular Respondent; and
	
	
	ordered the particular Respondent to pay to the State a pecuniary penalty equal to the amount as assessed.
	



	
	The findings made by the primary Judge were, in my view, open on the evidentiary material before the Court.
	
	
	The Director has not established error of law or fact on the part of the primary Judge in his approach to determination of the applications for drug proceeds orders against the Respondents.
	
	
	In these circumstances, no occasion arises for this Court to consider orders in substitution for those made in the District Court.
	


Conclusion and Proposed Orders


	
	The Director has failed to establish error on the part of the primary Judge in the determination of the application for a drug proceeds order against each Respondent.
	
	
	In these circumstances, I propose the following orders:
	



	
	the Director’s appeal with respect to the Respondent Colakoglu is dismissed;
	
	
	the Director’s appeal with respect to the Respondent Dodd is dismissed;
	
	
	the Director’s appeal with respect to the Respondent EC is dismissed;
	
	
	the Director’s appeal with respect to the Respondent Whitby is dismissed.
	



	
	R S HULME AJ: I agree with Johnson J.

		03 December 2015",2015-12-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2768346,Baleiovalau v R [2015] NSWCCA 305,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: On 2 December 2013 the applicant, Tomu Baleiovalau, pleaded not guilty to an indictment alleging an offence, contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), of attempted robbery while being armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a firearm, committed on 16 December 2004 at Regents Park (the 2004 offence).
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 25 years.
	
	
	Following a trial in the District Court before a judge alone (Lakatos SC DCJ), the applicant was found guilty on 28 July 2014.
	
	
	On 21 August 2014 the judge sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing from 11 April 2013. The earliest date the applicant is eligible for parole is 10 April 2016.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed on the following grounds:
	



	
	The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	The sentencing judge failed to give any meaningful effect to the principle of totality in the sentence that he imposed.
	
	
	The sentencing judge erred by undertaking a comparison between the objective and subjective circumstances in relation to Mr Taotala and the applicant when there was no proper basis to do so.
	
	
	The sentence was manifestly excessive.
	


Factual background


	
	The sentencing judge found the facts of the offending to be as follows.
	
	
	On 16 December 2004, the applicant and two other masked men entered the Commonwealth Bank at Regents Park at about mid-morning. The applicant's face was not covered. One of the applicant's co-offenders was holding a pistol and the other was holding a sledgehammer. The sledgehammer was used by one of the co-offenders on the windows of the tellers' area to gain entry. The offenders also attempted to gain entry to the tellers' area by the discharge of a shot from the pistol, which, by ricochet, caused a minor injury to the arm of a customer who was attending the bank at that time.
	
	
	A short time later, the offenders ran out of the bank, without any cash, and they were seen to drive off in a car, the licence plate of which was noted by several witnesses. The getaway car, a Nissan Silvia, was found a short time later. It contained articles of clothing on which the applicant's DNA was present. The clothing matched the description of that worn by one of the offenders as depicted in the CCTV footage of the attempted bank robbery (the Regents Park robbery).
	
	
	The applicant was first interviewed in relation to the Regents Park robbery in January 2008. He participated in a record of interview and denied any knowledge of the offences.
	
	
	The applicant was not arrested in relation to the 2004 offence until 6 May 2013. At that time he was serving a term of imprisonment in relation to other aggravated armed robbery offences, contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act, and an offence of conspiracy to commit aggravated armed robbery. Those offences were committed in the period February to April 2005 (the 2005 offences).
	


The alleged co-offender


	
	Mr John Taotala, an alleged co-offender in the Regents Park robbery, was also charged with the offence of aggravated attempted robbery. In addition, Mr Taotala was charged with an offence committed on 15 December 2004 involving the motor vehicle used in the Regents Park robbery. That offence involved the robbery of a Nissan Silvia motor vehicle whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	Mr Taotala pleaded not guilty to the indictment containing those charges and was tried jointly with the applicant before Lakatos SC DCJ. He was found not guilty of aggravated attempted robbery. Ultimately he was found guilty of armed robbery of the Nissan Silvia whilst armed with an offensive weapon, contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 20 years.
	
	
	On 21 August 2014, Lakatos SC DCJ sentenced Mr Taotala to a term of imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years.
	


The 2005 offences


	
	It is necessary to briefly refer to the 2005 offences and the sentences imposed upon the applicant, having regard to ground 2 of the appeal which relies upon the totality principle.
	
	
	On 24 January 2007 the applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment containing the 2005 offences.
	
	
	Count 1 concerned robbery in company involving approximately $40,005, the property of the Qantas Staff Credit Union Ltd, on 25 February 2005 at Hurstville, while armed with a dangerous weapon, being a shortened rifle (the Hurstville robbery). There were three co-offenders. They were all disguised, wearing scarves and caps and gloves. A sledgehammer was used to smash the glass window near the teller area. One of the offenders was armed with a sawn-off .22 rifle. He chased and threatened a customer with the rifle, who attempted to take his photo.
	
	
	Count 2 concerned the robbery in company involving two motor vehicles the property of Parkside Automobiles Pty Ltd on 12 April 2005 at Arncliffe, while armed with a dangerous weapon, being a shortened 12-gauge self-loading shotgun (the Parkside robbery). There were at least three co-offenders. One offender threatened staff with a shotgun. The applicant was holding a handgun and also made threats to the staff (although the pistol was later found not to be in working order). The offenders left with two stolen cars, one of which was driven by the applicant
	
	
	Count 3 concerned a conspiracy with three identified persons between 10 and 13 April 2005 to commit a further robbery on the Qantas Staff Credit Union at Hurstville while armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a shortened 12-gauge self-loading shotgun (the conspiracy).
	
	
	Tupman DCJ found that each of the offences in their own way was very serious. Her Honour considered the offences well above the circumstances referred to in the guideline case of R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 (Henry). Her Honour found special circumstances on the basis that a longer period was required for integration into the community and partial accumulation.
	
	
	On 30 August 2007 Tupman DCJ sentenced the applicant as follows:
	


Count 1 (the Hurstville robbery): Imprisonment for a term of 6 years 6 months commencing on 12 April 2006 and expiring on 11 October 2012 with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months commencing on 12 April 2006 and expiring on 11 October 2010.

Count 2 (the Parkside robbery): Imprisonment for a term of 6 years 6 months commencing on 12 April 2010 and concluding on 11 October 2016 with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months commencing on 12 April 2010 and expiring on 11 October 2013.

Count 3 (the conspiracy): Imprisonment for a term of 5 years 6 months commencing on 12 April 2008 and concluding on 11 October 2013 with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months commencing on 12 April 2008 and expiring on 11 October 2011.


	
	As a result of partial accumulation and concurrence the total effective sentence imposed by Tupman DCJ was 10 years 6 months commencing on 12 April 2006 and expiring on 11 October 2016 with an effective non-parole period of 7 years 6 months commencing on 12 April 2006 and expiring on 11 October 2013. The sentence was reduced by 20% for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. The sentence was also partially accumulated on sentences imposed in 1999 in respect of similar armed robbery offences (the 1999 offences). The commencement date of the sentence on count 1 of the 2005 offences was 12 months after the applicant’s arrest, that is from 12 April 2006.
	
	
	An appeal to this Court against the severity of the sentence imposed by Tupman DCJ on grounds which included an asserted failure to have proper regard to the principle of totality was unsuccessful: Baleiovalau v R [2009] NSWCCA 153.
	


The applicant’s subjective case


	
	The applicant was born in Fiji on 13 February 1980. He was 24 years old at the time of the 2004 offence and 34 years old on sentence. The applicant was the eldest of three sons who came to Australia with his mother when he was about 11 or 13 years of age. The judge said (ROS 16):
	


He has had a patchy educational experience. He has had a history of drug abuse since his late teens. He had his primary education in Fiji, secondary education at Punchbowl Boys High School where he left due to problems without completing Year 10. He has never worked outside of prison. He has found it difficult after the times he spent in custody to adjust after being released from prison.


	
	A report dated 6 August 2014 from a clinical psychologist, Mr Peter Champion, expressed the view that the applicant became peer dependent in adolescence and associated with peers who were involved in serious crimes, such associations being likely to add to a distortion of his attitudes and values.
	
	
	The applicant has a criminal history for similar robbery offences in 1997 dealt with in the Children’s Court, and in 1999 dealt with in the District Court. For the 1999 offences, he was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 6 October 1999.
	
	
	The psychologist recorded that the applicant had been ambivalent about his release on parole in October 2004, because he was concerned about his ability to cope in the community.
	
	
	The psychologist expressed the view that the applicant may have become institutionalised, noting that in the last 15 years the applicant had been in custody for almost all but 6 months.
	
	
	The psychologist could only rate the applicant’s prognosis as guarded, and poor in the event of a relapse into drug use or social dislocation, including loss of accommodation and/or family support networks.
	


The sentencing judgment


	
	The judge noted that the offending was aggravated as the applicant had been on conditional liberty for similar offences at the time of the 2004 offence (ROS 6). He accepted that the 2004 offence was “essentially the same period of criminality, going over about four months” as the 2005 offences (ROS 9-10). He observed in relation to the 2005 offences (ROS 9-10):
	


Those robberies I note included the use of disguises, scarfs, clubs, a sledge hammer and a sawn-off 22 riffle [sic]. Her Honour judged the offences in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. In relation to one of the offences the robbery of a motor vehicle her Honour found the specific purpose was to use the vehicle in a further armed robbery of which the offenders stood charged. In that sense there is that connection between the two offences which I have dealt.

In the course of the robbery Mr Baleiovalau, the offender, held a gun pointed at the victims of that robbery and phones were ripped from the walls. As I say in this regard there is resonance in the facts which I found in the present two cases.

….

I have been furnished with the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment as to those matters and I note as to those matters as the Crown asked because the observation is correct, that at paras 10 through to 13 the similarity of the facts which I will broadly summarise, are self-evident.


	
	The judge found that the applicant was not a young offender without criminal history; a working firearm was presented; the firearm was discharged and a person was injured. Accordingly the judge considered the Henry guideline should be put aside (ROS 20).
	
	
	The judge found that there was significant planning in relation to the offending. He accepted that there was only limited violence in the sense that minor injuries were occasioned to a bystander. Nonetheless his Honour found that the possession and discharge of a pistol in a public place would cause significant fear and trauma to the person actually injured and those who witnessed it. He found that the victims, particularly the bank tellers, were in a vulnerable position and so were the customers of the bank (ROS 20-21).
	
	
	The judge noted that a number of aggravating factors referred to in the Henry guideline were engaged to “some extent”, including the presence of a loaded pistol, significant planning, the use of force - both the discharge of the pistol and the use of the sledgehammer - and that the applicant was in company, there being three co-offenders involved (ROS 21).
	
	
	While the judge accepted that the applicant was unarmed, he found beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was aware of the presence of a dangerous weapon, that it was loaded and knew of a possibility that it might be discharged (ROS 25-26).
	
	
	The judge referred to the evidence of the psychologist which has been already mentioned (ROS 16-17). He was unable to make any finding about the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation (ROS 19).
	
	
	The judge referred to R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517; Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59; and Wu v R [2011] NSWCCA 102; 211 A Crim R 88. He found that there were delays in the investigation and prosecution of the 2004 offence and the effects of the delay were “not insignificant” (ROS 21-22). He did not accept that the applicant was in a state of uncertain suspense, in the absence of evidence from the applicant on the sentencing hearing (ROS 24). He found that the applicant had not taken any active steps prior to May 2013 to undertake the Violent Offenders Program (ROS 27).
	
	
	The judge accepted the evidence of the psychologist that the applicant had become institutionalised, having spent almost 15 years in custody (ROS 27).
	
	
	The judge made a finding of special circumstances to deal with any remnants of the applicant’s drug abuse and imposed the sentence already indicated (ROS 29). He added:
	


… of course there is in a sense a notional of [sic] accumulation of sentences given the fact that I have taken into account issues of totality (ROS 29).

Ground 1: Objective seriousness of the offending


	
	Ground 1 asserts that his Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	The applicant points to the passage in his Honour’s remarks on sentence (set out at [29] above), where he referred to Tupman DCJ having assessed the 2005 offences in the middle of the range of objective seriousness and observed that there was a resonance in the facts of the present cases involving the applicant and Mr Taotala.
	
	
	The applicant accepts that the connection found by the judge between the 2005 offences and the 2004 offence was justified. The complaint which is made is that the judge lost sight of the significant differences between the offences and as a result erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the 2004 offence as being the same as the 2005 offences.
	
	
	The applicant points to the following differences: his more active role in the Parkside robbery; the fact that the firearm was not pointed at the victims during the Regents Park robbery; and that the Regents Park robbery appears “more spontaneous”, due to it being first in time and the offender not covering his face or carrying a weapon.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge did not merely adopt Tupman DCJ’s finding in relation to the objective seriousness of the 2005 offences. While the judge accepted that the applicant was unarmed, the Crown emphasised the judge’s finding that the applicant knew that there was a dangerous weapon present, that it was loaded and knew of the possibility that it might be discharged.
	


Decision


	
	It bears repeating that the characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is a matter for the sentencing judge as Spigelman CJ explained in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37]:
	


This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion.

Simpson J expressed similar observations at [46].


	
	Here the judge correctly identified and took into account the factors referred to the Henry guideline relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. I accept the Crown’s submission that the features of the Parkside robbery were not of such a difference to distinguish the 2005 offences from the 2004 offence.
	
	
	The Regents Park robbery was a serious example of an offence of that kind. It involved the applicant attempting to rob a bank with two other masked men. Significant planning was involved and force was used in an attempt to gain entry to the teller area. The firearm was discharged and a customer was injured; fortunately, only a minor injury. Undoubtedly, the bank staff and other customers were traumatised and placed in real danger. Although the applicant himself was unarmed, the applicant knew, as his Honour found, that there was a dangerous weapon present, that it was loaded and of the possibility that it might be discharged.
	
	
	The finding that the 2004 offence was in the middle of the range of objective seriousness was open to the judge.
	
	
	Ground 1 is not made out.
	


Ground 2: Principle of totality


	
	Ground 2 asserts that the judge did not give any meaningful effect to the principle of totality.
	
	
	The applicant accepts that the judge correctly identified the applicable principles with respect to the issue of totality and expressly stated that he had taken into account issues of totality.
	
	
	The complaint made is that his Honour failed to apply those principles, because the effect of the sentence imposed on the applicant for the 2004 offence was to increase both the overall term by 18 months and the effective non-parole period by 2 years 6 months.
	
	
	Further, although the sentence on the 2004 offence carries a non-parole period of 60% of the total term, for the aggregate sentence on the 2004 and 2005 offences the proportion is approximately 83%.
	
	
	It was submitted that a significant degree of concurrency with the sentence imposed for the 2005 offences was appropriate to reflect the overall criminality of the offending given: the time span within which the four offences were committed between December 2004 and April 2005; the degree of similarity in the modus operandi employed by the applicant and his co-offenders; and the absence of any stolen items in the 2004 offence and the conspiracy charge dealt with by Tupman DCJ. In oral argument, counsel for the applicant also relied on the significant delay in the prosecution of the 2004 offence.
	
	
	The Crown emphasised that the judge’s decision whether to accumulate in respect of multiple offences is fundamentally an exercise within the discretion of the sentencing judge: LG v R [2012] NSWCCA 249 at [24]; R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66 at [7] (Simpson J). Reference was also made to the well-known observations of Howie J (Adams and Price JJ agreeing ) in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27].
	


Decision


	
	When sentencing the applicant for the 2004 offence it was necessary for the judge to ensure that the aggregation of all of the sentences is a “just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved”: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 307-308 (McHugh J).
	
	
	As Howie J explained in Cahyadi v R at [27]:
	


… there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.


	
	The issue in the present case is whether the accumulation is too great. This has two aspects: both the effective non-parole period and the overall term. The totality principle is not limited to the fixing of a non-parole period: Mill v The Queen at 66.
	
	
	It may be seen from the concluding remarks of Lakatos SC DCJ (set out at [37] above) that his Honour intended “a notional accumulation of sentences”. This would have been consistent with his Honour’s findings that the period of criminality involving the 2004 and 2005 offences was essentially the same and that the applicant was not responsible for the significant delay in the prosecution of the 2004 offence.
	
	
	However, as the applicant correctly pointed out, there was nothing “notional” in the accumulation of the sentence for the 2004 offence on the earlier sentence on the 2005 offences. The effect of the accumulation by extending the overall term by 18 months and the non-parole period by 2 years 6 months was inconsistent with his Honour’s stated intention. In particular, his Honour seems to have overlooked that the accumulation of the sentence on the 2005 offences meant that for the overall term of the sentence (12 years), the proportion of the non-parole period (10 years) was in the order of 83%. That outcome was unexplained by his Honour. It seems that his Honour may have overlooked it. The outcome was excessive and unwarranted.
	
	
	Ground 2 is made out.
	


Ground 3: Comparison of related offenders


	
	Ground 3 as amended asserts that the judge erred by comparing the applicant and Mr Taotala when determining the sentence to be imposed upon the applicant. This ground accepts that the applicant and Mr Taotala were not co-offenders, having regard to the not guilty verdict for Mr Taotala on the charge for the Regents Park robbery. The applicant’s complaint is directed to the various observations by the judge in the remarks on sentence comparing the individual circumstances of the applicant and Mr Taotala.
	
	
	The Crown submits that in the context of parallel criminal proceedings for related offences, it was inevitable that the sentencing judge would make some mention of the similarities and points of distinction between the two offenders.
	


Decision


	
	In my view there is no foundation to this complaint. The judge expressly acknowledged that he was sentencing the applicant and Mr Taotala for separate offences (ROS 18) in relation to which different penalties operated (ROS 29). He identified the facts relating to the individual offences and referred to the different applicable maximum penalties.
	
	
	Insofar as the judge mentioned similarities and differences between the circumstances of the applicant and Mr Taotala, his Honour was not undertaking a comparison of the applicant’s offending or subjective circumstances with those of Mr Taotala. On a fair reading of the remarks on sentence, his Honour was merely outlining the relevant circumstances and nature of the offending of each of the applicant and Mr Taotala, and the nature of their respective subjective case. Where there were differences in their individual circumstances it was inevitable that the judge would describe them as such.
	
	
	Ground 3 has not been made out.
	


Ground 4: The sentence was manifestly excessive


	
	Ground 4 asserts that the sentence which was imposed was manifestly excessive. Counsel for the applicant accepted that it was unnecessary to deal with this complaint if error is otherwise established under any of the other grounds of appeal. That may be accepted.
	
	
	Error having been found in respect of ground 2, the terms of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) apply. Accordingly, it is the duty of this court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh: Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 201 at [42]-[43] (French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ). It is not incumbent on the applicant to demonstrate that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	


Is some other sentence warranted in law?


	
	In exercising the sentencing discretion afresh, the proper approach in accordance with R v Todd and Mill v The Queen is to assess what would have been the likely sentence imposed if the applicant had been dealt with for all offences at the same time.
	
	
	The objective features of the applicant’s offending and the evidence of the applicant’s subjective circumstances which was placed before Lakatos SC DCJ, has been summarised above. The applicant did not seek to place before this Court any evidence of his circumstances post sentence. While the attempted armed robbery did not succeed, the judge correctly found that it was a serious offence involving significant planning, the use of force and the discharge of a firearm by a co-offender.
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel referred to the statistics in the period January 2008 to December 2014, for attempted robbery offences, armed with a dangerous weapon. The most recent statistics for the period April 2008 to March 2015 show that, in superior courts, 8 out of 16 offenders (50%) had a term of imprisonment imposed upon them that was less than the 5 year total term imposed upon the applicant.
	
	
	However, the statistics upon which reliance was placed do not assist. As the Crown correctly pointed out, the statistics are of particularly limited use in the present case given the small number of offenders sentenced. The applicant was only one of two offenders to plead not guilty and a significant aggravating factor in the applicant’s case is that the offence was committed whilst he was on parole for similar offences.
	
	
	In the present case, it is necessary to consider the effect of partial accumulation of the sentence on the 2004 offence on the ratio between the overall non-parole period and the overall term of the sentence: Barrett v R [2011] NSWCCA 213 at [29] (Hidden J; Whealy JA and Johnson J agreeing).
	
	
	In my view, if the 2004 and 2005 offences had been dealt with at the same time, the likely overall term would have been about 11 years. An appropriate overall non-parole period would have been about 8 years.
	
	
	Although the term of 5 years imposed by Lakatos SC DCJ was otherwise appropriate, I am persuaded that a lesser sentence than that imposed by his Honour was warranted in law in terms of partial accumulation and concurrency on the 2005 offences.
	
	
	Having regard to the partial accumulation of the sentence on the 2005 offences that I would propose in the following paragraph, I would also make a finding of special circumstances to ensure an appropriate overall non-parole period for the 2004 and 2005 offences.
	
	
	Accordingly, I would propose a non-parole period of 2 years commencing from 11 April 2012 and ending on 10 April 2014 with a balance of term of 3 years commencing on 11 April 2014 and expiring on 10 April 2017. It follows that the applicant would be now eligible for release on parole.
	
	
	I acknowledge that the orders I propose will result in the total non-parole period being about 73% of the total sentence rather than the 71% resulting from the orders of Tupman DCJ and that this result gives little effect to the finding of special circumstances made by her Honour. A lesser percentage could be arrived at by delaying the start of the sentence imposed by Lakatos SC DCJ and providing for a longer balance of term than I propose. However, given the length of the effective non-parole period and total sentence consequent on what I have proposed, I am not persuaded that such a change is required or would be of benefit to the applicant. Undoubtedly the matter is complicated by the sentence which Tupman DCJ originally imposed.
	


Conclusion


	
	There should be a grant of leave to appeal as an error in the sentencing process has been made out on ground 2. I am persuaded that a lesser sentence is warranted in law. The orders that I propose are as follows:
	


1   Grant leave to appeal.

2   Appeal allowed.

3   The sentence imposed in the District Court on 21 August 2014 is quashed.

4   The applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 11 April 2012 and expiring on 10 April 2014, with a balance of term of 3 years commencing on 11 April 2014 and expiring on 10 April 2017. The Court notes that the applicant is now eligible for release on parole.


	
	BELLEW J: I agree with Gleeson JA.
	
	
	R S HULME AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Gleeson JA and with his Honour’s reasons.

2768352,El-Ali v R [2015] NSWCCA 300,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: I have had the opportunity of agreeing with R A Hulme J's comprehensive reasons, with which I agree. I also agree with the orders his Honour has proposed.
	
	
	ADAMS J: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Houssam Khaled El-Ali (""the applicant"") was found guilty by a jury in a trial before her Honour Judge Sweeney on 31 May 2012 of an offence of having sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation (the victim was under the age of 16, namely 13).
	
	
	The offence is contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). There is a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and there is also a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years dating from 31 May 2012. The non-parole period expires on 30 May 2018 and the total term expires on 30 May 2021.
	
	
	The applicant seeks to appeal against conviction on the following grounds (grounds 2 and 4 were abandoned at the hearing):
	


1.   The verdict was unreasonable within the meaning of s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

3.   In determining that the probative value of the tendency evidence substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect, as required by s 101 Evidence Act 1995, her Honour erred in concluding, without further analysis, that the risk of the jury using the evidence improperly or unfairly would be small, if the jury were to be given the “usual directions”.

5.   Her Honour erred in failing to provide reasons for refusing the application to discharge the jury.


	
	He also seeks leave to appeal against sentence and this will be addressed later.
	


Overview of the competing cases


	
	The Crown case was that on a day between 1 January and 30 May 2005 the applicant, a man then aged 34, took the complainant, a school student aged 13, to a motel room and provided her with alcohol. He then had anal intercourse with her without her consent.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon evidence given by a number of other women, who had been teenagers at the time, who had been “groomed” and/or sexually assaulted by the applicant. This was said to establish that he had a tendency ""to have a sexual interest in young girls aged about 12 to 15 years old; to ingratiate himself with such young girls by giving them compliments, cigarettes, alcohol or gifts as part of a process of grooming them for his attentions; and then, with each young girl, to test how she reacted to his comments, conversations or acts to see if he could pursue taking advantage of them"" (SU 18).
	
	
	The applicant's case was that he knew the complainant and her group of friends but not well. He did not take her to a motel and he did not give her alcohol. He did not have sexual intercourse with her and had never had sexual intercourse with an underage girl. He denied being sexually interested in young girls and disputed all of the tendency evidence.
	


Procedural history


	
	On 1 May 2012 the Crown presented an indictment against the applicant containing nine counts relating to five complainants. The applicant sought separate trials, arguing that the evidence of the complainants, and the evidence of other witnesses, was not admissible as tendency evidence. The trial judge refused the application.
	
	
	The applicant filed an application for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The application was later withdrawn but in the meantime the Crown determined to proceed with the trial with just one complainant, GM. That trial commenced on 14 May 2012 but the jury was discharged without verdict on 21 May 2012 for reasons which are of no present relevance (“the first trial”).
	
	
	A second trial commenced before her Honour and a new jury on 22 May 2012. The recorded evidence of the complainant from the first trial was played before the jury (Ch 6 Pt 5 Div 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW)). As indicated earlier, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty on 31 May 2012.
	


The evidence in detail

The complainant, GM


	
	The complainant, GM, said that she met the applicant through a friend when she was aged 13 and in Year 8 at school. She was introduced to him by a 13 year old female friend, KN, at a tobacconist shop in Katoomba. GM had attended the store for the purpose of purchasing cigarettes. The applicant gave her a packet without her having to pay.
	
	
	GM met the applicant again about a week later in the late afternoon of a school day. The meeting was arranged by KN. GM and her sister, KM (a year older than GM), went to the vicinity of the car park of a supermarket and waited for the applicant. GM said that they met with the applicant and he drove to a motel in Blackheath. The applicant was accompanied by a friend, Dean Boyd, who the complainant guessed was in his twenties. She said that KM knew Mr Boyd but she had not met him before herself. GM said that her friend, KN, was supposed to be coming to the motel, but did not.
	
	
	When they arrived at the motel, the applicant went into the office and booked a room whilst the complainant and KM waited in the car. When he returned they all went to the room. GM described the motel room as being “small”. On the way to the room the applicant said that they should go “quietly and quickly” so that they were not seen. Once in the room they sat around and started to drink alcohol. GM thought the alcohol was bourbon and said it was mixed with coca cola. The applicant was drinking the soft drink, not the alcohol. GM said KM was drinking alcohol and she could not remember whether Dean Boyd was.
	
	
	After being in the room for some time the four left and the applicant drove them to Mr Boyd’s father’s house. By this stage GM said she had had about two drinks and felt “a little tipsy”. Mr Boyd left the car when they arrived at his father’s house and was absent for a short time. They all eventually returned to the motel.
	
	
	GM said that in the course of the night she had four or five drinks altogether. They were just “drinking, talking, and smoking cigarettes”. GM said she felt tipsy, sick and very hot. She went to use the bathroom but the applicant came in so she returned to the room and lay on the bed because she wasn’t feeling well. She was under the covers but still dressed. The applicant got under the covers with her and was trying to undress her but she kept moving away. At this point she could not remember where her sister and Mr Boyd were. She could not recall whether the lights were on or off but she remembered that the television was on.
	
	
	GM was asked to clarify what she meant by the applicant trying to undress her and she said that he was trying to pull her pants down. She was trying to push him away but he ended up getting her pants off. She said that she could not remember all of the details but that she ended up on her back and he was entering her from behind. When asked to clarify she said “his penis” entered “my bum” and that it hurt. She said it probably felt like it lasted five or ten minutes. She was telling him not to do it; she did not want him to; and she kept trying to push him away but could not. (In cross-examination she said that at the time he entered her she was on her stomach and he was behind her (see below at [37]).)
	
	
	At some stage the applicant stopped and GM grabbed her clothes and went into the bathroom. She went to the toilet and got changed before returning to the room. The applicant said to her, “you’re lucky I let you keep your virginity”. Mr Boyd and KM were “just sitting around”. The applicant gave GM money for herself and KM to get a train home. He told them to stay the night at the motel and leave in the morning without being seen.
	
	
	The next morning GM and KM went to the train station and went home. GM did not talk about what had happened. She was asked whether the next day was a school day and she said it was. She did not go to school because she felt sick.
	
	
	GM was asked about another occasion on which she had been at a motel with the applicant. She could not recall when it was in relation to the incident she had just described. She said it “could have been up to a year” (presumably later). She said there were “a few of us there and we were all going there to drink”. The others comprised KM, KN, EH and a male friend known by the nickname “Shorty”. This was at a motel on the highway at Katoomba across from the hospital. (The evidence of other witnesses indicates that this was the G’Day Motel.) GM understood that KN had organised this with the applicant. GM had walked to the motel with her sister (KM) and friends. It was late in the afternoon although she could not recall whether it was a school day. There was alcohol in the room but no food. She said that the applicant and KN were outside talking in his car whilst the rest were in the room drinking. She said EH was drunk. EH became very upset; she ran off and said she was going to kill herself. GM said that she was drunk as well. There was quite a deal of noise and the applicant said that it was getting too loud and they would have to keep it down or they would have to leave.
	
	
	GM was asked about speaking to the police some time in December 2006. She said she could not recall when it was but she spoke to a female police officer (Constable Moir) at Katoomba Police Station who was writing notes or making a statement. She did not remember reading what the officer had recorded.
	
	
	GM agreed that she made a statement to police on 8 January 2009. A detective from Springwood had telephoned and asked her to do so.
	
	
	The complainant said that a short time after she had first been to the police she saw the applicant in a shopping centre car park at Katoomba. He called her over and he asked if she had told anyone what had happened. She said she lied and told him that she had not told anyone. He replied that it had all been “a bit of fun”.
	
	
	In cross-examination, GM agreed that in a statement she had made in November 2011 she had said in relation to the second occasion of being at a motel with the applicant that she could not recall how it was organised and how everyone got there. She agreed that this was different to what she had said earlier in her evidence. She denied that it was because she had spoken with KM about how they got to the second motel.
	
	
	GM also accepted that in her statement made in January 2009 she had not mentioned going to another motel.
	
	
	She said that when she first met the applicant she was at the tobacconist’s shop for between 10 and 20 minutes. She repeated that KN was present. She said that they went “into the back bit”. She could not recall the conversation that took place, explaining that “this was years ago”. She disagreed with a proposition that the applicant had never provided her with cigarettes.
	
	
	GM agreed that the first time she had told anyone in authority about what the applicant had done was when she spoke to the police officer in December 2006. She could not remember the name of the officer but agreed that the events in question would likely have been much fresher in her mind at that time.
	
	
	GM was cross-examined about what she told Constable Moir on that occasion. She said that she could not recall saying that KN had been in the motel on the night in question. She suggested that the officer could have got it wrong and that she could not remember reading over what the officer had written. She agreed that KN was a friend who lived above a music shop on Katoomba Street. She said that she could not recall saying to the officer that when they returned to the motel after going for a drive that KN fell asleep. She suggested “the police officer could have got [KN] and [KM]” mixed up.
	
	
	GM was asked whether she had said in 2006 that the assault occurred at the High Mountain Motor Lodge. (The cross-examiner was wrong to suggest this – she had only described the location and Constable Moir had worked out and written down that it was this particular motel.) She explained: “I know I got it wrong, but I can’t exactly remember the name that I had told them”. She was reminded that in her 2009 statement she had referred to the Bells Motel. She explained that there were a few motels along the highway so she must have got them mixed up or been confused. She agreed that when she made her statement in November 2011 she said that it happened at the High Mountain Motor Inn and that she had taken a detective there and pointed it out.
	
	
	GM said that she had consumed about two cans containing alcohol by the time they had left the motel for a drive. She repeated that it made her feel tipsy and very hot. She had four to five drinks from the time she first arrived at the motel to the time that the applicant got in bed with her. She was intoxicated but she did not know how drunk she was.
	
	
	GM recalled that it was mentioned that Mr Boyd was getting cannabis when they went to his father’s house. However, she did not see anyone smoking cannabis in the motel room.
	
	
	After GM had been cross-examined for some time it appeared that she became frustrated as is indicated by the following passage:
	


“Q. Ma'am, do you accept that when you spoke to the police in 2006, you made no mention at all of Dean Boyd, firstly, being in that motel room that night. Do you accept that?

A. I'll accept anything, I really don't care.

Q. Do you accept that you made no mention of Dean Boyd being in the car when you went for the drive?

A. Yes, whatever.

Q. Do you remember saying to the police in 2006 that you don't remember anyone getting out of the car during that drive?

A. I don't remember.

Q. You didn't tell them in 2006 that Dean Boyd went to his father's house and got cannabis?

A. I don't know.

BREEZE: Does your Honour want me to press on?

HER HONOUR: It's quarter past 11. Yes, why not?

BREEZE

Q. Do you know why you didn't tell the police in 2006 that Dean Boyd was there?

A. No, I don't know why.

Q. Do you know why you didn't tell the police in 2006 that your sister was there?

A. I don't know why.

Q. Was [KN] ever asleep on the floor in the motel room?

A. The first time, are you talking?

Q. At all yes, the first motel room?

A. Beg your pardon?

Q. The first time?

A. Yeah, she wasn't asleep anywhere.

Q. Do you remember telling the police in 2006 that Sam El-Ali lied on top of you and pulled your pants down, and you said no?

A. I don't remember.

Q. Is that how it happened?

A. I don't remember.”


	
	The trial judge then called for a break and in the absence of the jury there was the following exchange:
	


“CROWN PROSECUTOR: I'm sorry, your Honour. Just in relation to the last answer, it was put to her about the assault and she says, ""I don't remember."" Now, in my view she was sort of shutting down and I thought it may be appropriate for a break, your Honour.

HER HONOUR: It did appear that way, that she was perhaps getting - well, yes. Well, how do we communicate to her - if we take the break now, …”


	
	GM’s evidence thereafter in response to the cross-examination included a significant number of answers comprising, “I don’t remember” or similar.
	
	
	She agreed that in her 2009 statement she said, “He rolled me over onto my tummy”. Initially, she could not recall whether that was different to what she had said in her evidence in chief. She then agreed that she had said earlier that she ended up on her back and the applicant was entering her. When asked whether that was different to what she had said to the police in 2009 she replied:
	


“A. At some point, I would have been on my back. I would have, you know, been in all different positions. I don't remember how every little thing led to it. That's what I'm trying to say. I could have been in any position but I can't remember exactly, you know, what position I was in when. So --

Q. So do you tell us that at the moment that you say Sam El-Ali entered you, you don't know whether you were on your tummy or your back?

A. I was on my stomach. He was behind me.”


	
	She was further pressed about this:
	


“Q. You were mistaken yesterday about saying you were on your back when he entered you?

A. I - I think I've gotten confused, cause I know that I was on my stomach and he was behind me on the bed. So obviously I've gotten confused and that's all I can say.”


	
	She said she was crying, softly, when this was occurring.
	
	
	As to the presence of Mr Boyd and KM in the room at the time of these events she gave the following evidence:
	


“Q. Do you say that Dean Boyd and your sister were in the room at the same time that he was trying to undress you and you were trying to push him away and move away from him?

A. Yes.

Q. You were crying?

A. Yes.

Q. Did Dean Boyd do anything to stop what was happening?

A. No. He was too busy trying to fuck my sister.

Q. How do you know that?

A. Good guess.

Q. Did your sister try to stop Sam El-Ali from trying to take your clothes off?

A. No.

Q. But they were both right in a room a couple of metres away from you, weren't they?

A. Yeah.

Q. Did they say anything? Did they say, leave her alone, stop?

A. No.

Q. After it happened did you go into the bathroom?

A. Yes.

Q. When you came out was everyone sitting around talking as if nothing had happened?

A. Yes.

Q. You say that Sam El-Ali sexually assaulted you and you went into the bathroom and you came out and neither your sister or Dean said anything. Is that right?

A. That's right.”


	
	She agreed that when she came out of the bathroom after the incident she did not say anything to Mr Boyd or her sister about the applicant having just raped her. She said that the applicant and Mr Boyd left, “not very long after”. She did not complain to her sister after they left the motel about having been assaulted by the applicant.
	
	
	GM said that she next saw her mother the following afternoon after school had finished. She did not tell her mother about what had occurred, “because I wasn’t supposed to be where I was”.
	
	
	GM was then asked how long after the assault occurred that she told anyone. The complainant said she could not recall even whether it was days, weeks or months later.
	
	
	The complainant’s frustration with the cross-examination appears to have continued. She was asked about something she had said in her 2009 statement about having not had anything further to do with the applicant or Mr Boyd after the incident. This was contrasted with her earlier evidence about the applicant having asked her on a subsequent occasion whether she had told anyone. GM’s answer to that question and the balance of the cross-examination was follows:
	


“A. Well, I don't care, whatever. I don't care if you believe me. I just want you to finish your questions so I can go home. Don't find him guilty. I honestly don't care. I just want to go home. I haven't had a shower in four days. I have no hot water. I want to go home. I don't care if you don't believe me. I am done.

Q. Why did you say to the police I've had nothing further to do with either Dean Boyd or Sam El-Ali when it wasn't true?

A. Because I wanted to get out of the police station. I had had enough of sitting there. I wanted to go home like now. I will say anything to go home.

Q. Sam El-Ali didn't assault you that night at the motel did he?

A. If that's what you're saying, whatever.

Q. Do you agree?

A. No, I do not agree with that.

Q. Sam El-Ali wasn't at the motel that night with you was he?

A. Whatever.

Q. Sam El-Ali didn't pick you up in a car earlier that afternoon did he?

A. Whatever.

Q. He didn't drive with you or Dean Boyd or [KM] or anyone else after you had got to the motel?

A. All I have to say is Sam, be a man, tell the truth. Stop putting everyone through this. You know what you did, just admit it. Grow some balls.

Q. Sam El-Ali was never at a motel on a second occasion was he?

A. Yes, he was.”


	
	In re-examination the complainant agreed that she had spoken with a friend, SF. She could not recall when it was but she had told him what had happened.
	


Constable Janice Moir


	
	Constable Moir (as she then was) was called upon to speak to GM on 28 December 2006 when GM attended the Katoomba Police Station at 9pm. Constable Moir was a general duties officer and explained her role as taking a basic report, enough to establish what needed to be done next, and not to probe the victim. At that time of night there were no detectives available and she was obtaining a general report that would be handed to detectives the following day.
	
	
	Constable Moir said she had not seen GM again after that evening until just prior to the trial. She wrote notes during the course of the conversation on a scrap piece of paper and she later transferred the information to her notebook. She did not read back to GM her notes or offer her the opportunity to read them.
	
	
	There was mention of going for a drive to Katoomba after having arrived at the motel at Blackheath. There was no mention of Mr Boyd. GM told Constable Moir that she did not report the matter to police at the time because she was afraid she would get into trouble for drinking. She said that she had since told a friend who had told another friend and through this process she had been encouraged to notify the police. She had not told her parents about the incident and did not want them to know.
	
	
	The overall tenor of the notes was that it was KN rather than KM who was present with the complainant in the motel room with the applicant, and no other person.
	


Complaint witness - SF


	
	SF said that his mother was in a relationship with the applicant’s brother, Michael. He knew GM and had met her, he thought, in Year 5 in 2005. The complainant had told him that she and her sister used to get cigarettes from the applicant who SF knew to own a tobacconist shop.
	
	
	At some time, which the Crown Prosecutor put to him was between 2005 and 2007, SF had a conversation with GM at school. She said that over the weekend that had just passed she had been sexually assaulted by the applicant. She said they had been smoking and drinking in a hotel room when it occurred. He described her demeanour as very emotional at the time she told him this. He told her to report it to police. He said he was not sure whether she did so; “she seemed a little bit scared”.
	
	
	In cross-examination, SF confirmed that the conversation occurred on a Monday and concerned events of the weekend just passed. He was pressed as to when this was and he was unsure. By a process of elimination, based upon what year of high school he was in, he narrowed it down to 2005 and 2006.
	
	
	SF said that he was first asked to make a statement recalling these matters a month before he gave evidence in the trial.
	


KM


	
	KM was the complainant’s older sister. She met the applicant sometime in the middle of about 2004 when she was in Year 9. She met him through a friend, KN, at a tobacconist store. They went there to get cigarettes. They did not have to pay. She said she went there once or twice a week for that purpose. She would go with her friend KN, or with her sister or with other friends. She said the applicant initially acted friendly towards her but then, “he got more sleazy”. On one occasion, “he asked me to give him a hand job”. She did not do that and did not think he was really serious.
	
	
	There was an occasion when she said the applicant invited her and her sister and other friends to the G’Day Motel in Katoomba. She said that she assumed that they would have walked there because it was not very far from where she was living. She said the applicant was present as well as another man. There was no food but there was alcohol. She had one or two drinks herself. She was not very drunk. She was 14 or 15 years old at the time. She recalled a friend, EH being upset and intoxicated. She recalled other details that coincided with the evidence of the complainant.
	
	
	KM gave evidence about another occasion when she was at the tobacconist shop. There was another man there and her friend KN was there as well. The other man gave KN a shoulder massage while the applicant took KM to a back room and pulled her onto his lap, unbuttoned her pants and put his finger into her vagina. She asked him to stop but when he did not she just got up.
	
	
	KM said she knew a man by the name of Dean Boyd who she had met through school. She recalled an occasion where she arranged to meet him at the Franklins car park in Katoomba with her sister and with KN, however KN did not show up. The applicant arrived in his car. Mr Boyd suggested they go for a drive. They first went to a park at Leura where they consumed some alcohol and then went to a motel on the highway at Blackheath. She said that she felt disoriented, weird and tired which she attributed to the alcohol. Mr Boyd was smoking cannabis from a bong. He offered KM some but she declined. At one point she recalled that her sister was laying on the bed and “I think I passed out on the floor”. At this time the applicant was either sitting on the bed or was near to it.
	
	
	KM said that she did not really know what happened during the course of the evening. When she woke up in the morning she was on the bed with her sister. She was asked whether she knew how she got to be on the bed and she said:
	


“I think I – I was woken up and they said that they were going and that we would be staying the night there, and I think I got – I think I put myself on the bed.”

She had no memory of what time it was. It was just herself and her sister on the bed and the applicant and Mr Boyd said that they were leaving.


	
	When they woke in the morning she and GM were concerned about having to get to school. They caught a train to Katoomba and went home and got dressed. Their mother was at work.
	
	
	KM said that GM did not say anything to her about what had happened.
	
	
	In cross-examination KM said that she did not discuss private things with her sister and they had only discussed their feelings and thoughts when their parents broke up.
	
	
	KM denied that after arriving at the motel there was an incident where the four had left to drive somewhere else before returning.
	
	
	She maintained that she had only had one drink before she fell asleep. She confirmed that she was not suggesting either of the men had put something in her drink. The last thing she remembered was being offered some marijuana when GM was laying on the bed and then she, KM, passed out on the floor.
	
	
	At no time did she hear GM say anything to the applicant like, “don’t” or “don’t do it” or similar. She confirmed, in effect, that the room was quite small. She did not see her sister moving her arms around or trying to push anyone away. At no point did she see her sister go into the bathroom. She did not hear the applicant say, “You are lucky I let you keep your virginity”. She did not hear her sister crying.
	


Tendency witness - KN


	
	KN said that she lived in Katoomba above a music store with her mother. She commenced going to the applicant’s tobacconist shop when she was 13 years old. She went with a friend, KM. On the first occasion the applicant asked for identification and when they were unable to produce any he declined to sell them cigarettes. However on subsequent occasions he did provide KN with cigarettes, only requiring her to pay on some occasions.
	
	
	KN said that conversations with the applicant were “pretty much sexual and alcohol wise”. She said he would ask her for sex and say that she looked pretty. He asked her if she had pretty friends that liked sex as well. She said that she did. He also asked her if she and her friends liked to drink and she said that they did.
	
	
	KN gave evidence of an occasion of going with KM to Lithgow McDonalds with the applicant. He was accompanied by his friend, Abdulla, who was sitting in the front of the car and KN and KM sat in the back of the car. They were provided with alcohol to drink on the journey. KN said that she became “quite drunk”. After consuming some food at Lithgow they returned to Katoomba. She was 13 years old at the time. On the way back to Katoomba the applicant said he and Abdulla would like to have sex with her and KM. They declined. She said that his behaviour changed; he took all the alcohol back and did not want to talk to her and KM anymore.
	
	
	KN said that she continued going to the applicant’s tobacco shop every day or second day. Sometimes she paid for cigarettes but not always. On occasions she would go into the back of the shop with the applicant and he would ask her to sit on his lap. This occurred, “nearly every time”. Other teenage girls would be present when this occurred. The applicant would rub his hands on her leg. She said that he would say that if the other girls saw him do it to her then they would let him do it to them.
	
	
	KN spoke about a party at the G’Day Motel at Katoomba on her 14th birthday. Those present included KM, GM and two other young girls as well as the applicant and Dean Boyd. All of the girls were aged 13 and 14. A lot of alcohol was consumed; it was provided by the applicant. The applicant paid for the accommodation. KN spent the night at the motel but when she woke in the morning the applicant was not there.
	
	
	There was another party a few weeks later at the G’Day Motel. Present were KM, GM, two more of their friends, a man known as “Shorty” as well as the applicant and Abdulla. Alcohol was consumed on the night, enough to make KN fall asleep intoxicated. She said that the applicant asked her for sex that night because he had supplied all the alcohol and cigarettes. She told him that she was too drunk. In cross-examination, KN agreed that at that party the applicant had said, “You’re my favourite” and “you’re the prettiest”.
	
	
	There was another occasion when an arrangement was made to go to a motel in Blackheath but KN’s mother did not allow her to go out that night. KN had spoken with KM, GM and two other friends about it.
	


Tendency witness – AM


	
	AM was in Year 7 and was 12 years of age in 2005. Her brother worked for the applicant in his trolley business. Her brother had a partner at the time who worked for the applicant in his tobacconist shop. AM first met the applicant near a supermarket when he was working in his trolley business.
	
	
	AM recalled an occasion in 2005 when the applicant offered a lift to her and her brother’s partner, Tara. AM and Tara had been walking to the home of a friend, LN. The applicant drove them to LN’s house and picked her up. He drove them to his shop. While they were in his car she recalled the applicant asking if age mattered when you like somebody. He then told AM that he was 20 years of age.
	
	
	When they were at his shop, AM was asked by Tara to meet the applicant out the back of the shop. AM went out to the back where she had a conversation with the applicant. He told her that he would “buy me stuff and I could have my freedom and things like that”. She also said that the applicant wanted to have children with her one day. She did not think that she responded. She said the applicant tried to kiss her and did give her a peck on the neck. He then asked her to go back inside and get his cigarettes and lighter from Tara. When she got up to do so “he touched me on the bum”. She said that the applicant also gave her $20 to catch a taxi to his house the next day because he wanted her to go and have coffee with him.
	
	
	AM said that she was upset about what had occurred. She told Tara about the applicant’s request for her to go and have coffee the next day and that she did not want to go. She gave the money to Tara to give back to the applicant. On a subsequent occasion she answered a telephone call at home which she said was from the applicant who was asking for her brother. During the course of the conversation the applicant referred to his girlfriend and was complaining about some aspect of their relationship. He also asked AM if he could ask her a personal question and when she agreed, he asked her if she was still a virgin. She responded in the affirmative and he replied, “That’s good because not many girls my age were”.
	


Tendency witness - LN


	
	LN said that when she was 13 or 14 she met the applicant when she was in the company of a friend in the car park of a supermarket where he was doing trolley collection work. She recalled that a woman walked past and glared in their direction. The woman was identified to LN as being the applicant’s partner, Felicia. She said the applicant waved it off and said, “don’t worry about her, she’s being a bitch” or similar.
	
	
	LN also spoke about an occasion when she was alone with the applicant at his home unit. She described him as continually moving closer to her prompting her to move away. He continued trying to get close to her, but nothing happened. The applicant told her that he was aged 21. She doubted that but had no reason not to trust what he said. The applicant said that he wanted to be with her and wanted to spend time with her.
	
	
	LN also spoke about an occasion at the applicant’s tobacco shop where a friend of hers, AM, was asked by the applicant to speak with him out the back. LN stayed in another part of the store and sometime later AM returned and was in tears. She left with AM who disclosed to her that the applicant had tried to kiss her. She said thereafter the two of them tried their best to avoid him.
	


Tendency witness - KW


	
	KW had known the applicant for some time. When she was aged 14 she frequently went to his tobacconist shop to buy cigarettes. He would also give them to her. She did this over a period of two years. She also gave evidence of the applicant taking her and friends for drives to places like Lithgow, Penrith or Springwood. On one occasion he provided alcohol for them to drink in the car. She was 15 years old at the time. On these occasions the applicant purchased clothes for her and her friends in the price range of $200 to $300.
	
	
	KW said that on one occasion he asked her to set up one of her friends for a date and he offered her $500 to do so. She declined. On another occasion he offered her $1000 to set up a date with another one of her friends. KW said that she was aware that the applicant had a partner at the time, Felicia Edgecombe.
	
	
	At some stage KW stopped seeing the applicant. She said it was, “because I just got sick of what he was trying to do to us”. KW was 16 years old at that time.
	


Isobel Gooby


	
	Ms Isobel Gooby worked at the G’Day Motel on the Great Western Highway at Katoomba. Her niece was at some stage in a relationship with the applicant’s brother. She knew the applicant and his brother had a trolley business in Katoomba. She also knew of a tobacco shop that they had.
	
	
	Ms Gooby recalled an occasion on 1 August 2003 when the applicant booked a room at the motel. She said he picked up the key and then got back into his car. The next morning when she cleaned the room it appeared not have been used. She saw a red cloth in the room with rose petals sprinkled on it. There were also bottles of vodka, orange juice, gin and tonic and other alcohol. There were also some plates of cheese and biscuits. From what she could see, none of the food and drink had been touched and the bed did not appear to have been used. She rang the applicant who told her that he thought he had the room for 24 hours. She told him that checkout time was 10am. He came to the hotel and collected the things he had left in the room and returned the key. (The Crown Prosecutor argued that this was another occasion of the applicant arranging a party at this motel which did not proceed for some reason.)
	
	
	Ms Gooby recalled another occasion about a month later when the applicant checked into a room at the motel and paid cash. She later noticed that there was a young girl in his car who only looked to be about 14 and who looked “very frightened”. Ms Gooby was concerned to the extent that she returned to the office and got the money that the applicant had tendered as payment and returned it to him. She asked how old the girl was and he replied, “none of your business”. In giving him the money back she told him to “piss off and don’t come back or else I’ll ring the police”. The applicant then left.
	
	
	In cross-examination it was put to Ms Gooby that she was mistaken about the applicant having been present on the second occasion. In the course of her evidence she spoke of various occasions upon which she had seen the applicant around the township of Katoomba. Although she had not had any interaction with him she had sufficient familiarity to recognise him. She insisted that she was not mistaken about him being at the motel on the second occasion.
	


Detective Senior Constable Dianne Erhardt


	
	Detective Erhardt was the officer-in-charge of the investigation. She said that the applicant was arrested on 9 July 2010. He told police that he knew AM and her brother. He did not know KM or EH. He was not sure if he knew GM.
	
	
	The applicant also told police that in 2010 his partner was Felicia Edgecombe and he had been to the G’Day Motel with her for her 18th birthday. She was born on 1 August 1986.
	
	
	The applicant denied that he had ever had sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16 and that he had ever inappropriately touched or kissed a girl. He had no prior criminal convictions.
	
	
	Detective Erhardt said that during the course of her investigation she tried to obtain statements from a number of potential witnesses including Dean Boyd but she was unable to.
	


The applicant


	
	The applicant gave evidence and was the only witness in the defence case. He was taken through the detail of all of the allegations by the complainant and all of the tendency witnesses. He denied being at motels with them and supplying them with alcohol and cigarettes. He denied any form of misconduct as they had alleged. The general effect of his evidence was that such acquaintance as he had with the complainant and the tendency witnesses was quite minimal, and certainly innocent. The applicant also disputed the evidence given by Ms Gooby as to the extent of alcohol that he had taken to the room at the G’Day Motel on the occasion of what he understood to be his girlfriend’s 18th birthday. He explained that he did not end up taking Ms Edgecombe to the room that night because he had found out earlier that she was in fact turning 17 and not 18 as he had been previously led to believe. He said they had a fight and so the evening’s events were cancelled.
	


Ground 1 – the verdict of guilty is unreasonable within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act


	
	The principles governing the determination of a ground such as this are not in dispute. It is convenient to refer to the succinct summary recently provided by Bathurst CJ in Agius v R [2015] NSWCCA 200:
	


""[1000] The principles governing the question of whether a verdict should be set aside as unreasonable are well established. In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11]-[14], the High Court stated that the approach to be adopted was that laid down by it in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 492-494. The Court is required to make its own independent assessment of the evidence. If, after taking into account the primary responsibility of the jury in determining the question of guilt or innocence and the benefit of the jury of having seen and heard the witness, the Court is left in doubt as to the reasonableness of the verdict, the doubt in most cases is a doubt that the jury should have experienced.

[1001] For a verdict to be unreasonable, it is not enough that a review of the evidence shows only that it was possible for the jury to have reached a different outcome. As was stated by Hayne J in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113], Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreeing, for the verdict to be set aside as unreasonable, the jury must have had, as distinct from might have had, a reasonable doubt.""


	
	Mr Lange, counsel for the applicant (who did not appear at the trial), emphasised that it was necessary for the jury to be satisfied of the essential aspects of the evidence of GM before a verdict of guilty could be returned. That may be readily accepted but it is important to bear in mind that her evidence did not fall for assessment entirely on its own. It was supported significantly by the evidence of KM when regard is had to the defence case that the applicant was never at a motel in Blackheath with GM.
	
	
	Moreover, the tendency evidence provided further support in that it showed that the applicant was a person who was sexually interested in girls of GM's age. It also showed that he gave vent to that inclination by ingratiating himself with such girls in various ways as part of a ""grooming"" process, including by the provision of cigarettes and alcohol. Mr Lange did not suggest that this evidence did not have significant probative value. On my own assessment it certainly did.
	
	
	I propose to deal in turn with each of the points raised in support of the ground.
	


Evidence of GM of being sexually assaulted not supported by either KM or Dean Boyd


	
	It was argued that the assault was said to have taken place in a relatively small motel room in the presence of the complainant's sister, KM, and Mr Dean Boyd, yet neither of those two observed anything let alone did something to assist GM.
	
	
	The point about Dean Boyd may be immediately rejected. He was the applicant's friend and it was said that he was consuming cannabis. It is unsurprising in these circumstances that he might not have intervened. In fact, it was GM's perception that Mr Boyd was ""too busy trying to fuck my sister"".
	
	
	The fact that Mr Boyd was said not to have observed the assault is speculative. Mr Boyd did not give evidence. Detective Erhardt said that she had tried to obtain a statement from him but had not been able to do so. Accordingly, it is unknown whether he saw anything or not.
	
	
	KM was overcome by intoxication and was either asleep or unconscious. This is capable of having been accepted by the jury as a rational explanation for her not seeing or hearing anything.
	
	
	The complainant's evidence is not rendered less credible for the absence of support from either KM or Dean Boyd. The result, however, is that her account of the sexual assault stands alone.
	


Delay and inconsistency in complaint


	
	GM did not make any complaint to her sister the next morning when the pair woke and left the motel. She did not complain to her mother either. She did not complain to anyone in authority until December 2006.
	
	
	No explanation was sought from GM as to why she did not complain to her sister. She said she did not tell her mother ""because I wasn't supposed to be where I was"". Constable Moir gave evidence that GM told her that she did not report the matter to the police at the time because she was afraid of getting into trouble for drinking.
	
	
	There was evidence that GM did complain to a friend, SF. She did not recall when that complaint was made, saying that she could not even say whether it was days, weeks or months later. (It must be remembered that she was giving evidence in May 2012 when she was aged 20 of an event which was said to have occurred 7 years earlier when she was 13.)
	
	
	Mr Lange submitted that the complaint to SF was not made until a significant time later (AWS [15]). The best SF could recall as to when the complaint was made was to say it occurred in 2005 or 2006. However, SF's recollection was that it arose in the context of a conversation with GM at school on a Monday about their respective weekends. He recalled that she told him that over the weekend she had been raped by the applicant in a hotel room in the Blue Mountains where they had been smoking and drinking. SF recalled that she was ""very emotional"".
	
	
	It used to be thought that delay in making a complaint about a sexual assault adversely affected a complainant's credibility: see for example, Kilby v The Queen [1973] HCA 30; 129 CLR 460 at 465 (Barwick CJ). That is no longer the presumption and is the reason why trial judges are required to warn juries that the absence of complaint, or delay in complaining, does not necessarily indicate that the allegation is false: s 294(2)(a) Criminal Procedure Act. Judges are also required to inform juries that there may be good reasons why a victim of a sexual assault may hesitate or refrain from making a complaint: s 294(2)(b).
	
	
	Mr Lange also identified an inconsistency between the evidence of GM and SF as to when the incident was said to have occurred. SF said that he was told by GM that the event occurred on a weekend whereas GM said that it was a school day. To my mind, such a matter of detail, bearing in mind the period of time that had elapsed, is of no consequence.
	
	
	There was also inconsistency between GM's evidence and what Constable Moir recorded in her notes of their conversation in December 2006. Constable Moir's notes were to the effect that GM said that there was only one other person in the motel room aside from the applicant and herself and that was KN. It was submitted that this was no mistake by way of the officer writing KN's name instead of KM's. There was other information recorded in the notes which supported the proposition that GM was speaking about KN – for example, that she lived above a music shop.
	
	
	In my view the evidence of Constable Moir's notes is an unsatisfactory basis to think that GM's account cannot be accepted. She was not afforded an opportunity to review the correctness of what the officer had written. It is conceivable that KN would have been mentioned in GM's account because the original intention was that KN would accompany the others on the trip to the motel. It is not implausible that Constable Moir confused the reference to the two young girls, both with a first name commencing with ""K"". Given the conversation with Constable Moir was in December 2006 and they were giving evidence about it in May 2012 it is unsurprising that neither of them had any real recollection of what was said independent of the officer’s notes.
	
	
	None of these matters required the jury to doubt the accuracy and reliability of the evidence of GM.
	


The complainant's recollection of events was “not impeccable”


	
	Mr Lange referred to a number of passages of transcript in support of the proposition that GM’s recollection of events was imperfect. The following evidence was referred to.
	
	
	GM said that the applicant spoke to her when she went into the bathroom in the motel room but she could not “exactly remember” what he said.
	
	
	She could not remember what position he was in compared to her as he was removing her pants and she could not remember all that happened after her pants were removed:
	


“I don't, like, remember all the little bits of like what happened and all that, like, all I remember is, you know, I ended up on my back and he was entering me, like, that's all I remember, like, I can't tell you how it led up to that or anything.”


	
	GM was cross-examined about her evidence that she felt “tipsy”. She also said she felt “sick and very hot”. She agreed that it was the alcohol that made her feel sick and hot. She was then asked if she was sure she was just tipsy. She replied that she was aged 13 and “wouldn’t have a clue”. There was then this evidence:
	


“Q. Looking back on it now are you sure that you were only just tipsy?

A. I don't remember.

Q. Why did you say yesterday that you were tipsy? Why didn't you say I don't remember?

A. I don't know.”


	
	Counsel also referred to a portion of the passage I have previously quoted where GM appeared to become frustrated in the course of the cross-examination and was, by the Crown Prosecutor's description, ""shutting down"" (see above at [34]). Just before the judge called for the morning adjournment, GM said that she did not remember telling police in 2006 that the applicant lay on top of her, pulled her pants down and she said to the applicant, “No”. She was asked whether that was how it happened and she said she did not remember.
	
	
	After the break, the cross-examiner returned to the issue and asked whether it was true that she “did not remember” and she replied:
	


“I don’t remember all of the little bits of it, no.”


	
	A few questions later, GM was asked for detail about how she said that her pants had been removed by the applicant and she was unable to give a precise account.
	
	
	A short time later she was asked about giving the answer in her evidence in chief I have set out above (at [111]) which included her saying, “I don't, like, remember all the little bits of like what happened and all that” and that all she remembered was ending up on her back and he was entering her. She said she did not remember saying that and she did not remember that this is in fact how it happened, that she was on her back.
	
	
	She was pressed on her earlier evidence that she ended up on her back:
	


“Q. That's different to what you said to the police in 2009, isn't it?

A. At some point, I would have been on my back. I would have, you know, been in all different positions. I don't remember how every little thing led to it. That's what I'm trying to say. I could have been in any position but I can't remember exactly, you know, what position I was in when. So - -“


	
	I note that the submissions failed to include reference to the succeeding questions and answers:
	


“Q. So do you tell us that at the moment that you say Sam El-Ali entered you, you don't know whether you were on your tummy or your back?

A. I was on my stomach. He was behind me.

Q. You were mistaken yesterday about saying you were on your back when he entered you?

A. I - I think I've gotten confused, cause I know that I was on my stomach and he was behind me on the bed. So obviously I've gotten confused and that's all I can say.”

Inconsistencies in the evidence of GM


	
	Mr Lange argued that the credibility of GM's evidence was reduced on account of inconsistencies between her testimony and what she had said in police statements.
	
	
	At the beginning of the cross-examination, GM was asked about her evidence that she got to the second motel where she had been with the applicant (the G’Day Motel) by walking (see above at [22]). In her statement of November 2011 she said she could not remember “how we all got there”. In earlier police statements she had not mentioned going to this motel at all.
	
	
	GM was asked about a passage of a police statement dated 8 January 2009 in which she had said “I remember that I met El-Ali a few days later” and she then described the Blackheath motel incident. She was asked whether she was conveying that this was the first occasion she had met the applicant. She maintained that she had previously met him at the tobacconist shop. I note that what was said in the statement prior to her saying “a few days later” was not disclosed.
	
	
	I will not repeat passages of the evidence where attempts were made to compare what was said to Constable Moir with the evidence given by GM in the trial.
	
	
	GM was cross-examined about not mentioning in her statement of 8 January 2009 that the applicant followed her into the bathroom at the Blackheath motel. She explained that she did not mention every detail; she “just wanted to get out of there”.
	
	
	It was said in GM’s statement of 8 January 2009 that the applicant “rolled me over onto my tummy”. It was asserted by the cross-examiner that this was different to what she had said in her evidence the previous day. She could not remember.
	
	
	She denied that reference to the applicant saying “You’re lucky I let you keep your virginity” was not in her 8 January 2009 statement was because he did not say that.
	
	
	Finally, counsel took GM to her 8 January 2009 statement in which there was no mention of the applicant having asked her whether she had told anyone (see above at [25]). This is what led to her apparent exasperation, saying she did not care if she was believed and that she just wanted to go home (see above at [44]).
	


Consideration


	
	Some of the above matters identified by the applicant may be thought to raise real questions about the reliability of GM's evidence. However, as the Crown submitted, it is important in determining a ground asserting the unreasonableness of a verdict to have regard to the evidence as a whole.
	
	
	It is also important to have regard to the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the witnesses; an advantage denied to this Court. For example, in his closing address to the jury the Crown Prosecutor invited the jury to recall ""the tone of her voice during cross-examination"" in relation to one witness and ""the inflection that she gave to her answers"" in relation to another. Trial counsel for the applicant invited the jury to have regard to the manner in which GM gave her evidence. It is, of course, impossible to take such matters into account when assessing the evidence from the printed pages of the transcript.
	
	
	This consideration has significance in relation to the complainant's evidence, in particular her evidence in cross-examination where it reached a point that prompted the Crown Prosecutor to describe her as ""shutting down""; a description with which the judge appeared to agree.
	
	
	The task of determining the present ground of appeal is similar to the task that recently befell the Court in Shamoun v R [2015] NSWCCA 246. I have substituted the details of the present case in the following passage from the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL:
	


""[92] No Crown case is ever perfect and there are often unanswered questions. An important factor here is the amount of time which had elapsed between the [alleged sexual assault] and the trial. That of itself provides a reasonable explanation for why, not only in relation to [GM's] evidence but that of other witnesses, there were inconsistencies and differences between the evidence at trial and statements made many years earlier.

[93] Most particularly, however, this was a case where the jury had a very significant advantage over this Court in assessing the credibility of [GM]. This case provides a good example of the qualification expressed by the plurality in M that when considering a ground asserting the unreasonableness of a verdict, the Court ‘must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses’. (M at [7] and SKA at [15]). In this case, the assessment of the credibility and reliability of the evidence of [GM] was quintessentially one for the jury to determine.""


	
	It must be remembered that the primary issue in the trial was whether GM was being truthful in saying that she had been sexually assaulted by the applicant. The defence case, implicit in the applicant’s evidence, was that she had made it up; he was never with her in a motel room in Blackheath, let alone did he sexually assault her. Accordingly, the primary issue for the jury was whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that GM was being truthful. Putting it another way, they had to consider whether it was a reasonable possibility that she was being untruthful.
	
	
	Matters that on their own might seem quite peripheral provide considerable support for the proposition that GM was a truthful witness. The applicant's evidence was that he knew her only by virtue of her being one of a number of young people who used to congregate in the area where he did his trolley collection work at a supermarket. He said he had never spoken to her and did not even know her name. If this was true, it is highly unlikely that GM would have any knowledge as to whether the applicant drank alcohol or not. But part of GM's evidence was that whilst the applicant provided alcohol for her and her sister to drink at the motel in Blackheath, he was drinking coke and did not drink any alcohol himself. This is an unlikely thing to be included in a fabricated story. But it was supported by Detective Erhardt's evidence which was that the applicant said that he did not drink alcohol. The qualification of that assertion the applicant sought to make in his evidence to the effect that he did drink alcohol but only modestly does not, in my view, detract from the point.
	
	
	Cannabis was said by GM and KM to be present in the motel room but there was no suggestion by either of them that the applicant possessed it or used it. That is unlikely in a story fabricated in order to inculpate him.
	
	
	GM first went to the police about 18 months after the assault was said to have occurred. There is no suggestion of her having had any contact or communication with the applicant in the immediately preceding period. It is therefore difficult to imagine a possible explanation for GM going to the police at that point to advance a false allegation against the applicant.
	
	
	According to Constable Moir, GM was not able to provide the name of the motel at Blackheath; she was only able to describe its location. It would seem improbable that a person would go to the police to falsely allege that they had been sexually assaulted in a motel in Blackheath but not provide a name for the motel.
	
	
	KM's evidence supported that of her sister. She confirmed that there was the occasion at the motel in Blackheath and the limited detail she was able to provide of events before and after she passed out were broadly consistent with her sister's account. She included in her evidence that when she and GM left the motel in the morning they were intending to walk to the railway station but accidentally started walking in the wrong direction before the mistake was realised and they turned around. That is a most unlikely detail to include in a made up story.
	
	
	The foregoing are not exhaustive but are indicative of it being open to the jury to accept that GM and KM were truthful witnesses.
	
	
	The same can be said in respect of the tendency witnesses. There was a general consistency in their accounts where they spoke of the same event: for example, the description of parties at the G'Day Motel; and descriptions of the back of the tobacconist shop (a place the applicant said they had never been).
	
	
	Once it is acknowledged that it was open to the jury to accept the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, particularly GM, as being truthful, it remains to consider whether there should nevertheless have been a reasonable doubt about the applicant’s guilt on the basis of inaccuracy or unreliability. In my view, the inconsistencies and failings of memory are readily explicable on the basis of GM's age and experience and the substantial period of time that had elapsed. The matters raised by the applicant, individually or in their total effect, are not such that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt.
	
	
	My overall assessment of the evidence leads me to conclude that it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the applicant's guilt. This ground must be rejected.
	


Ground 3 – error in concluding that the risk of unfair prejudice in admitting tendency evidence would be ""small"" if the ""usual directions"" were given


	
	The Crown gave notice of its intention to adduce evidence of a tendency of the applicant pursuant to s 97(1)(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). As I indicated earlier, the tendency asserted was summarised by the trial judge in her summing up:
	


""[T]he Crown says it shows the accused had a tendency to act in a particular way, which is to have a sexual interest in young girls aged about 12 to 15 years old, to ingratiate himself with such young girls by giving them compliments, cigarettes, alcohol or gifts as part of a process of grooming them for his attentions and then, with each young girl, to test how she reacted to his comments, conversations or acts to see if he could pursue taking advantage of them.""


	
	Trial counsel objected to the admissibility of the tendency evidence. A number of witnesses gave evidence on the voir dire, three of whom gave evidence at the second trial (KW, KN and LN) and one who did not (RH).
	
	
	Trial counsel for the applicant submitted that the probative value of the evidence was low because of the risk of contamination. Alternatively, it was submitted that if the evidence had significant probative value for the purposes of s 97, it did not substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect (s 101).
	
	
	The ""prejudicial effect"" identified in written submissions by trial counsel was described as follows:
	


""11 … The Crown seeks to adduce a very large body of tendency evidence, which if accepted by a jury, would ensure that the tribunal of fact could form a very detrimental view about the character of the accused.""


	
	Another matter relied upon, albeit in the context of submissions concerning severance of counts in the original indictment, was that:
	


""the jury may determine guilt on the basis of an impression that the applicant had a general sexual interest in young females rather than focusing on the necessity for proof of each actual count on the indictment.""


	
	The oral submissions of trial counsel were principally focussed on the question of probative value, it being contended that this was low because of the risk of contamination. The submissions concerning s 101 were confined to a bald assertion that the probative value did not substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect with reference made later to the quantity of evidence rendering it more onerous for the applicant to respond.
	
	
	Her Honour ruled on 7 May 2012 that the tendency evidence was admissible (and that the severance application should be refused). She referred to the relevant statutory provisions. She noted that ""prejudicial effect"" has been held to involve consideration of whether admission of the proposed evidence would risk an unfair trial: R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; 201 A Crim R 451 at [58] (Campbell JA). She also noted that ""potential prejudice involves improper use of the evidence other than for its rational effect on the probability of a fact in issue"" (see, for example, R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308 at [47] (Simpson J (as her Honour then was)).
	
	
	It is unnecessary to refer to her Honour's detailed analysis of the evidence and her reasoning in relation to the arguments advanced on the applicant's behalf concerning the risk of contamination. Her Honour concluded that the evidence had significant probative value for the purpose of s 97 and such conclusion was not challenged in this Court.
	
	
	After stating that conclusion, her Honour continued:
	


""In my view [the] significant probative value of each proposed witness's evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect the evidence may have. In my view the risk of a jury using the evidence improperly or unfairly is small if they are given the usual directions appropriate for their dealing with such evidence.

Therefore the evidence of each complainant and of each of the other witnesses nominated in the Crown's tendency notice is admissible… .""

Submissions in this Court


	
	In written submissions in this Court it was contended that ""there was a risk that the jury would not assess [the uncharged acts] thoroughly according to the criminal standard before taking the allegations into account"" and that this was a case in which ""there was a plethora of acts which might give rise to confusion or distraction from the primary issues"". (Counsel was drawing from the judgment of Basten JA in Saoud v R [2014] NSWCCA 136 at [59].)
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant referred to the discussion of the assessment of “prejudicial effect” in s 101 in the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL in Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55 at [52]-[56].
	
	
	It was submitted that the prejudice in this case was “quite substantial”. It was insufficient to merely say that the usual directions would be an adequate cure. Here, the trial concerned an allegation of a single sexual assault offence but there were a significant number of tendency evidence witnesses who spoke of various forms of misconduct spanning a period of time. In other words, it was the volume of evidence and the number of witnesses that was the primary concern. The jury could have been distracted from the obligation to consider the single charge by a general impression created by a multiplicity of allegations.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the nature of the prejudice identified by trial counsel was of the usual type associated with tendency evidence; namely that it strengthened the Crown case. This was not ""unfair prejudice"" in the sense described in the authorities. The written submissions for the Crown also cited authority for the proposition that it is legitimate, indeed appropriate, for a trial judge to have regard to the ameliorating effect of directions that may be given to a jury concerning the prejudice inherent with tendency evidence: DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 81 NSWLR 568 at [172] (Simpson J (as her Honour then was)); Regina v PWD [2010] NSWCCA 209; 205 A Crim R 75 at [90] (Beazley JA (as her Honour then was); and RH v R [2014] NSWCCA 71 at [176] (Ward JA).
	
	
	In response to the applicant's submissions in this Court concerning ""distraction"" and ""general impression"" being the principal bases of the prejudicial effect of the evidence, the Crown submitted that such matters were adequately catered for by the usual directions given in such cases.
	


Consideration


	
	The starting point for an assessment of this ground is to identify what ""the usual directions"" are that her Honour had in mind. It may be taken that they are those suggested in the Criminal Trials Bench Book published by the Judicial Commission of NSW (at [4-227] and [4-232]) and this is confirmed by the fact that there is a close correlation between the suggested directions and those that the judge in fact gave. After summarising the evidence of the tendency witnesses, her Honour directed the jury as follows:
	


""The Crown presented the evidence of those witnesses to you because the Crown says it shows the accused had a tendency to act in a particular way, which is to have a sexual interest in young girls aged about 12 to 15 years old, to ingratiate himself with such young girls by giving them compliments, cigarettes, alcohol or gifts as part of a process of grooming them for his attentions and then, with each young girl, to test how she reacted to his comments, conversations or acts to see if he could pursue taking advantage of them. The Crown seeks to rely on that evidence as evidence you can use to consider whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offence he is charged with.

You can only use the evidence of the accused having the tendency the Crown says he has on the question of his guilt of the charge on the indictment if you make two findings beyond reasonable doubt. The first finding you must make is that you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of the acts referred to in the evidence of those witnesses occurred. If you cannot find any of those acts proved beyond reasonable doubt, you must put aside any suggestion that the accused had the tendency asserted by the Crown. If you do find beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of those acts occurred, then you go on to consider the second finding you must make which is whether, from the act or acts you found proved, you can conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the tendency the Crown alleges, that is to have the sexual interest in young girls and to act on it in the way I have referred to.

If you cannot draw that conclusion beyond reasonable doubt you must put aside any suggestion that the accused had the tendency alleged, but if you find one or more of the acts alleged by any of those witnesses to have been committed by the accused proved beyond reasonable doubt, and second you can conclude beyond reasonable doubt from the proved act or acts that the accused had the tendency to act in the way the Crown alleges, you may use the fact of that tendency in considering whether the accused committed the offence he is charged with. However, you must not substitute evidence of one or other of those acts from those other witnesses for the act the subject of the charge, that is the act complained of by [GM]. In order to convict the accused of the offence on the indictment you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act alleged in that charge occurred.

Secondly, you must not reason that if the accused committed one or more of those acts alleged by the tendency witnesses that he is therefore generally a person of bad character and so he must have committed the offence charged.

Whatever you decide about the tendency evidence, that is whether you find it proved beyond reasonable doubt or not, you must still be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of each element of the offence charged in order to find the accused guilty of that offence. That means you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of [GM’s] evidence."" (Emphasis added)


	
	I do not see any concern that these directions were inadequate in dealing with the asserted prejudice. The jury were directed in clear and emphatic terms (and terms about which there is no complaint) that it was necessary to consider the evidence of other acts of the applicant and determine whether any or all of them were proved beyond reasonable doubt. The concern that because there was such a volume of evidence, the jury might have simply formed a ""general impression"" that the applicant had a sexual interest in young girls aged in their early teens is not realistic in the light of this direction. The concern that the jury might have been ""distracted"" because of the volume of this type of evidence is also not realistic in the light of the directions in the emphasised portions above. The point was confirmed later in the summing up when her Honour said, “You can only find the accused guilty if you believe [GM’s] evidence beyond reasonable doubt”.
	
	
	The underlying rationale of the applicant's submissions is that the jury might focus upon the evidence given by the tendency witnesses and be unable to properly consider the limitations on the use of that evidence as explained in the trial judge's directions. This is similar to the reasoning of the primary judge in R v PWD, about which Beazley JA said (at [90]):
	


""This reasoning fails to recognise the intelligence and focus with which juries go about their deliberations"".


	
	Sokolowskyj v R, to which the applicant made reference, provides a useful contrast. In that case the appellant had been charged with indecently assaulting an 8 year old girl in a parents' room at a shopping mall. The prosecution alleged that he had ""a tendency to have sexual urges and to act on them in public in circumstances where there was a reasonable likelihood of detection"". It based this upon evidence that five to eight years earlier he had exposed himself in public places on three occasions, on two of which he was masturbating.
	
	
	It was held that the evidence did not have significant probative value due to the generality of the tendency and the dissimilarity between the conduct alleged and that which had occurred in the past. It was also held that the prejudicial effect was not outweighed. It was said that the jury could have misused the evidence, for example by thinking that it showed that the appellant was ""a sexual deviant"" and therefore was a person likely to have committed the offence alleged. The trial judge had erred by making no assessment of the risk of misuse at all, simply stating:
	


""Having regard to the judicial directions that will be given its probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect"".


	
	Hoeben CJ at CL explained the necessity of weighing up the probative value of tendency evidence against the risk of unfair prejudice:
	


""[53] This approach involved two errors of principle. The first and most obvious was a failure to carry out the weighing exercise required by s101. The second was of the kind identified by Giles JA (with whom Hulme and Hislop JJ agreed) in R v GAC where his Honour said:

'87 The Crown further submitted that the judge was in error in not proceeding on the assumption that, if appropriate directions were given, the jury would act in accordance with the direction. It referred to McHugh J's emphasis in Gilbert v The Queen [2000] 201 CLR 414; 109 A Crim R 580 at [31] - [32] that the fundamental assumption of a criminal trial is that the jury acts on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge. Prejudicial effect, however, is to be evaluated without such a foreclosing assumption, and his Honour's remarks were not directed to the present situation.

...

89 It was well open to the trial judge to see a real risk of unfair misuse of the tendency evidence, and to conclude that directions could not be given which would satisfactorily prevent it. ....'

[54] In Qualtieri v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 95; 171 A Crim R 463 McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Howie and Latham JJ agreed) said at [80] that ""prior illegal acts by the accused, especially where the charges relate to alleged sexual acts ... would inevitably be prejudicial"". In DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272; 200 A Crim R 206 (which involved evidence of uncharged acts of child sexual abuse) McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Hidden and Fullerton JJ agreed) said at [31]:

'31 ... The risk in a particular case of an impermissible course of reasoning by the jury which cannot be averted by directions must be a consideration when determining whether the evidence should be admitted.'

[55] In Patel v The Queen [2012] HCA 29; 247 CLR 531 the plurality (French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ) said:

'113 Despite the fact that the trial judge gave careful and succinct directions as to some of the most prejudicial evidence, such as evidence of errors in surgery, it cannot be concluded that the directions were sufficient to overcome the prejudicial effects of the evidence, individually and collectively, upon the jury. The misgivings his Honour recorded in his ruling on the application to discharge the jury were well-founded.

...

128 ... In the present case, no weight can be given to the verdicts of guilty for the reason that so much irrelevant or unnecessary and prejudicial evidence was before the jury. The miscarriage of justice was grounded in the nature, significance and extent of the evidence to which the jury had been exposed. It would be expecting too much of a jury to attend to its task of determining the appellant's guilt on the four charges on the basis only of the appellant's judgment about whether to operate, putting to one side all that it had seen and heard concerning his competencies in other areas and his deficiencies as a person.

...

129 ... However, any consideration of the effect upon the jury's ability to undertake its now more confined task must take account of the evidence as a whole. The sheer extent of the prejudicial evidence in the context of a wide-ranging prosecution case is likely to have overwhelmed the jury. The jurors were not given directions that they must exclude much of it from their minds. In practical terms any such directions would have been useless.'

[56] A further consideration is this. An assumption that a judicial direction to the jury designed to minimise the risk of unfair prejudice will be completely effective would effectively prevent s 101(2) operating as a safeguard against the potential risk of miscarriages of justice arising from the admission of tendency evidence. In the present case there was a real risk that, notwithstanding directions to the jury, the jury would see the appellant as a sexual deviant who had no credibility in denying the allegation against him, was not deserving of the benefit of any reasonable doubt and was the sort of person who was likely to have committed the offence alleged against him.

[57] Members of the jury might have so proceeded subconsciously, even accepting that they would have tried to follow the directions given to them. Had his Honour carried out the weighing exercise required by s101, he should have concluded that the probative value of the evidence was not high and that it was substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. In that regard, the observations of McHugh J in Pfennig v R [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461 at 528 - 529 are pertinent:

'39 ... the proposition that the probative value of the evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect is one that can be easily misunderstood. The use of the term ""outweigh"" suggests an almost arithmetical computation. But prejudicial effect and probative value are incommensurables. They have no standard of comparison. The probative value of the evidence goes to proof of an issue, the prejudicial effect to the fairness of the trial. ... If there is a real risk that the admission of such evidence may prejudice the fair trial of the criminal charge before the court, the interests of justice require the trial judge to make a value judgment, not a mathematical calculation. The judge must compare the probative strength of the evidence with the degree of risk of an unfair trial if the evidence is admitted. Admitting the evidence will serve the interests of justice only if the judge concludes that the probative force of the evidence compared to the degree of risk of an unfair trial is such that fair minded people would think that the public interest in adducing all relevant evidence of guilt must have priority over the risk of an unfair trial.'""


	
	The trial judge in the present case did not repeat in her judgment what had been submitted to her was the prejudicial effect of the evidence. But it cannot be inferred that she was unaware of it, or had ignored it. Moreover, the fact that her Honour stated that ""the risk of the jury using the evidence improperly or unfairly is small"" indicates that she did engage in the task of weighing the probative value on the one hand with the potential prejudicial effect on the other.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that error in the manner in which the judge approached her task has been established, or that the conclusion she reached was one that was not open to her. This ground must be rejected.
	


Ground 5 – failure to provide reasons for refusing application to discharge jury


	
	The Crown Prosecutor's cross-examination of the applicant included questioning him about Ms Gooby's evidence of finding various bottles of alcohol in the room at the G'Day Motel on the occasion when he had booked a room but not used it. In the course of these questions the applicant said that he occasionally drank alcohol but only to a modest extent (""like one beer or one glass of wine, that's all""). The prosecutor reminded him that he had told Detective Erhardt in the interview that followed his arrest that he did not drink alcohol. He responded to the effect that he was not drinking at the time of that interview.
	
	
	This ground is concerned with the following exchange which occurred a short time later in the cross-examination:
	


“Q. I suggest you told the police, ""I don't even drink alcohol"", would you agree you said that to them?

A. I said that in that time I didn't drink alcohol, no.

Q. Well I suggest that you said to them--

A. She asked me if I drink alcohol. I said, ""No I don't drink alcohol"". But that doesn't mean she asked me about ten years ago if I was drinking alcohol or not.

Q. Well I suggest to you that she didn't ask you if you drank alcohol; she asked you if you sold drugs and you said--

HER HONOUR: Sorry?

BREEZE: Your Honour, I object to this line of questioning.

HER HONOUR: I don't know whether I misheard. Members of the jury I feel I have to ask you to go out for a few minutes while I have a discussion with counsel. Mr El-Ali if you'd step down and go back to the dock first before the jury go out.”


	
	The trial judge sent the jury out and in their absence clarified with the Crown Prosecutor that there would be no suggestion of the applicant having anything to do with drugs. The question Detective Erhardt asked in the interview does not appear in the transcript but the applicant's response to it was: ""I don't sell drugs, I don't take drugs, I don't even drink alcohol"". The judge identified a concern:
	


""[B]ut but the problem is if a police officer says to someone do you sell drugs a juror might think, well, why are they asking that if they didn't have information. It just opens up a whole can of worms.""


	
	It appears to have been common ground from that point that the question would not be pressed and that the jury be asked to disregard it. The judge did so when the jury returned a moment later.
	
	
	The following day there were a number of questions from the jury, one of which is presently relevant:
	


""Were drugs involved according to the Crown?""


	
	The Crown Prosecutor informed the judge that the Crown case was that the applicant was not involved in drugs. It relied upon this as supporting the credibility of the complainant, GM, and her sister, KM. They had spoken of Dean Boyd using cannabis and if they were minded to make up a story about the applicant supplying them with alcohol they might be expected to have inculpated the applicant in relation to the cannabis as well.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant made an application to discharge the jury. He contended that ""there is a risk of prejudice in that the accused won't receive a fair trial"". He said that an important part of the defence case was the applicant's prior good character which would be relied upon as supporting his credibility as well as the improbability of him committing the offence. He said that the Crown Prosecutor's question ""cuts across both of those defences or issues"".
	
	
	It was also contended that the fact that the prosecutor had asked the question would raise the issue in the minds of the jury about whether the applicant was involved in the supply of drugs. This was evident from the fact that the jury had asked the question. He submitted that nothing the judge could do in responding to the question could cure the risk of prejudice.
	
	
	The judge did not call upon the Crown Prosecutor to make any submission. The transcript simply records that at the conclusion of the applicant's counsel's submissions her Honour responded:
	


“HER HONOUR: Well that application is refused.”


	
	Discussion of housekeeping matters ensued before the jury were brought in. Her Honour responded to the jury's questions and in relation to the one concerning drugs she said:
	


“The first question was were drugs involved according to the Crown? So far as the accused is concerned no. It is not the Crown case that the accused had anything to do with drugs. The only evidence about drugs in the trial has been [GM’s] evidence that Dean Boyd went to some place and collected what she thought was cannabis. So, hopefully, that answers that question for you.”


	
	Counsel for the applicant raised no issue about that direction. There was no mention of drugs thereafter.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant in this Court described the judge's response as ""curt"". Counsel at trial had advanced a ""considered argument"" which warranted explanation as to why the application was refused.
	
	
	Various matters were raised in the written submissions as to why the jury should have been discharged. The matters relied upon at trial were reiterated. It was also submitted that the jury might have thought that the complainant's description of feeling sick and very hot in the motel room where she said she was assaulted might have been a result of being stupefied by a prohibited drug. The judge's intervention to send the jury out was described as ""abrupt"" which would only have served to highlight the impugned question. The fact that the trial had almost reached its conclusion was not a significant matter to weigh in the balance. Finally, it was contended that the direction given by the judge in answer to the jury's question was not capable of curing the prejudice because the jury had disregarded the direction she had previously given.
	


Consideration


	
	It would have been preferable for the trial judge to have articulated, even if briefly, her reason for refusing the application to discharge the jury: Harris v R [2005] NSWCCA 432; 158 A Crim R 454 at [22] (Studdert J); Evans v R [2006] NSWCCA 277; 164 A Crim R 489 at [271] (James J). But the fact of the matter is that it was open to trial counsel for the applicant to ask her Honour to provide reasons. No such request was made; and if she had been asked, it is reasonable to expect that she would have obliged. Accordingly, a complaint made now about a failure to give reasons on an issue like this loses much of its force.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the trial judge should have discharged the jury. The directions given by the judge, in their combined effect, were sufficient to allay any concern about potential prejudice. I am not prepared to infer that in the face of those directions the jury might have engaged in the type of speculation the submissions in this Court suggested.
	
	
	In his closing address to the jury the Crown Prosecutor made it abundantly clear that there was no suggestion of the applicant supplying drugs to any teenage girl. He reminded the jury that the only mention of drugs was in the evidence of KM and it was confined to Dean Boyd having cannabis. There was no suggestion of the applicant using either cannabis or alcohol.
	
	
	The primary concern of trial counsel was about the impact upon the applicant’s reliance upon his prior good character. The jury were given directions on that subject. They included that the Crown did not challenge the evidence that he was of prior good character and had no prior convictions (SU 20). There is no basis to think that the jury might not have assessed the applicant's character in the manner her Honour directed.
	
	
	This ground must be rejected.
	


Conclusion as to conviction


	
	The applicant required leave to appeal in relation to ground one. I am of the opinion that he should have such leave.
	
	
	However, I am also of the opinion that each of the grounds fail and that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.
	


Sentence


	
	The sole ground upon which leave is sought to appeal against sentence is:
	


Her Honour erred in concluding that the offence was aggravated by the presence of Dean Boyd at the time of the commission of the offence, when no cogent evidence of that fact was present.


	
	This ground concerns the following passage of the judge's sentencing remarks:
	


“I take into account that the act occurred in the presence of Dean Boyd, which adds to the humiliation of the act. I do not take into account that the act occurred in the presence of her sister, because [KM] was asleep or unconscious, due to the effects of alcohol, and so did not witness the act. Although she has since become aware of what happened, she was not traumatised by witnessing the act, which is what I construe the legislative provision as intending to address.”


	
	It was the evidence of both GM and KM that Dean Boyd was present in the motel room at all relevant times. There was no evidence that he was incapacitated and might not have been conscious or that he might have been asleep (as KM appears to have been) when the assault occurred. Whether he witnessed the assault, or was focussed upon his own activities (GM said ""he was too busy trying to fuck my sister"") is beside the point. The matter was aggravating in the sense that Mr Boyd's presence exacerbated the humiliation of the complainant.
	
	
	There is no merit in this ground.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1.   Appeal against conviction dismissed.

2.    Leave to appeal against sentence refused.

		02 December 2015",2015-12-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2768354,R v Buxton [2015] NSWDC 409,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The offender, Zachary Peter Buxton, is to be sentenced for an offence of armed robbery. When I sentence him for that matter, he asks that I take into account an offence of assault with intent to rob whilst armed with an offensive weapon.
	
	
	The two offences were what is commonly described as “bag snatching”, or at least attempted bag snatching. Such offences are not unknown to the criminal law. They have been subject of repeated consideration in these courts. As long ago as 1994, then Chief Justice Gleeson, in R v Ranse unreported NSWCCA, 8 August 1994, said this:
	


“One of the primary purposes of the system of criminal justice is to keep the peace. In this connection, the idea of peace embraces the freedom of ordinary citizens to walk the streets and to go about their daily affairs without fear of physical violence.”


	
	That is a very important consideration when sentencing the offender for what he has done.
	
	
	People are entitled to go out about their daily affairs, without fear that they will be robbed by a knife wielding bandit. The consequences for victims of such offences are, no doubt, significant. Not everyone, of course, is affected the same way, but a common effect of such offences is that the victims of them are frightened to go out, less willing to go about their daily affairs, less able to enjoy the simple act of walking home from a hotel in the evening.
	
	
	On 25 April last year two women were visiting Newcastle from Sydney. They were staying at a hotel in Islington. They had been at the Kent Hotel in Hamilton when, at about 5.30 in the evening, they were walking back to where they were staying. They were approached by the offender. He was wearing a black hooded jumper and had dark hair and a dark unkempt beard.
	
	
	He stood about a metre away from them and produced a knife which was between 15 and 20 centimetres long. He said, “Bags, ladies, please.” Notwithstanding the politeness of that request, it was clearly a threat backed up with the production of the knife.
	
	
	One of the ladies ran across the road, yelling “Run” to her companion. She also screamed out, “Help”. The other lady threw her bag at the offender and also ran across the road. Fortunately, there were three young men across the road and they were told what happened. Two of them saw the offender with a lady’s handbag. They ran after him. They saw him crouched over the bag and yelled at him to drop it. The offender got up, faced the men and then ran away. The bag was returned to its owner who checked and found nothing was missing.
	
	
	When police arrived they found a black mobile phone. This turned out to be registered to the offender. He had clearly dropped it in the kafuffle.
	
	
	Only a very short time later that evening, the same good Samaritans were on the balcony of the Kent Hotel when they saw the offender again. They called police, told police where the offender was and watched until he was arrested. Police found a black-handled fishing knife, which was probably the one used in the offences I have described.
	
	
	These were serious examples of a serious offence. The offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon carries with it a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. It is important to bear that maximum penalty in mind. Of course, when sentencing for an armed robbery matter attention immediately turns to the guideline decision of R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A CrimR 149, but Henry in no way sets out the limit. Regard must be had to the maximum penalty as well as the Henry guideline in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on someone who has committed such an offence.
	
	
	The offender has an unfortunate upbringing. The main problem was his parents’ attitude to drugs. His parents separated when he was about five and he was raised for the most part by his paternal grandmother. However, his father’s influence was, at least in some areas, not a positive one. His father was a drug user and he provided drugs and alcohol to the offender from a very young age; indeed, introducing him to cannabis at the age of but five. His grandmother tried hard to keep him on the straight and narrow but, as is obvious from what has occurred in the offender’s life up until now, she was unsuccessful. Part of the problem, according to a psychiatric report tendered today, was the significant emotional neglect which the offender reports, especially caused by his father’s substance abuse problems.
	
	
	In the other hand, not too much can be made of the offender’s background. This was not a case where there is any suggestion that he was exposed to domestic violence on a daily basis. This is not a case where he was forced to live on the streets from a young age. He had a positive person in his life; his grandmother. He does report being subject to some physical abuse by her, but how much of that was perhaps overenthusiastic chastisement and how much was serious physical abuse is difficult to determine.
	
	
	That is not to underplay the effect of drugs in the offender’s life. One thing Henry looks at, as well as providing a guideline sentence for the commonly occurring offence of armed robbery, concerns the circumstances in which addiction to drugs can be a mitigating feature. One such circumstance is when the decision to first take drugs is not really one of personal choice. It could hardly be said that the offender made a personal choice to commence using cannabis when it was his father who gave it to him at the age of five. The problems which the offender has faced and which he has caused society have, in a large part, flowed from that early exposure to drugs. He is an enthusiastic drug user. There is at least the possibility that this drug use has led to thought disorders such as psychosis which have been present in the offender from time to time.
	
	
	Mr Bickford, who appears for the offender today, submits that one aspect of the relevance of the offender’s drug use, and its connection with his offending, is that it may suggest that the offender’s decision to commit offences such as these, and I will be referring to some aspects of his criminal history, is not born of some evil disposition but is a result of his drug addiction. Of course, another aspect of relevance of that is that it affects his prospects of rehabilitation. If the offender’s drug addiction can be dealt with, it is much less likely that he will commit offences in the future.
	
	
	It is a significantly aggravating feature that the offender was on parole for an offence of aggravated robbery with wounding at the time he committed the offence for which I must specifically sentence him. The Crown has tendered the statement of facts in relation to that matter. It was a most serious offence. It involved the offender and others setting upon a seventeen year old boy who ended up being stabbed and requiring open heart surgery. Of course, he is not to be punished again for an offence for which he has already been punished, but that the offender would produce a knife and threaten two women with it after having been sentenced for an earlier offence, and whilst on parole for that offence, does suggest in very concrete terms the increased need for an element of personal deterrence to be built into the sentence that I must ultimately impose upon the offender.
	
	
	The offender has other robbery offences on his criminal history too; three armed robberies in 2008. This is one of those cases where the offender has demonstrated a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law which must be reflected in the sentence.
	
	
	Having mentioned that the offender was on parole, I should make it clear that I do regard that as a significantly aggravating feature but have to be careful not to double-count that factor by commencing the sentence earlier than is thus appropriate. I have chosen the date of the offender’s arrest as the date on which the sentence I will announce will commence but taking into account in selecting the length of that sentence that he was on parole for an earlier offence of robbery in which a knife was also used.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty, not at the earliest opportunity but on the day his trial was due to commence, having alerted the Court earlier through his lawyers that he would be pleading guilty a few days beforehand. In those circumstances, the sentence I will impose upon the offender is 15 per cent less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	Mr Bickford relied on the principles to be found in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228. He summarised them accurately in his written submissions. However, he made no submission, indeed conceded that it could not be said that his moral culpability should be reduced. I do not regard the offender’s mental illness as being a significant reason to reduce the need for general deterrence to any large extent. There is no real suggestion in any material that the custodial sentence that must be imposed upon the offender would weigh more heavily on him, especially as he is apparently not using drugs whilst in custody and his thought disorders might be thought, therefore, to have improved.
	
	
	I do not want to underestimate the effect of the offender’s upbringing on the sentence that I will shortly announce. Who knows how Mr Buxton’s life would have turned out had he not been introduced to drugs by his father at the age of five? It is undeniable that that feature of the offender’s early life has remained an important factor in how his life has turned out. It was not his decision to commence using drugs. It is probably his decision to keep using them but even that decision has to be looked at in the context of the fact that his drug addiction is not really one of his own making.
	
	
	Not without some hesitation, I will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour. My hesitation arises from the circumstance that he did not take advantage of the leniency that was offered to him by a finding of special circumstances made when he was sentenced for the aggravated robbery with wounding matter. He committed this offence only about six months after having been released from custody, in the context of having consumed a large quantity of drugs. However, I will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour, primarily for two reasons; the effect of accumulation of this sentence, and the offender’s need for assistance to overcome his drug addiction. If he can be assisted to give up his life of drugs, then not only will he benefit but perhaps, more importantly, the community will as well.
	
	
	A significant sentence of imprisonment is required, and that is what I will now impose.
	
	
	The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of five years to date from 25 April 2014 and a head sentence of eight years. The non-parole period will thus expire on 24 April 2019, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

		31 August 2016",2015-12-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768356,R v Borg [2015] NSWDC 393,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Jason James Borg stands for sentence as a consequence of adhering to pleas of guilty to two charges. The Crown accepts that the offender pleaded guilty to each of the two charges at the earliest possible opportunity and therefore he is entitled to the maximum discount on the sentence because of the utilitarian value of his early pleas of guilty. That discount is 25%.
	
	
	The first offence was that on 11 February 2014 at Arncliffe he did break and enter a shop known as Elzein Bakery situated at 1A Firth Street, Arncliffe, and in the said building did commit a serious indictable offence, namely, stealing in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that he was in company with another person, Christos Filipopoulos. The thing to note about that offence is that it was committed shortly after 12.20am on Friday 11 February 2014. The bakery was then unattended. The offender and an accomplice forced the doors of the bakery inward, which caused the glass panels in the doors to crack. They then entered the bakery and the co-offender removed four charity tins, each containing money from the counter area, and handed them to the offender who placed them in a bag. After briefly inspecting the counter and the cash register, the pair left the building.
	
	
	The owner of the bakery, Mr Elzein, estimated the damage to the doors and lock at the front of the premises to be $500. He also made an estimate of the cash contained in the four charity tins, but the estimate is absurd and clearly grossly exaggerated, for what purpose I know not. However, the fact that the offender took charity tins can only be described as a “low act”, words that Mr Borg himself used to describe this offence, when being interviewed for the first time about the crimes, by Corrective Services personnel preparing the original pre-sentence report. It is highly likely that the damage to the bakery doors resulted in a greater economic loss than the theft of the charity tins.
	
	
	The second offence was an offence of larceny committed shortly after 3pm on 21 February 2014 from the Woolworths supermarket at Kingsgrove. The agreed facts indicate that the offender was in company with Mr Filipopoulos on this occasion as well. The pair managed to load a shopping trolley with $982.34 worth of groceries and left the supermarket without paying for them. The stolen goods included a large number of caffeine‑charged “energy” drinks, a large amount of canned tuna, a dozen muffins, chips, popcorn, two kilograms of Milo and one kilogram of apples. The bulk of the stolen goods, the valuable stolen goods, were the large amount of energy drinks and the large amount of tuna.
	
	
	Mr Filipopoulos was charged with the same offences, but was discharged at committal on the charge of aggravated breaking, entering and stealing. He pleaded guilty to larceny at the Kingsgrove Woolworths supermarket. He was placed on a bond to be of good behaviour for 18 months.
	
	
	The offender was arrested on 24 February 2014 and remained in custody until being granted bail by my colleague, Hanley DCJ, on 1 April 2015. All told, the offender spent one year, five weeks and two days in custody, essentially for the crime of aggravated breaking, entering and committing a serious indictable offence. That is a serious crime. The maximum penalty is 20 years’ imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of five years. However, considering that these were commercial premises which were not occupied at the time of the breaking and entry, that there was little damage to the premises and there was a small amount taken, and that there was no-one present who could have been alarmed by the fact that the offender was in company, this offence is at the very bottom of the range for an offence of aggravated breaking, entering and stealing.
	
	
	The offender is currently 45 years old. At the time of these offences he was 43 years old. He has a very lengthy criminal history which commences with a driving offence at the age of 17. The first relevant charge appears to be one that was laid on 22 July 1991 when the offender was 21. The charge was goods in custody for which he obtained the benefit of s 556A of the Crimes Act 1900, the then equivalent of s 10. However, at the same age he appeared before this Court for supplying a prohibited drug and was placed on the equivalent of a s 9 bond to be of good behaviour for a period of three years. Thereafter the offender committed a number of offences of relating to stealing such as goods in custody, larceny, possession of housebreaking implements, entering a building with intent to commit an indictable offence, receiving stolen goods, trespass, breaking and entering with intent to steal and breaking and entering and stealing. Interspersed with those sorts of charges have been charges relating to the possession of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	The offender’s criminal record extends over 19 pages. He has been in and out of gaol since 1997. His first period of imprisonment appears to be from 15 April 1997 to 13 February 1998. His next period of imprisonment was from 14 August 2002 until 12 February 2003. There was another period of imprisonment from 11 July 2003 to 9 February 2004, a further period of imprisonment between 7 February 2005 and 26 April 2005, then from 2 March 2006 to 16 June 2006 when he was granted bail, but was put back into custody on 27 November 2006 until being granted bail again on 8 March 2007, but was taken back into custody on 9 April 2007 and not granted parole until 16 July 2009. There was a further period of over eight months imprisonment in 2010, a further four months imprisonment in 2011 and another period of four months imprisonment in the early part of 2012 and then another period of imprisonment from 9 April 2012 until 29 February 2013 and then one from 13 March 2013 until 12 June 2013 prior to his being again arrested on 24 February 2014.
	
	
	The offender’s criminal record reflects his longstanding addiction to illicit drugs and the need to obtain money to support his drug habit and also, the pre‑sentence reports tell me, his keeping company with other persons who are addicted to drugs whom he had, on one view, assisted, but on another view of it, been exploited by. Various attempts over the years to wean himself from his illicit drug habit have failed. The offender commenced using alcohol at the age of 14 and became a heavy consumer of alcohol until the age of 17. He started using cannabis at the age of 13 and gave that up at the age of 15 because it interfered with his asthma, however, by the age of 20 had commenced using heroin intravenously until going into the methadone programme in his thirties. He, however, also used amphetamines commencing at the age of 15 and up until the time of his incarceration on 20 February 2014 had been giving himself intravenous injections of amphetamines daily.
	
	
	The first pre-sentence report tells me that the offender had a, “long standing unresolved substance abuse issues and a correlating criminal history”. After being granted bail by Judge Hanley the offender commenced an opiate replacement treatment programme. He admitted to using heroin within the two weeks of commencing that programme because he forgot to attend to obtain his usual dose of the opiate replacement. However, that has not continued. The offender eventually completed the SMART recovery group programme. He has been attending Narcotics Anonymous and continues on the opiate replacement treatment programme. The pre-sentence reports tell me that the offender has been trying “really hard” to get himself off the illicit drugs.
	
	
	In the pre-sentence report of 4 September 2015 it is recorded the offender was working six days per week as a labourer. The most recent report, that prepared for today’s sentencing hearing, tells me that the offender is currently working three days per week, the reduction in the number of days he works being due to work availability. The employer of the offender describes the offender as “a good worker” and he is well‑regarded by his employer, who was prepared to continue to support him as he knows that the offender is actively addressing his drug addiction problem.
	
	
	Community Corrections believe that the offender would benefit from a period of supervision by Community Corrections to assist him with his determination to stay away from illicit drugs and support the steps he has taken in that regard, namely, to continue to attend Narcotics Anonymous and to participate in the opiate replacement program.
	
	
	The Crown has submitted, very properly in my view, that this is a case in which there are special circumstances to break the statutory nexus between the head sentence and the non-parole period.
	
	
	The offender’s criminal history of course does not permit the Court to allow any leniency, but the fact that the offender is now actively addressing his drug addiction, has been drug-free now for eight months and prior to that was in custody for over a year in which, if drugs were available to him, they would have been hard to obtain, indicates that there is a good chance on this occasion of the offender’s staying away from illicit drugs in the future, and therefore staying away from breaching the criminal law.
	
	
	I have come to the view that, allowing for the 25% discount, the appropriate head sentence for the aggravated breaking, entering and stealing is a period of two years and that the time spent in custody, thus far one year, five weeks and two days, is an adequate non-parole period. The offender will, accordingly, be entitled to stay on parole until the expiry of his sentence on 23 February 2016.
	
	
	In respect of the second charge, the charge of larceny, I believe it appropriate to impose a fixed term of imprisonment of six months, to be wholly concurrent with the sentence for the greater offence.
	
	
	Jason James Borg, on the charge that on 11 February 2014 at Arncliffe you did break and enter the shop, Elzein Bakery, situated at 1A Firth Street, Arncliffe, and in the said building did commit a serious indictable offence, namely, stealing in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that you were in company with another person, you are convicted, I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one year, five weeks and two days commencing on 24 February 2014 and expiring on 1 April 2015. I impose a further period of imprisonment of 46 weeks and five days, to commence upon the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring on 23 February 2016. The total sentence is therefore two years, comprising the non-parole period and the balance of the sentence.
	
	
	I have found special circumstances. You are to be released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period. You are to report to the City Community Corrections Office within seven days.
	
	
	On the charge that on 21 February 2014 at Kingsgrove in this State you did steal certain property of the value of $984.34, the property of Woolworths Kingsgrove, you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment for six months commencing on 24 February 2014 and expiring on 23 August 2014.

		19 May 2016",2015-12-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768360,Application by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2015] NSWSC 1843,"Judgment (EX TEMPORE – REVISED)

Introduction


	
	By summons filed on Thursday 13 November 2015 the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police seeks various orders under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act) including a restraining order pursuant to s 19 of the Act and an order for custody and control of the property pursuant to s 38 of the Act.
	
	
	In support of the summons the Commissioner, for whom Mr Staples appears, relies on the affidavit of Jeffrey Aaron Kokles sworn 12 November 2015. Federal Agent Kokles deposes in paragraph one of the affidavit that he is a member of the Australian Federal Police.
	
	
	The summons and the affidavit were served on Lap Keung Ng, who is an interested person in the making of the orders. Mr Ng is presently in custody at the Kirkconnell Correctional Centre having pleaded guilty to one count of the offence of dealing with money or other property reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime worth in excess of $100,000 against s 400.9 of the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Criminal Code). On 9 October 2015 Mr Ng was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment to commence on 7 April 2015. He was ordered to serve a minimum of 12 months and to be released after serving 12 months upon entering into a recognizance to be of good behaviour for 12 months.
	
	
	I am satisfied, on the basis of the affidavit of Erica Jayne Last sworn 2 December 2015, that Mr Ng has been served with the summons and affidavit. He has, however, neither appeared nor given any indication, as I understand it, that he wishes to appear today, as could have been arranged by audio visual link had he expressed a wish to do so.
	


The background facts


	
	In 2015, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) began an investigation into suspected money laundering being undertaken by a group of Chinese students who had been observed depositing large sums of cash and then remitting the sums overseas.
	
	
	As referred to above, Mr Ng pleaded guilty to an offence against s 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code. According to the Agreed Facts filed at the sentence hearing on 9 October 2015:
	



	
	At about 2.05pm on 7 April 2015, the AFP stopped a red Toyota Echo motor vehicle (the Vehicle) of which Mr Ng was the sole occupant and registered owner. They seized $511,855 cash from the vehicle. Mr Ng was arrested.
	
	
	At about 6.50pm on 7 April 2015, the AFP executed a search warrant at the flat in Rhodes where Mr Ng lived. The total amount of cash located in the flat was $3,653,020.
	


Legislative requirements

Section 19 of the Act


	
	The legislative requirements for a restraining order are set out in s 19 of the Act which provides that a court with proceeds jurisdiction, which includes this Court, must, if certain conditions are fulfilled, make an order that the property not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person. The Court’s obligation to make an order with respect to serious offences is subject to satisfaction that an appropriate undertaking has been given: s 21 of the Act.
	
	
	Mr Staples has provided the Commissioner’s usual undertaking as to damages and costs, which I regard as an appropriate undertaking pursuant to s 21 of the Act.
	
	
	Section 19 provides:
	


“Restraining orders—property suspected of being proceeds of indictable offences etc.

When a restraining order must be made

(1) A court with *proceeds jurisdiction must order that:

(a) property must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person; or

(b) property must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person except in the manner and circumstances specified in the order;

if:

(c) a *proceeds of crime authority applies for the order; and

(d) there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is:

(i) the *proceeds of a *terrorism offence or any other *indictable offence, a *foreign indictable offence or an *indictable offence of Commonwealth concern (whether or not the identity of the person who committed the offence is known); or

(ii) an *instrument of a *serious offence; and

(e) the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an *authorised officer stating that the authorised officer suspects that:

(i) in any case—the property is proceeds of the offence; or

(ii) if the offence to which the order relates is a serious offence—the property is an *instrument of the offence;

and including the grounds on which the authorised officer holds the suspicion; and

(f) the court is satisfied that the *authorised officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion stated in the affidavit on reasonable grounds.

Property that a restraining order may cover

(2) The order must specify, as property that must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with, the property specified in the application for the order, to the extent that the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that that property is:

(a) in any case—*proceeds of the offence; or

(b) if the offence to which the order relates is a *serious offence—an *instrument of the offence.

Refusal to make a restraining order

(3) Despite subsection (1), the court may refuse to make a *restraining order in relation to an *indictable offence that is not a *serious offence if the court is satisfied that it is not in the public interest to make the order.

Note: A court can also refuse to make a restraining order if the Commonwealth refuses to give an undertaking: see section 21.

Restraining order need not be based on commission of a particular offence

(4) The reasonable grounds referred to in paragraph (1)(d) need not be based on a finding as to the commission of a particular offence.

Risk of property being disposed of etc.

(5) The court must make a *restraining order even if there is no risk of the property being disposed of or otherwise dealt with.”


	
	The conditions the fulfilment of which entitles the Commissioner to an order under s 19(1)(a) or (b) are set out in 19(1)(c), (d), (e) and (f) of the Act. These will be considered in turn.
	


Section 19(1)(c): application made by a proceeds of crime authority


	
	Section 19(1)(c) requires that the application is made by a proceeds of crime authority. The Commissioner falls within the definition in s 338 of the Act. Accordingly, the condition in s 19 (1)(c)(i) is fulfilled.
	


Section 19(1)(d): reasonable grounds for suspicion


	
	Section 19 (1) (d) requires there to be reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is relevantly the proceeds of an indictable offence of the Commonwealth or an instrument (as defined by s 329 of the Act) of a serious offence. The relevant offence is an offence contrary to s 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code. It is contained in Part 10.2 of the Criminal Code which deals with money-laundering. As such, it is a serious offence within the meaning of (a)(ii) of the definition of a serious offence in s 338 of the Act.
	
	
	Having read the affidavit of Federal Agent Kokles, I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property referred to in Schedule 1 (the cash found in Mr Ng’s vehicle) and Schedule 2 (the cash found in Mr Ng’s flat at Rhodes) of the summons and to the minute of order, are proceeds of an indictable offence, or an offence within the meaning of s 19(1)(d)(i) and (ii).
	
	
	I am satisfied on the basis of that affidavit that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property referred to in the two Schedules are the proceeds of indictable offences.
	


Section 19(1)(e): the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer


	
	Section 19(1)(e) of the Act provides that a condition of the making of the order is that the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer who states that the authorised officer suspects that the property is proceeds of the offence. As referred to above, the definition of authorised officer under s 338 of the Act includes a member of the AFP if authorised by the Commissioner. The evidence establishes that the Commissioner, by authorisation dated 26 August 2013, authorised all members of the AFP to be authorised officers under the Act. Accordingly, Federal Agent Kokles is an authorised officer.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the condition in s 19(1)(e)(i) is fulfilled by the affidavit of Federal Agent Kokles sworn 12 November 2015. He sets out the grounds for his suspicion in paragraphs [10]-[38] of the affidavit and summarises those grounds in paragraphs [39] of the affidavit.
	


Section 19(1)(f): reasonable grounds


	
	I am also required, by reason of s 19(1)(f), to be satisfied that the authorised officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion stated in the affidavit on reasonable grounds. I am satisfied that the matters set out in paragraphs [10]-[38] of the affidavit and summarised in paragraph [39] of the affidavit. provide sufficient basis by way of reasonable grounds for the suspicion to which Federal Agent Kokles deposes.
	


Conclusions

Conclusion regarding a restraining order


	
	For these reasons I am persuaded that I am obliged to make an order under s 19(1)(b) of the Act with respect to the cash sums referred to in Schedules 1 and 2 to the summons and to the short minutes of order.
	


Other orders sought

Custody and control order: s 38 of the Act


	
	I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make an order under s 38 of the Act that the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy is to take custody and control of the property specified in both Schedules 1 and 2, being the sums referred to.
	


Orders


	
	For those reasons, and noting the undertaking on behalf of the plaintiff as to damages and costs, I make the orders in terms of paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the short minutes of order which I will sign and date with today’s date.
	
	
	I make the following orders:
	


UPON THE PLAINTIFF PROVIDING ITS USUAL UNDERTAKING AS TO DAMAGES AND COSTS:

2768362,R v Youssef [2015] NSWDC 388,"SENTENCE


	
	CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISION ACTIVATED
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Youssef can you hear me?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes I can your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Did you hear me say I tell people in advance what sentence is to be imposed?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: In your case I propose to sentence you to 4 years 6 months imprisonment, I have given you a discount of 10% which I will explain in a moment for the plea of guilty. I am fixing a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months, I am dating the sentence from 24 January 2014 so that is to be part way through, almost half way through, the breach of parole period, the balance of sentence that you were required to serve. Your non-parole period will expire on 23 July 2016, that is July next year, on 23 July, the balance of sentence will be two years. That will expire on 23 July 2018 and the Parole Authority will have to make the relevant decision. I will give my reasons. I will repeat what I have just said. Your non-parole period, bearing in mind that I am back-dating your sentence for January 2014, expires on 23 July 2016, do you understand that.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes. Yes I do.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you.
	
	
	The accused, Hamzeh Youssef was arraigned before me on a charge alleging that he did, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, rob Gregory Brown of a sum of cash at Banksia on 24 September 2013. He pleaded not guilty to that charge, the charge brought pursuant to s 97(2) Crimes Act 1900 but pleaded guilty to an alternative charge, particularising the same place and date that he, whilst armed with an offensive weapon, rob Gregory Brown of a sum of cash. That is an offence contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900, it carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The introductory remarks I made to Mr Youssef I would ask to be incorporated into these remarks on judgment.
	
	
	I will come back to the issue of the calculation of the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, but there is some background to the plea entered on 16 March that needs to be noted. The accused was arraigned with other accused on 10 March 2015. I just pause for a moment, Madam Crown, I just observe that the person who dated the final indictment dated it 16 March 2017, I hope we are not that far into the future. Anyway, the accused was originally arraigned on 10 March 2015 with other accused. I conducted a voir dire examination in relation to the admissibility of the accused’s electronically recorded interview conducted on 24 September 2013, the accused being arrested by police shortly after the offence to which he pleaded guilty, that is within an hour or so. The voir dire examination extended to 12 March and I reserved my decision to go on with voir dire examinations in relation to admissibility of other electronically recorded interviews. The accused, as I said, pleaded guilty to the charge for which he is to be sentenced on 16 March 2015 and the judgment which I had already arrived at, but not reduced to writing, I delivered on 17 March 2015, indicating that I would have admitted the accused’s electronic interview.
	
	
	I set out this history because in the course of submissions before me by learned counsel for the accused and the Crown I suggested wrongly, to learned counsel for the accused, that Mr Youssef had pleaded guilty only after he became aware that I was proposing to admit his record of interview or electronically recorded record of interview. In fact I have gone back to pp 67 and 68 of 12 March 2015 and it is quite clear, even though I was reserved on the matter, Ms Swift indicated that she was seeking instructions in relation to a matter that she was discussing with the Crown and that Mr Youssef’s matter may become a short matter. I even suggested at the top of p 68, “would it assist you if I told you what ruling I am going to make in relation to the matter?”. But she declined my kind offer of assistance by indicating what my judgment would be. It is thus apparent that the decision to plead guilty was taken without knowledge of the decision I was to make in relation to the recorded interview. Ultimately it does not make a substantial difference to the issue of the measurement of the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, a matter which I will discuss shortly.
	
	
	I have an agreed statement of facts on sentence and that states, as the evidence on the voir dire revealed, that at about 3am on Tuesday 24 September 2013, the victim, Mr Brown, was performing his work as a delivery driver. He attended upon a shop in Railway Parade, Banksia, to deliver crates of fresh bread. After he delivered all the crates, he was loading returned bread, as it is described, into his delivery truck, he noticed the prisoner walk past him on the footpath. He provided a description of the prisoner including a description of him wearing a red hooded jumper. Mr Brown went about his work and he eventually noticed another man climbing out of the passenger side of his, that is Mr Brown’s, delivery truck and he provided a description of that person ultimately to police.
	
	
	When Mr Brown’s attention was drawn to this matter the prisoner removed a small silver-coloured cigarette lighter from the front pocket of his red hooded jumper with his right hand. He walked towards Mr Brown and pointed the cigarette lighter towards Mr Brown’s leg, the other man ran off. Mr Youssef said to Mr Brown “I want your wallet”. Mr Brown was still holding crates of bread in his arms and his wallet was in his back pocket. Mr Brown, naturally enough, attempted to back away from Mr Youssef and Mr Youssef said “I’ll shoot you in the leg if you don’t give me your wallet”. At that time Mr Brown believed, not unreasonably, that the cigarette lighter was a gun, I have got a photograph of the cigarette lighter. It appears to all intents and purposes to be a hand gun although it is very small by comparison to a real hand gun. Mr Youssef grabbed Mr Brown on his left shoulder and attempted to remove the wallet from Mr Brown’s back pocket while still holding the lighter. Mr Brown dropped the crates he was holding and then removed his own wallet. Mr Brown took his bankcard from his wallet and said, “I’m keeping this”, the prisoner replied, “Give me your money”. Mr Brown took two $50 notes from his wallet and handed them to Mr Youssef, Mr Youssef walked around to the driver’s side of the delivery truck and said to Mr Brown, “I want all the money that’s in the truck”. Mr Brown, not unnaturally, replied “We don’t carry any cash”. One would hardly think that a man delivering bread around the back streets of the St George district would be, at 3 o‘clock in the morning, carrying cash so he could provide change to various merchants upon whom he was required to attend. Mr Youssef then left and Mr Brown heard a car drive away.
	
	
	At about 3.30am police attended and eventually observed a motor vehicle parked in a nearby area, the prisoner and other young men with him had not gone very far. The prisoner was spoken to and the prisoner was wearing what I would describe generally as the distinctive red top about which Mr Brown no doubt gave some information. Mr Youssef had in his possession $130 including 2 $50 notes. The vehicle was searched and in the back of the police vehicle two black hooded jumpers were found which are of no moment in this case, and approximately 5 metres away from where the vehicle was parked, police located “a small silver pistol” and a glass pipe commonly known as an ‘ice pipe’. The pistol was in fact a silver cigarette lighter, as I said. It measured approximately 9 centimetres in overall length and displayed some scaled down features that are common to Beretta self-loading pistols. There is no suggestion of course that Mr Brown was an expert in hand guns. It was clearly a very good “replica” but it was, as I said, somewhat smaller than what one would ordinarily expect a pistol to be if one had some knowledge of the matter.
	
	
	The record-of-interview conducted with the prisoner back at the Kogarah Police Station, which I admitted, involved the accused answering a number of questions where he denied any knowledge of the offence. He gave the police, if I be so bold to say so, a rather elaborate account of his movements, that he had no connection with the silver cigarette lighter, the circumstances in which he had seen a silver cigarette lighter at another place, the fact that he and his colleagues, the two brothers that were with him, were at the “wrong place at the wrong time” and other matters. The prisoner was charged in relation to this matter. He undertook a forensic procedure. He agreed to a photographic identification parade but Mr Brown, when he viewed the array of photographs, could not select any photographs during this procedure.
	
	
	Unfortunately for Mr Youssef, in the sense that he is now before me, the cigarette lighter was later forensically examined and DNA recovered was found to have the same profile as the DNA profile of Mr Youssef. I have details about the likelihood of that occurring or not. An examination was made of other clothing relating to the other young men but it is not a matter about which I should be concerned because ultimately, the brothers were not concerned with this sentencing procedure.
	
	
	The prisoner was born, according to his criminal history, on 18 February 1981. He has findings of guilt in the Children’s Court going back to 1995, some offences of dishonesty, drug supply and street offences and the like. He has a finding of guilt in the Children’s Court in 2000 for robbery in company. He has findings of guilt in the Local Court I would take it when he was an adult for receiving stolen property and escaping from police custody for which he received what were then recognisances to be of good behaviour. He also in 2002 was convicted of resisting police and possessing prohibited drug for which he received short terms of imprisonment, suspended pursuant to the then recently introduced s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 hereinafter to be referred to as ‘the Act’. He has findings of guilt in 2002 for larceny for which he received a community service order and in respect of which he was called up.
	
	
	He has in 2005 some offences in relation to an unregistered motor vehicle of no moment whatsoever. However, after a finding of guilt in relation to breaking, entering and stealing in 2002, for which he received another period of imprisonment, that is, 12 months suspended pursuant to s 12 and, after further traffic matters not of great significance in 2008, the offender in 2012 was convicted in the Sydney District Court on 8 March 2013 on an offence of aggravated break and entering with intent in company for which he received a term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 25 May 2012 concluding on 24 May 2014, with a non-parole period of one year which would have concluded on 24 May 2013. He thus would have been automatically released to parole.
	
	
	It can be seen in relation to that matter, of course, that with the timing of this offence in September 2013 the prisoner was in breach of his parole and, in fact, I have information relating to the fact that after being in custody in relation to the current matter from 24 September his parole was revoked on 26 October. The balance of parole expired in May 2014. I will deal with the implications of fixing a sentence in respect of an offence committed while subject to parole and where the parole has been revoked at a later time but what I will be doing, as I foreshadowed by the orders that I outlined to the prisoner, I will be backdating the sentence that I impose to a period of time during which the prisoner was serving that revocation of parole in accordance with some of the observations of Simpson J in the decision of Callaghan Court of Criminal Appeal 2006. Her Honour, I point out in passing, made it very clear that where an aggravating factor is found under the Act that a person is in breach of conditional liberty and the court is aware of the fact that the breach of conditional liberty led to a revocation of parole, the court has to be very careful that it does not ‘double dip’ in taking into account the aggravating factor but not give credit for a part of the period at least during which the prisoner, by reason of the breach of parole, was required to serve a period of imprisonment. It is a matter of discretion, I understand, but the discretion must be carefully exercised.
	
	
	I have a report from the Community Correction Service. It is not a particularly glowing report. It reflects upon the sporadic supervision of the prisoner and his failure to respond over a period of time to various orders made by courts. It notes that the prisoner has given some history of suffering symptoms of depression and anxiety. He has had mental health intervention whilst in the community and was prescribed Xanax, although I understand from time to time he has abused prescribed drugs, and also contact with Justice Health confirmed that he was being prescribed medication to manage “self- reported depression and anxiety.” A formal diagnosis has not been made of the prisoner.
	
	
	The prisoner told the Community Correction Service that at the time of the offence, “he was under the influence of ice and that he had initially pleaded not guilty as he could not recall committing the offence.” This was a matter of some discussions in terms of the timing of the plea. Seeing video evidence, particularly as I would understand it conducted or admitted during the voir dire examination, persuaded him that he should plead guilty. My examination of the transcript reveals that he had indicated a willingness to plead guilty before I gave my judgment. He is at medium to high risk of re-offending. He has a large number of issues that need to be addressed self-evidently from alcohol and drug issues, emotional issues and attitude issues.
	
	
	He has been at Parklea Correctional Centre and has given evidence before me about matters that arise from this report, particularly institutional conduct offences over a period of time between January 2014 and April 2015. He is also reported by Community Corrections to have “behaviour towards staff members (that has not been) satisfactory” and “displaying aggression towards medical staff at Parklea Correctional Centre.” He has given evidence about these matters and I am very mindful in a gaol setting that procedural fairness and the like do not have the same level of attention as they do in courts. But it seems to me, with respect, that here where there is smoke there is fire and the way the prisoner sought to explain himself seemed to underline the fact that whilst it may be that he had drugs in his ‘possession’ that he had not actually possessed, but had been left behind by another inmate.
	
	
	He has not displayed the best of attitudes to Correctional staff and this is a matter he has to address because, as I point out in relation to his evidence later, the prisoner seems to have a single-minded view of his own conduct which does not necessarily accord with the objective facts. He has a child who is in the care of his grandmother. The child was abandoned by the mother, apparently shortly after the child’s birth, and as I understand it that child is now aged about nine years.
	
	
	Thus, it can be seen, as I point out later, that the presence of the son in the offender’s life, whilst it is important to him and has been a feature of his subjective circumstances, yet he has still continued to offend, particularly in 2012 in respect of the matter for which he was on parole when he committed this offence. In respect of this offence, and his devotion to his son, as he would express it, has not stopped him using prohibited drugs which has contributed to his offending.
	
	
	He is resident with his family, his mother particularly. He has had a very strained relationship with his father I accept and it is part of the history given by him to Community Corrections, but particularly to psychologists, that his father became addicted to prohibited drugs himself when the offender was a teenager and was a man prone to violence. The offender’s relationship with his father is not particularly good. In fact, part of the evidence given by the offender as one of the reasons he returned to the use of methylamphetamine type substances was the then, in September, recent death of an uncle who had been like a father to him in the absence of his own father. The death of the uncle occurring in circumstances where the offender said for one reason or another he did not go to the hospital to see him before he passed away. The family continue to support him, as I understand, but again I point out his family have been supporting him no doubt through recent years and he has continued to offend.
	
	
	The offender has some employment history, particularly working in the family business as a “car detailer” but has been also on welfare benefits for part of the time that he has been at large in recent years. He described what is said to be an “entrenched history” of substance abuse issues. He commenced using heroin at the age of 17. He was on the methadone program for a period of time. For part of the time, whilst he was subject to supervision by Community Corrections back in the early part of the century, he left Australia without permission, not completing the orders to travel overseas. He claimed that he in fact at one point went to Lebanon to undertake some drug rehabilitation program. He disclosed to Community Corrections excessive amounts of Xanax abuse. He had a motorcycle accident in 2008 which has caused him a deal of distress, anxiety and caused some depressive symptoms. Apparently he was also hit by a car in 2012.
	
	
	He claimed he was under the influence of the drug “ice” at the time of the commission of the offence. He is said by Community Corrections to be an individual affected by unresolved drug related issues, which I accept, and this has continued into his current period of incarceration. He was forthcoming about his drug use and he displayed some insight into his offending behaviour, according to Community Corrections. However, his list of offences in custody mainly pertain to continued drug use and is of concern.
	
	
	His willingness to address his drug dependence issues may require admission to a residential rehabilitation centre and a comprehensive mental health assessment which has not really been undertaken by anybody. A psychologist’s report is not a “comprehensive mental health assessment”. He would benefit from the supervision of Community Corrections but a large number of matters would need to be addressed and that is why in determining the non-parole period, apart from making a finding of special circumstances for reasons I will outline later, it seems to me the Parole Authority should determine what the appropriate conditions of release are.
	
	
	A report was apparently prepared in May 2015 by a psychologist at the request of the solicitors for the offender. It seems to have been largely neglected in the course of submissions and seems to be overtaken by a more extensive report that was prepared by Dr Susan Pulman and another associate in the character of what was described as a “neuropsychological assessment”. I do not propose to dwell on the main report. Duffy Robilliard are respected psychologists but the truth of the matter is the report by Ms Allen only involved one psychometric test. That was the Millon Multiaxial Inventory III, which is a personality inventory that is self-reporting. Ultimately, the conclusion reached was that Mr Youssef’s profile was invalid as a result of a high score on the debasement scale. He also had a significant score on the scale measuring over disclosure. This result can indicate either a cry for help due to acute psychological distress or a fake bad profile, and the psychologist could not conclude one way or the other. With regard to the neuropsychological report he took into account Ms Allen’s report which set out his personal history, the detail of his upbringing, the problems that arose when his father became drug addicted when the offender was about 12.
	
	
	The offender is of parents of Lebanese origin but he himself was born in Sydney, although he has travelled back to Lebanon. He was in various relationships. He had an arranged marriage with a woman in Lebanon but that relationship did not last. He apparently has a fiancé who lives in Dubai. In fact he lived in Dubai himself for a period of time, which, in part, explains some gaps in his criminal history. The gap in his criminal history at one point over three or four years being a matter of some significance in the submissions of counsel for the offender.
	
	
	The offender denied any significant memory difficulties. He admitted though that he could be impatient and not pay attention at times. He gave details of his drug and alcohol use, which I have taken into account.
	
	
	The neuropsychologist had access to a number of reports - Ms Allen’s report, a psychosocial report from Ms Carolyn(?) Turner dated February 2013, which I assume was in some way connected with the earlier court proceedings. The neuropsychologist had access to Justice Health medical reports, medical records from St George Hospital confirming the offender’s admission for a period of time between 24 December 2008 to 2 January 2009 following a motorcycle accident and other injuries the offender has suffered at various times as a result of various trauma including being stabbed.
	
	
	The offender has been prescribed many medications including, one would have thought given his background, medications that would not be of great assistance to him, such as Oxycontin, sometimes referred to as “hillybilly heroin”.
	
	
	His criminal antecedents are discussed. The offender stated to the neuropsychologist that he was “determined to show the court and his family and partner that he could be a good person and that he would never touch drugs again and break the law.” The neuropsychologist undertook a number of tests, undertook a testing of what is called Premorbid Intellectual Functioning, Current Intellectual Functioning, Attention and Concentration/Information Processing, New Learning and Memory, Frontal and Executive/Adaptive Functioning, Motivation and Effort and Effective A Status. The conclusion reached by the neuropsychologist was that:
	


“As a result of the testing the offender’s full scale IQ is within the extremely low range. His verbal and non-verbal skills, working memory and processing speed are commensurate with his full scale IQ and within the borderline to extremely low ranges. His new learning and memory is significantly and unusually below expectation falling within the extremely low range. In addition, he demonstrates impairment in his visuospatial and visuoconstructional abilities. His executive functioning is variable with borderline to impaired reasoning, mental flexibility, planning and organisational skills. In contrast his verbal fluency is relatively intact. The results are considered a valid interpretation of his true level of current cognitive and intellectual function. He endorses symptoms suggestive of mild depression, moderate stress and extremely severe anxiety.”


	
	I note in the absence of any history or reliable history of mental illness, those symptons are probably more reactive to his situation and, of course, he has been on protection for some period of time, which I take into account.  
	
	
	The report goes on:
	


“In summary, his current intellectual functioning falls within the Borderline to Extremely Low range. His full scale IQ is within the mild intellectual disability range. However, a diagnosis of mild intellectual disability requires information and assessment of his level of adaptive functioning as well as support from corroborative sources such as school records, and these are not available, thus that diagnosis cannot be confirmed. In addition, Mr Youssef shows impairment in most cognitive domains with his new learning and memory deficits over and above that expected based on his intellectual functioning and hence cannot be solely due to his limited intelligence.”


	
	I query whether that is a subtle way of saying that he may not have performed up to expectations. His history, however, is suggestive of a head injury and he has a chronic history of substance abuse from a relatively young age, which is likely to have contributed to his current neuropsychological profile.
	
	
	With regard to his protestations of reform and the like and his empathy and sympathy for the victim, it is noted, as I have noted, his clinical presentations and comments are very similar to those reported in 2013 in relation to the earlier charges for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.
	
	
	The professional opinion of the reporter, Dr Pulman, is that although he appears genuinely regretful and remorseful for his actions, this is most likely a reaction to his situation and current stressors. His ability for consequential thinking is limited, consistent with the view of Ms Allen. It is the professional opinion of the neuropsychologist that without adequate intervention and addressing of drug issues and “maladaptive coping mechanisms”, the offender will be at continued risk of relapse and further offending. This is an assessment in its entirety with which I agree. He presents limited insight with regard to his offending behaviour and drug use and he does not possess the cognitive and intellectual skills to plan, organise, initiate and engage in seeking adequate help on his own. His plans for the future at times are tentative and unrealistic, for example - although he told me in his evidence that he wanted to get a driver’s licence, - he wants to work as a courier driver despite the fact that he has no driver’s licence. Whether he can even get a licence on his release is a matter of some debate.
	
	
	It is recommended that he have a ‘case manager’. He needs drug rehabilitation and he obviously needs to obtain gainful employment and seek other professional assistance. These matters I have taken into account in conjunction with the Community Corrections report to persuade me, as I have indicated, that I should make a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Act.
	
	
	It seems to me the offender needs an extended period of supervision to receive the relevant professional assistance, to receive the professional assessments that need to be undertaken and the enquiries that need to be undertaken.
	
	
	I also bear in mind, as a matter relevant to the finding ‘of special circumstances’, I am required to take into account that the sentence I impose is in fact partially accumulative upon the balance of parole that he was required to serve by the revocation of parole. That, of course, has to be factored into the calculation of the non-parole period.
	
	
	I have referred to the evidence of the offender in passing. The offender expressed remorse for the victim but he did, as the reporters in the psychological reports point out, tend to overstate the point. Then again, there are cultural issues at play, I understand that, although English is a language with which he is familiar but his primary language would be Arabic, some judgment of him needs to be reserved in his favour in the context of his particular cultural upbringing. I have already pointed out what he said to be the reason for his return to drugs.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor cross-examined him on a number of matters, suggested to him that he had forcefully tried to overstate his desire for reform and his desire to turn over a new leaf, and pressed the offender as to what had really changed for my judgment of the matter. It was put to him that he was not sorry for the victim, that he more sorry for himself. The offender denied that. I think it would be a perfectly natural thing for someone to say that they were sorry for a victim, but also inwardly feel sorry for themself in the sense that they know that they are facing a term of imprisonment.
	
	
	In relation to one aspect of the Crown’s cross-examination, I think the Crown unfortunately, and I do not criticise him, of course, he is a very very able and learned man, he suggested in cross-examination that the offender had in fact pleaded guilty on the basis of his knowledge that I would exclude his record of interview. The Crown, however, was acting upon misinformation that I had provided. I have already dealt with that matter. I am quite satisfied that I was quite wrong, and if I owe an apology to both counsel I certainly do so. I had other evidence in the matter but it was not of great significance. It did not take the offender’s evidence much further.
	
	
	I had extensive written submissions from counsel for the offender and very concise but to the point submissions from the learned Crown Prosecutor which I have taken into account. The offender’s counsel’s very excellent written submissions dealt with the background of the sentencing process and the history of the matter, reasons for the delay and the plea relating to the history of the representation and the difficulties in having a conference with the offender, which I have taken into account. Correctly counsel for the offender points to the purposes of sentencing pursuant to s 3A of the Act, and all, to varying extents, have a role to play here.
	
	
	There is a need for some level of general and personal deterrence. There is a need to adequately punish the offender and make him accountable and denounce his conduct but also promote his rehabilitation.
	
	
	There are a number of submissions made about the objective seriousness of the offending and those submissions deal with the matter in the context of the maximum penalty and the offender’s personal circumstances, the facts of the case and also relate the facts of the case to the guideline judgment of R v Henry and others, (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, to which I will refer later. The learned counsel for the offender went through the various matters that are said to be seen or occur in a “typical” armed robbery, such a creature maybe, and there are submissions about the character of the weapon and vulnerability of the victim, the intensity of the threat, the amount taken and the like.
	
	
	‘Aggravating factors’ are admitted to be the breach of conditional liberty, which is quite clearly so. Mitigating factors include the plea of guilty, for which the offender receives the discrete discount which I have calculated. It is also submitted as a mitigating factor that the offender is remorseful and I should find that in his favour. With regard to the issue of special circumstances, I have taken into account those submissions. I have already indicated my finding.
	
	
	The results of the neuropsychological report are the subject of particular submission in the context of the observations of the judgment of McClelland CJ at CL in 2010, in the decision DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 199. Particularly the principles that are summarised at [177]-[178]. I am familiar with these principles. It seems that every second judgment on sentence requires some reference to the matters that were summarised by the learned Chief Judge from various authorities dating back over 20 years, going back to cases like Scognamiglio, a decision of Grove J, through to Engert, the decision of Gleeson CJ in 1995, to cases like Israil, the judgment of Spigelman CJ, and, of course, the judgment which McClelland J’s judgment closely follows in this respect of Sperling J, in the decision of Hemsley (2004), a person who I had to sentence after that judgment and apply Hemsley principles. She was an inveterate armed robber with mental illness problems. Counsel has set out in summary the principles that were summarised themselves by the learned Chief Judge of the Common Law Division in De La Rosa, where the state of a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of an offence in a material way, a person’s moral culpability may be reduced. That may result in a reduction of sentence.
	
	
	It might mean that the person is not an appropriate vehicle for the full weight of general deterrence resulting in a reduction in a sense. It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence. It may also however, and it is not summarised in the written submissions of counsel, mean greater weight being given to personal deterrence as was explained by Gleeson CJ in Engert.
	
	
	There is not an automatic consequence that follows from a finding of a relevant mental disability or a mental illness. It all depends on the facts of the case. It also may be relevant to the circumstances of custody of a prisoner. Although here there is very little before me apart from the prisoner being on protection for reasons that have nothing at all to do with his intellectual functioning as I understand it. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that his circumstances of custody are made more difficult for that reason.
	
	
	I have taken into account the evidence in relation to the matter. I note counsel cited Gleeson CJ’s judgment in Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67, particularly, at 71. But the citing of the relevant passage does not include the point that I made a little earlier.
	
	
	What is cited from Engert is of course the observation of the learned Chief Justice that even if there is no causal connection between a mental disorder and the commission of the offence, the mental disorder may still be a very important matter in consideration of rehabilitation of the need for treatment outside the prison system. It seems to me based upon the neuropsychological reporting that there is no cure for the prisoner’s intellectual disability, such as it may be. It is a matter that he has to live with. But it is the case where he will need some assistance and it is submitted that the prisoner needs assistance in relation to substance abuse and rehabilitation.
	
	
	The criminal history of the prisoner is referred to in the submissions. Delay is referred to, particular by reference to the 1982 decision of Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517 and of course the decision of the High Court in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59, particularly at 66. I have also been favoured with submissions about the commencement of the sentence and general matters relating to facts of the case.
	
	
	The Crown’s written submissions are dealt in summary with the s 21A issues. So far as aggravating factors are concerned the Crown submits the criminal record is an aggravating factor and the breach of conditional liberty is an aggravating factor and that is an offence for financial gain, not necessarily an inherent characteristic of the offence.
	
	
	Firstly, I cannot conclude the prisoner’s criminal record is an “aggravating factor”. I have already summarised that he has no prior convictions for armed robbery, he has only previously before been gaoled once by the District Court - I am not saying that that means he has a good record, but having the experience of seeing many criminal histories from time-to-time in context I would regard his criminal history as one that does not entitle him to any particularly leniency, but certainly is not an aggravating factor.
	
	
	As understood arising under s 21A(2) I have dealt with the issue of conditional liberty. The financial gain issue I am not persuaded on. I appreciate it is not an inherent characteristic of the offence, but the truth of the matter is his financial gain was $100 which was recovered through the good work of the police.
	
	
	It seems to me, with the respect to the decision cited in the written submissions, that the whole purpose of conducting an armed robbery one would have though is to obtain property or money for one’s personal benefit; that is the general situation. In this particular matter I do not propose to find that as an aggravating factor.
	
	
	I did raise the issue of the vulnerability of the victim with both parties. The Crown did not submit that the victim was a vulnerable victim. The defence submitted that he was not. There is an element of vulnerability about the victim’s circumstances. He was a man driving a truck at 3am in the morning in Banksia. Ultimately I could not conclude that he was vulnerable. In fact I could not conclude he was picked on by any full appreciation of his characteristics.
	
	
	One of the aspects of vulnerability when it is considered in a factual context is that people will go to places and pick upon vulnerable victims because they know in advance that they vulnerable. That is why taxi drivers and service station consul operators are seen as vulnerable victims, despite the fact they are also mentioned in the legislation, because people commit crimes knowing that these people are working these types of jobs and are in some respects “easy prey”.
	
	
	There is no element of planning in this particular offence and as I have concluded that it was very opportunistic. I could not conclude that prior to the commission of the offence that this particular victim was followed or particularly approached other than in an opportunistic fashion without regard to whether he was vulnerable or not.
	
	
	I am taken to the guideline judgement of Henry, to which I will refer in a moment. I accept the Crown’s submissions that drug addiction is no excuse for armed robbery, nor is it a matter of mitigation. But the Crown did agree with my assessment of the matter that the offence appeared to have been opportunistic or impulsive.
	
	
	It is submitted by the Crown that the prisoner is not genuinely trying to desist from drug taking. I appreciate the prisoner, despite his statements to this effect, will have a great deal of difficulty given what happened in 2013. It is a matter that he has address otherwise he will just keep coming back to gaol over and over again.
	
	
	The Crown makes submissions about the low intelligence and the like and says that the prisoner is not at crossroads.
	
	
	One of the problems with the sentencing exercise arises from the delay; the prisoner was arrested over two years ago. When he did come before me in March 2015 the matter was delayed eight months before it came back to me. Not through any fault of mine, but simply because not enough funds could be obtained for him to get relevant scanning by MRI or CAT scan that might have assisted in identifying any brain injury from previous trauma to the head.
	
	
	I appreciate the prisoner is not responsible for that latter delay, nor are his legal representatives, nor the Crown. At the end of the day, if one was contemplating the issue of a person “being at the crossroads”, one would be looking at an offending for sentence sometime closer to the relevant commission of the offence than the position I am in now, where I am compelled ultimately to fix a non-parole period which will expire in the not too distant future.
	
	
	The Crown reflected upon the objective seriousness and put the submission to the Court that the offences were in a middle range of seriousness. I have taken all those submissions into account.
	
	
	I have also taken into account I hasten to say the schedule of cases taken from the Public Defenders’ data system dating back to the decision of Diamond in 1993 which I remember being a leading judgment from Justice Hunt on issues of parity of sentencing.
	
	
	There were many, many cases in this list, but primarily it was concerned with the post-Henry cases of which there are at least 40 or 50 listed. There are a range of sentences, some of the features are summarised, but it is not appropriate or possible for me to read all those relevant judgments from the Court of the Criminal Appeal. I have taken into account the range of sentences. I believe the sentence I am imposing fits within the general rubric or range reflected in the list.
	
	
	With regard to the Crown’s submission that the offence was in the middle range of objective seriousness, I note the defence would say that the offence was at the lower end of the scale. Of course it is conceded in the submissions of the prisoner that the offence is a serious offence; that goes without saying. The maximum sentence represents the seriousness of the offence and it is of course the case that the offence of armed robbery as it is shortly called has inherent characteristics which strike horror in the hearts of those who were victims and those who read about such offences.
	
	
	Of course, it is an offence that involves the use of a weapon to cause a person who has been assaulted by the use of an offence weapon to part with their property in order to have their property from them whilst it is either on their person or under their control.
	
	
	It is the essence of it and there are a range of offences of this type that can be committed, from the conduct of professional robberies at banks to muggings in the street. The guideline judgment in Henry to which I referred makes it very clear that, in its wider terms and by reference to the guidelines set out at [165] of the Chief Justice’s judgment, for a typical offence which in its profile might be categorised as an offence at the lower end of the scale of seriousness, the guideline is appropriate to be considered for an offender with favourable subjective circumstances, that is; relatively young, with little or no criminal record.
	
	
	This does not include any consideration of issues of moral culpability, mental illness, disability or parity in the oft cited ‘exceptional circumstances’ that might take the case outside the range of the guideline or take it to the lower side of the guideline. I bear in mind that the guideline, now 16 years old, is not a ‘tramline’. Of the guideline itself it was always said there was a residual discretion that existed, and the comments made by the Chief Justice at [10] citing Mahoney ACJ’s observations in the decision of Lattouf have to be borne in mind. The need for ‘individual justice’ is paramount in our system. It is to be noted that it was recognised in that judgment of the Chief Justice setting the guideline that an armed robbery may have circumstances of aggravation or ‘greater intensity’ as it was described. I refer particularly to [170], and also to [164] which must be read with the criteria for a ‘typical case’ in [162] of the judgment.
	
	
	There are aspects of sentencing in a general way, both arising from the decision of Markarian of the High Court in 2005 and in the judgment of Muldrock in 2011, although that is concerned primarily with standard non parole periods, that make it clear that there are many relevant matters to be taken into account in sentencing. All the matters that need to be taken into account are matters that are to be synthesised either instinctively or intuitively, except for perhaps permissible discrete discounts that may be given for pleas of guilty, recognising either the utilitarian benefit of a plea of guilty or the way in which prisoners facilitate the course of justice in Commonwealth matters, and also discounts for cooperation with investigating authorities.
	
	
	The judgment in Markarian reflects very much the disapproval of the type of mathematical precision that was attended to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in that judgment. The weight of various matters is usually incapable of precise mathematical calculation in any event. They should be identified but no mathematical analysis is required of the sentencing judge. In any event one does not have a computer that could, with complete precision, weigh up the various factors set out for example in the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Henry at [162]-[170].
	
	
	Having said that, those matters and many others relevant in particular sentencing exercises will also vary in significance and/or intensity. An example is the criminal history of an offender. A person may have a bad criminal history but no prior convictions for the offence for which they are to be sentenced. Here, this offender has no prior convictions for armed robbery although he has a finding of guilt for robbery in company as a juvenile.
	
	
	Another offender may have a lengthy criminal history of convictions for armed robbery when being sentenced for armed robbery. In those circumstances a criminal history more likely would be an aggravating factor under s 21A(2). As I said, here the criminal history does not entitle the offender to special leniency but it is not an aggravating factor. Another matter to take into account by reference to the guideline judgment and the relevant matters that arise from there, particularly in assessing the objective seriousness and the relevance of subjective matters, is that the guideline judgment pre-dates the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which did not become ‘law’ until the middle of 2001.
	
	
	Section 21A in its current form came into existence in 2002. Many of the matters now in s 21A(2) and (3) come not from Henry but from the judgment of Grove J and the guideline judgment in relation to break, enter and stealing delivered in 1999, reflecting the wisdom and skill of that judge.
	
	
	Accepting that this offence is a serious one, I conclude that it is at the lower end of objective seriousness but not at the lowest level. There are a number of reasons for this. First, there is the opportunistic character of it, there is almost no discernible planning, the character of the weapon used - it was a replica, it was a cigarette lighter. It was incapable of inflicting any harm unless used as a blunt instrument. The armed robbery in the case spoken of by the Chief Justice referred to an armed robbery with a weapon like a knife. A knife can cause great harm.
	
	
	A small amount of money was taken. The offender and the victim who, no doubt, was very scared, had a debate about what the offender could take. “You’re not taking my key card” said the victim, “you are not taking my wallet.” The offender took $100. There was no violence. There was a threat of violence by the presentation of the firearm, but the offender was happy to make do, it seems, with the $100 he took. While I do not accept that the offender was affected by drugs, he did know what he was doing, the offender seemed to be motivated to acquire some quick cash without causing too much damage to the victim.
	
	
	I also take into account that the money was recovered by the police. The offender’s involvement was relatively short, it took only a minute or so for the offence to be committed. The offender’s record I have taken into account. It reflects a degree of anti-social conduct but not of the same seriousness as one sees in other criminal histories. With regard to the aggravating factors under s 21A I have dealt with those. So far as the breach of conditional liberty is concerned, that is a serious matter in sentencing. It may come one day that people who breach their parole may never get paroled when they are next sentenced. At the moment I can still grant the offender parole and I do, and I can find special circumstances. There is no sunset clause on that.
	
	
	Having said that, listening to the offender’s evidence, there was no excuse for him to breach parole and the fact that his uncle died, even if it pressed him back into the use of methylamphetamine, is no excuse for committing armed robbery, or being in breach of parole. With regard to the relevance of his drug dependency, Henry is relevant, particularly the observations of Wood CJ at CL at [273]. There, his Honour dealt with the relevance of drug dependency, in an objective sense and in a subjective one. His Honour pointed out that a person with a drug habit or who obtains funds from an armed robbery to feed a ‘severe habit’ -which is not the case here - does not have an excuse to commit armed robbery and it is not a matter of mitigation.
	
	
	However, the fact that an offence is motivated by a need to obtain money to obtain drugs may be taken into account as a factor relevant to the objective criminality in assessing the impulsivity of the offence and the extent of any planning, which is the case here. In some cases the state of mind or capacity of the prisoner to exercise judgment, which I do not think arises here, having regard to the use of a weapon and the determination with which the prisoner obtained the cash, albeit a relatively small amount of money.
	
	
	I accept the prisoner had been using drugs at the relevant time. But I cannot conclude that he was so drug-affected as to not be able to exercise judgment or he did not know what he was doing. The video of his interview with the police demonstrated on his part an acuity or a nimbleness of thought to be able to deny his involvement in the offence and offer all sorts of alternative explanations for any connection that might have been had with the replica firearm, which by that time had been recovered. He told a number of untruths to the police, and it is clear from watching the video he had his eye on the crime, so to speak. He was endeavouring to persuade the police that he should not be charged with the armed robbery. I gave judgment as to the admissibility of that document, as I said, and I made a number of comments about his presentation during the interview.
	
	
	He had a very clear memory in the interview of his dealings with the police who arrested him which was entirely inconsistent with him being heavily affected by the drug at the relevant time. Of course, his lack of memory was a matter raised with me as explaining his late plea. As I have already indicated, I accept now that he did plead before my judgment on the admissibility of the record of interview, but in my view, even if he does have a lack of memory, which I doubt, I cannot see why the lack of memory of itself would have prevented him pleading guilty to the charge. In calculating the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, the fact is whatever the excuses are that are put before me - and I do not criticise the excuses I hasten to say - the prisoner pleaded after he was arraigned in this Court on the date the matter was fixed for trial. He pleaded ‘not guilty’ at that time. He pleaded guilty to the relevant charge three or four days later. I note of course that he pleaded guilty to an alternative charge.
	
	
	These are matters for negotiation, I appreciate that, but when one has regard to the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton one can see that by reference to the range of discount that is available, the only discount I could grant him in proper exercise of the discretion that is available to me to recognise the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty is a discount of 10%.
	
	
	The psychological assessments in my view show that the prisoner does not have any psychiatric illness, although he may be of low intellect. He does not have an intellectual disability that is proven to be of significance. I accept the fact that there is no evidence of psychosis at the time of the commission of the offence. His construction of events in the ERISP, or his reconstruction of events, clearly shows that that is the case. He has a low intellectual function, and I do not mean any disrespect to him but his performance during the interview with police shows him having a degree of cunning. As I have said, he has an awareness of relevant matters that enable him to speak up for himself when he wishes. Of course, his conduct when he was arrested, and his conduct in the preparation of the psychologist’s reports, and his conduct in custody reflects a degree of manipulation on his part which I thought was also evident in the giving of evidence.
	
	
	As far as I am concerned he sought to show himself in the most favourable light as to how he came to use drugs again, how he proposed to rehabilitate himself, to some extent the character of his remorse and how he was perceived by Correctional and Justice Health officers.
	
	
	The facts of the matter are the prisoner is no fool and it might be said that there is some reflection of that nominally in the testing conducted by the neuropsychologist. Be that as it may, and notwithstanding some equivocation in the report, it is the case that the testing does reveal a low intellect. I am prepared to accept that this has relevance in the assessment of the matter, as I have indicated. It is a matter that I should take into account in giving slightly less weight to the effect of general deterrence. But, in my view, I should give more weight to personal deterrence in the manner discussed by Chief Justice Gleeson in Engert. I believe his intellectual functioning does contribute, whether he is affected by drugs or not, to him acting impulsively without thinking out or organising what he is doing.
	
	
	It is a matter, in my view, also relevant to the assessment of his moral culpability, and I am prepared to give him some benefit in that regard, that is, reducing his moral culpability to some extent. But the reductions are ultimately to be slight in the context of understanding that, albeit that it was opportunistic, the conduct was calculated. His criminal history and his conduct in the past demonstrates his capacity for antisocial conduct notwithstanding the intellectual limitations that he has.
	
	
	I have taken into account his plans for the future, his relationship with his family, his love of his son. I am giving him some opportunity to look forward to release in a relatively short period of time. I am mindful of the difficulties of his upbringing. But all of these features have existed in the past. They existed before he was involved in this offence, they existed when he committed the offence, as I said earlier, that required him to serve a minimum period of 12 months, thus leading to him being on parole when he committed this offence.
	
	
	As to the matters personal to him that he says would lead him to the path of reform and his desire to give up drugs, those are matters to be taken into account. They cannot be ignored. But how genuine he is will be a matter to be proven in the future. Question marks about his genuineness, another reason ultimately to conclude that I should not make a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept that he has expressed remorse and I am prepared to identify it as a mitigating factor in this case. It and the plea of guilty are the only mitigating factors identified by his counsel pursuant to s 21A(3), and that clearly is so, but the weight to be given to it is slight. The timeliness of it is a relevant matter in assessing what weight to be given to it. Whilst the prisoner claims no memory, a claim I have considerable doubt about as I have said, it seems to me with respect that remorse, if it is to be a significant matter in sentencing, usually will be identified very early in the piece, sometimes immediately after an offence is committed. That is not the case here.
	
	
	In relation to the issue of delay, I have taken the delay in sentencing into account. I have made some comments about that. But this is not a case contemplated in Mill and Todd to which I earlier referred. Todd was a case of a man who committed crimes in New South Wales and Queensland, as my memory serves me. He crossed into Queensland committing crimes. He was arrested in Queensland. He spent a number of years in gaol in Queensland and he was released to be extradited back to New South Wales to be sentenced for offences he had committed many years before at the same time as the Queensland offences. He demonstrated whilst in custody a path to reform. That has not happened here. But in any event the circumstances of this matter and the period of time is nowhere near like the situation in Todd. I appreciate the delay has left the prisoner in some degree of uncertainty, but he has contributed in part to that delay. Then again of course, the unacceptable delay in coming forward for sentence is a matter over which he has had no control and it is something I regret, but it is certainly something for which I am not responsible.
	
	
	Ultimately I have concluded, doing my very best to instinctively synthesise all the relevant matters to be taken into account, that the starting point for any sentence for the prisoner should be five years imprisonment. He gets a discount of 10%, as I said. The total sentence will be four years and six months. It will date, as I said, from 24 January 2014 on the basis of the principles discussed in Callaghan from 2006, in the decision of Simpson J (now JA), trying to avoid the double-dipping that arises from taking into account a breach of parole as an aggravating factor. I have made a finding of special circumstances. Thus the sentence by way of non-parole period will be two years and six months. The prisoner will have a balance of sentence of two years. In my view, he needs an extended period of time to receive the professional assistance he needs. It will be a matter for the parole authority whether he is released or not.
	
	
	Mr Youssef, I am sorry to take so long. It is very boring to have to listen to all of this, but I must confess there is a lot of material here that I need to address. The matter was skilfully conducted by your counsel and the Crown. It would be an injustice to them not to deal with the particular matters that they raise.
	
	
	In respect of the armed robbery matter to which you pleaded guilty, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a non parole period of two years and six months. That sentence will start on 24 January 2014, it will expire on 23 July 2016. The balance of sentence of two years will expire on 23 July 2018. You will be eligible for release to parole on 23 July 2016. It will be a matter for the Parole Authority as to what your conditions of parole are and will fix them. It will be a matter for the Parole Authority as to whether you are released. So it will be a matter for you to impress the Parole Authority that you should be released on that date.
	
	
	I have taken into account, as I have said, all your evidence. I am mindful of your re-engagement with your religion and I hope that when you return to the community you will find within your community people that will be able to assist you to avoid using drugs and to avoid offending in the future.
	
	
	Madam Crown, anything else from you?
	
	
	WOOD: No thank you, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Anything else from you, sir?
	
	
	ROBINSON: Thank you, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Do you understand the sentence, Mr Youssef? The non parole period ends in July 2016, 23 July 2016, and it will be a matter for the parole authority whether you are released on that date. If you are released on that date you will be on parole for two years. The sentence has been backdated to January 2014. Thank you very much, Mr Youssef, thank you very much for being with us through the closed-circuit television. I’m sorry about the delay in connecting to you. Your solicitor will be in touch with you I hope to explain the sentence to you.
	
	
	ROBINSON: I’ll endeavour to do that straight away but I fear that the timing may - but I’ll make a call as soon as I can.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You may not be able to do it by close of business, but I think he understands of course the non-parole period finishes in July.
	
	
	ROBINSON: Thank you, your Honour, I appreciate you explaining that.

		21 April 2016",2015-12-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768365,Gaynor v Burns (No. 2) [2015] NSWDC 283,"Judgment


	
	This is an application pursuant to rr 14.28 and 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”) challenging the form and capacity of the imputations. Due to availability problems for counsel for the parties, it has been determined on the basis of written submissions.

	The plaintiff was investigated by the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board for vilifying homosexuals because he allowed to be published on his blog the words ‘exterminate all homos’.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a pernicious boofhead. [Note: the plaintiff has now amended this imputation to read: “the plaintiff is a pernicious boofhead in that he is a dangerous and harmful fool”.
	
	
	The plaintiff permitted excerpts from the verse of St. Paul calling for homosexuals to be put to death on his blog.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a pernicious imbecile. [Note: this imputation has now been withdrawn.]
	



	
	The imputations pleaded in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim are as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff claims that homosexuals are depraved criminals.
	
	
	The plaintiff vilified homosexuals on his facebook page when he commented upon the remarks of Judge Garry Neilson during a criminal trial.

	The plaintiff believes that being homosexual is a criminal offence.
	
	
	The plaintiff believes that being homosexual is a psychiatric perversion requiring jailing.
	
	
	The plaintiff was sacked form the Australian Defence Force for his harsh and intolerant public treatment toward homosexual Australians.
	
	
	The plaintiff was sacked as a candidate for the Katter Australia Party for his harsh and intolerant public treatment toward homosexual Australians.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a hate mongering pernicious grub.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a NAZI [sic].
	


The issues before the court


	
	The issues before the court have changed as a result of amendments to the imputations pleaded. The issues now are:
	



	
	Whether the plaintiff should be granted leave to replead imputation 3(d);
	
	
	A ruling on the revised imputation 3(d);
	
	
	A ruling as to whether imputations 3(a) and 3(c) differ in substance;
	
	
	A ruling as to whether imputation 3(e) is defamatory;
	
	
	A ruling as to the capacity of imputations 5(b) and 5(e);
	
	
	Costs of the argument
	


The history of this dispute


	
	The plaintiff commenced proceedings by way of Summons to identify the defendant. A statement of claim was filed on 23 April 2015 and the defendant, who was then representing himself, filed defences on 15 and 29 May 2015 and 25 September 2015.
	
	
	The defendant challenged the imputations only after the most recent defence was filed. His counsel provided a list of the following objections to the statement of claim:
	



	
	Imputations 3(a) and 3(c) are not materially different;
	
	
	Imputations 3(d) and 3(f) are not defamatory, being mere vulgar abuse, and do not differ in substance;
	
	
	Imputation 3(e) is not defamatory; and
	
	
	Imputations 5(a), 5(b), 5(e) and 5(i) are incapable of being conveyed.
	



	
	By email dated 29 September 2015, the defendant revised his objections to the imputations as follows:
	



	
	Imputations 3(d) and 3(f), as well as being not defamatory by reason of being mere vulgar abuse, are also not materially different in substance.
	
	
	The objection to imputation 5(a) is no longer pressed.
	
	
	The objection to imputation 5(i) is no longer pressed.
	



	
	This history is relevant to the first submission of the defendant, namely that leave to amend imputation 3(d) should not be granted by reason of the case management principles to defamation litigation as set out in Dennis v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2008] NSWCA 37 at [30]-[31]. The submissions in support complain of the failure to seek leave to amend and to file an amended statement of claim, which is asserted to be a prerequisite to such applications (s 64 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW); r 19.5 UCPR). Alternatively or additionally, a special costs order should be made in relation to the costs of this amendment.
	
	
	Neither side has conducted these proceedings in full compliance with the rules. The defendant filed three defences before objecting to the form and capacity of the imputations. It is common for there to be amendments to imputations made “on the run” in the course of form and capacity arguments. It is not necessary to go through the formality of filing an amended pleading each time that this occurs. Taking all these factors into account, I do not propose to refuse leave to amend, or to make any special costs order in relation to this amendment, although I have taken it into account as a factor relevant to the costs order I have made for the costs of this argument.
	
	
	The defendant’s alternative grounds of objection are that the amended imputation still does not address the plaintiff’s complaints as to form, and additionally that the imputation pleaded (and the portions of the matter complained of giving rise to it) still amount only to “vulgar abuse”; the publication is therefore not capable of conveying any meaning, let alone a defamatory meaning.
	


Imputation 3(d) and vulgar abuse


	
	Language which is abusive may still be defamatory (Bennette v Cohen (2005) 64 NSWLR 81 at [98]). However, if what is conveyed is in such general derogative terms that no defamatory act or condition is capable of being distilled, the statement may be mere vulgar abuse: Mundey v Askin [1982] 2 NSWLR 369 at 371-372 (“Mundey”).
	
	
	Whether statements in a publication amount to mere vulgar abuse depends upon a careful analysis of the matter complained of, rather than upon legal principles. In “Defamation Law” (Lawbook Co., Thomson Reuters, 2016, pp. 109-110), Dr David Rolph explains:
	


“However, “vulgar abuse” is not a term of art. It is important not to overstate the distinction between mere vulgar abuse on the one hand and defamation on the other. The fundamental question should remain whether the matter in question was capable of conveying an imputation which disparaged the plaintiff’s reputation, rather than whether the defendant’s conduct amounted to mere vulgar abuse.”


	
	Claims of “vulgar abuse” were so rare that Mundey, the leading case on this issue, remained unreported for some years after it was handed down. Its increase in popularity in recent times owes much to the colourful and intemperate language that is the hallmark of Internet blogs and social media, as more than one judge has observed. In Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd & Ors v Hargreaves [2007] EWHC 2375 (QB), Justice Richard Parkes QC described one such publication as “saloon bar moanings” (at [17]), while in Clift v Clarke [2011] EWHC 1164 (QB) the description (at [36]) was ""pub talk"".
	
	
	In Polias v Ryall [2013] NSWSC 1267, where the matters complained of were a series of social media posts of this kind, McCallum J explained the application of the principles discussed in Mundey as follows:
	


“[11] …Sir Robert Askin was Premier of New South Wales and a member of the Liberal Party. When the Party opened its campaign in the general election which took place later that year, Sir Askin made a speech which included the following remarks (at 370B):

The “real masters” of the Labor Party are Messrs Hawke, Mundey, Carmichael, Halfpenny and Crawford and all the rest of the left-wingers with a good sprinkling of commos. Fancy leaving the running of Australia — even if they do it behind the scenes — to that happy bunch.

But don’t under-estimate some of these vermin.

Mr Mundey is the trade union official who is generally credited with having pressured Mr Whitlam into putting into his policy speech last Monday an undertaking to remove the penal clause from the Arbitration Act.

Is this the kind of person you want having a say in the running of Australia?

Because, make no mistake, it is abundantly clear that these are the kind of people who would be standing at the elbow of any Labor prime minister prompting and urging and threatening industrial turmoil and violence unless their demands were granted.

Don’t let the public say they haven’t had a full warning of the dangers of electing a Labor Government. It might seem innocuous on the surface, but it would be a prisoner and obey the dictates of the extreme left-wing.

[12] Mundey sued.

[13] At trial, the judge directed the jury that, if they thought any of the words complained of amounted to no more than vulgar abuse, it was open to them to take the view that the words were not defamatory of Mr Mundey. The jury evidently acceded to that proposition, expressly finding that the words were not defamatory. The plaintiff’s appeal against the verdict was dismissed. The Court of Appeal held that there was no error in his Honour’s direction to the jury that words might be abusive, vulgar or objectionable without being defamatory. The court specifically endorsed the trial judge’s remark that such words “might injure a man’s pride without injuring his reputation” (at 372C).

[14] It must be recalled that Mr Mundey’s action went to trial. On a preliminary capacity objection, the characterisation of words sued on in a defamation action as being “mere vulgar abuse” cannot supplant the test as to whether the matter complained of is capable of conveying the imputation in question. As noted in Bennette v Cohen, there is not a dichotomy between vulgar abuse and matter which is defamatory: [2005] NSWCA 341; (2005) 64 NSWLR 81 at [51] per Bryson JA; Beazley JA and Brownie A-JA agreeing at [1] and [60] respectively. Ultimately, the question is whether the jury could reasonably understand the matter complained of in the defamatory sense contended for: Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 52.

[15] Conversely, it does not follow that a capacity argument could never succeed in such a case. There will be instances in which the position is clear enough to conclude that abusive words are incapable of conveying any defamatory meaning. The Frenchman’s taunt in the well-known Monty Python film may afford an example (“your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries”).”


	
	The matter complained of purports to describe proceedings commenced against the plaintiff by the defendant in the Anti-Discrimination Board after publication by “this pernicious boofhead Bernard Gaynor” of statements which condone “the killing of homosexuals” by calling for their extermination on his blog (paragraph 7). It goes on to complain that “this pernicious imbecile thinks it’s perfectly okay” to call for homosexuals to be “exterminated” (paragraph 14).
	
	
	Although conveyed in disparaging terms, an imputation (of condition) is capable of arising to the effect that the plaintiff is not merely stupid, but dangerously stupid, for advocating the mass extermination of homosexuals. In other words, the matter complained of does not merely abuse the plaintiff, but makes a statement capable of being disparaging to the plaintiff’s reputation.
	
	
	The vice in the imputation as currently pleaded is that the plaintiff has merely repeated the words of the matter complained of and added some extra words to explain what the sting of the meaning is, in a rolled-up form.
	
	
	While a plaintiff may use the words in the matter complained of, that is permissible where those words capture the sting. Adding extra words to explain it (especially where more than one concept is added, by use of the word “and”) is no substitute for capturing the meaning in a clear and simply worded imputation.
	
	
	The words added do not, in any event, convey the sting of the plaintiff behaving in a “pernicious” way. Ms Wass SC points out that the Macquarie Dictionary defines “pernicious” as “ruinous; “highly hurtful”; “deadly”; “fatal”; “evil”; or “wicked”. I note that Wiktionary defines “pernicious” as meaning “causing death or injury”.
	
	
	Imputation 3(d) is struck out with leave to replead. Great care will need to be exercised to ensure that the repleaded imputation differs in substance from the other pleaded imputations.
	


Imputations 3(a) and 3(c)


	
	Imputation 3(a) refers to the plaintiff vilifying homosexuals on his blog, whereas imputation 3(c) sets out that the plaintiff was investigated by the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board for this conduct.
	
	
	It is not submitted that to be investigated for such conduct is not capable of defamatory meaning (to say of any person that they are reasonably suspected, let alone under investigation, by an organisation of this nature is capable of being defamatory: Sergi v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1982] 2 NSWLR 669 at 671 per Hutley JA). What is asserted is that being investigated for the conduct, rather than committing the conduct, is not capable of differing in substance.
	
	
	The difference in meaning is immediately apparent when considering the evidence which would be necessary to justify the meanings. The evidence necessary for imputation 3(a) would be the tender of the blogs referred to, while the evidence for imputation 3(c) would be the tender of documents demonstrating that the plaintiff was in fact investigated by this body. The defendant’s objection therefore fails.
	
	
	Imputations 3(a) and 3(c) accordingly differ in substance.
	


Imputation 3(e) and defamatory meaning


	
	Ms Wass SC submits that an imputation to the effect that the plaintiff published verses from the Bible calling for homosexuals to be put to death is not capable of being defamatory, for much the same reason as saying someone is seriously ill is not defamatory (Grappelli v Derek Block (Holdings) Ltd [1981] 1 WLR 822).
	
	
	There may be cases where it is not defamatory to say of someone that they are a killer or have killed someone. It all depends on the context. In Greek Herald Pty Ltd v Nikolopoulos (2001) 54 NSWLR 165 Young CJ in Eq observed:
	


“[54] There was discussion before us as to whether some ordinarily offensive terms could be said to be innocuous. Thus, words like ""get away you old bastard"" may well not be defamatory and to call someone a killer may be even laudatory of a boxer. Even to call a police officer ""killer"" may merely mean the officer has a singleness of purpose in cleaning up crime. However, all these are really fanciful examples and had little to do with the instant case. There is a theoretical problem that if the jury do not see the context, counsel will in future cases put fanciful submissions like this. I do not believe this is a serious problem if the imputations are precisely pleaded or the problems are identified early on in the case.

[55] I should note that in Attorney-General of Ontario v Dieleman (1994) 117 DLR (4th) 449, 670-671 Adams J held that a sign ""Dr X kills unborn babies"" was not defamatory.”


	
	However, to say of any person that he or she has called for any group of persons to be put to death in the context of a publication of the present kind is clearly capable of conveying a defamatory meaning. Defamatory meanings are determined by considering the matter complained of and not merely the language of the imputation (Greek Herald Pty Ltd v Nikolopoulos). The language of the portions of the matter complained of giving rise to this imputation is neither merely insulting nor written in a joking fashion. Nor does the reference to St Paul render the imputation’s meaning anodyne.
	
	
	Additionally, these issues are matters best left to the tribunal of fact, and determination of defamatory meaning should only be dealt with summarily in very clear cases: Bik v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1979] 2 NSWLR 679n.
	
	
	The defendant’s application to strike out imputation 3(e) is dismissed.
	


Imputations 5(b) and 5(e)


	
	The objection to these imputations is put on the basis of capacity. The approach to a challenge to capacity of the matter complained of to convey imputations has been explained by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227 at [134]-[138] as follows:
	


“[134] That standard by which the issue of law raised by the separate trial was to be determined was addressed in Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 52; (2005) 79 ALJR 1716 (“Favell“) where the plurality (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Heydon JJ, Kirby J generally agreeing) approved the following statement by McPherson JA in the Court of Appeal:

Whether or not [the pleading] ought to and will be struck out [as disclosing no cause of action] is ultimately a matter for the discretion of the judge who hears the application. Such a step is not to be undertaken lightly but only, it has been said, with great caution. In the end, however, it depends on the degree of assurance with which the requisite conclusion is or can be arrived at. The fact that reasonable minds may possibly differ about whether or not the material is capable of a defamatory meaning is a strong, perhaps an insuperable, reason for not exercising the discretion to strike out. But once the conclusion is firmly reached, there is no justification for delaying or avoiding that step [at] whatever stage it falls to be taken.”


	
	I first note the nature of the two challenged imputations. Imputation 5(b) is an “act” imputation (namely the publication of vilification of homosexuals), while imputation 5(e) is an imputation of “condition” (namely that the plaintiff hold certain beliefs).
	
	
	Ms Wass SC submits, as to imputation 5(b), that the ordinary reasonable reader would have understood the “comments” that are quoted in the post were apparently made by others, and not by the plaintiff. The imputation would be that the plaintiff allows the statements of others (not the plaintiff) on his Facebook wall, which statements encourage the view that homosexuality is a psychiatric perversion for which jail is the only answer. The matter complained of is thus not capable of conveying an imputation that the plaintiff actually published these remarks.
	
	
	The matter complained of is in sensational, tabloid style, where the ordinary reasonable reader would be likely to engage in loose thinking: Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158. Applying the test for capacity set out in Corby (see above), this imputation is capable of being conveyed.
	
	
	For the same reasons, and applying the same principles of “generosity not parsimony” (Corby at [135]), imputation 5(e) is similarly capable of being conveyed.
	


Costs


	
	While it might appear that the plaintiff has succeeded more often than the defendant, this is as the result of abandonment or amendment of some of the plaintiff’s unsuccessful pleadings, in circumstances where those changes occurred very late in the day. The appropriate order is that each party pay his own costs.
	


Orders


	
	Imputation 3(d) is struck out with leave to replead.
	
	
	Defendant’s objections to imputations 3(a) and 3(c) dismissed.
	
	
	Imputations 5(b) and 5(e) are capable of being conveyed and will go to the jury.
	
	
	Each party pay his own costs.

		03 December 2015",2015-12-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768370,R v Anthony Mark James [2015] NSWSC 1831,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The accused, Anthony Mark James, is on trial before me, sitting without a jury, upon an indictment charging the manslaughter of a man named in the indictment as Dana Lomas at Doonside on 26 May 2011. It is alleged that the accused killed the deceased by a single stab wound in the course of a violent confrontation between the two men at the townhouse where they were living at the time.
	
	
	The accused is alleged to have committed manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. There is no issue that he inflicted the fatal wound and that that act was dangerous but, in any event, there is ample evidence to satisfy me of both those things beyond reasonable doubt. The issue is self-defence. To adopt the language of s 418 of the Crimes Act 1900, it is the accused’s case that he stabbed the deceased because he believed that it was necessary to do so to defend himself, and that his conduct was a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them. Of course, he does not bear the burden of proving either of those things. He is entitled to be acquitted unless the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not believe that his conduct was necessary to defend himself, or that it was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them.
	
	
	Most of the evidence is undisputed, and the primary focus of these reasons is upon the fatal event. There is evidence by way of background, particularly directed to the relationship between the two men, which can be summarised briefly. This is a re-trial, following a successful appeal against conviction in an earlier trial, and a significant proportion of the evidence has been presented through transcripts of evidence given in the previous trial. The accused did not give evidence before me. That, of course, was his right and gives rise to no adverse inference against him.
	


Background


	
	The first name of the deceased in the indictment is shown as Dana, but he was better known as Dale and was referred to in the evidence by that name. It appears that he was homosexual, and from time to time used female names. He and the accused had been living together at the townhouse since May 2010, although the deceased had been living there for some time prior to that. It is apparent from the evidence of members of the deceased’s family and of neighbours in the area that the relationship between the two men was volatile. They would regularly have arguments, with raised voices. One of their neighbours, Mr Alan Jones, described their relationship as not “very good.” Mr Jones’ brother, Robert, who lived with him, said that they were “always at each other.”
	
	
	On occasions the deceased complained to members of his family of aggressive behaviour towards him by the accused. Late in 2010, he told his sister, Bella Winikerei, that the accused had hit him, causing scratches and bruising on his chest and back, which she saw. In March 2011, he had been at a party with his sister, Bella and another sister, Gloria Anderson, at the home of his niece, Eileen Winikerei. Late in the evening he left for a period and returned to his townhouse. He came back to the party, visibly distressed, and told his sisters and his niece that the accused had chased him out of the house. According to Bella Winikerei, he said that the accused had chased him out of the house with a knife.
	
	
	There was eye-witness evidence of another occasion on which the accused inflicted violence on the deceased. On 20 May 2011, another neighbour, Ms Sandra Crawford, saw an altercation between the two men outside the townhouse. They were arguing and the accused swung a piece of wood, which Ms Crawford described as a “bed slat,” towards the deceased’s back three times, missing him the first time but striking him twice. The deceased ran in to the townhouse, and emerged with what Ms Crawford described as a “pole” in his hand and chased the accused down the street.
	
	
	On the other hand, there were eye-witness accounts of occasions on which the deceased behaved violently or aggressively towards the accused. Some time in May 2011, Alan and Robert Jones and another neighbour, Peter Rofe, saw an incident while the accused was working on his car. The deceased approached him and verbally abused him. According to Mr Rofe, the accused told him to calm down and the deceased became very agitated and threw what Mr Rofe described as a stick from a tree at the accused three times. Robert Jones also described a big stick from a tree, and Alan Jones described it as a “hunk of timber.” Whatever the object was, it did not strike the accused.
	
	
	In the afternoon of 24 May 2011, two days before the fatal incident, Ms Julie Pardey, her son, Blake Pardey, and her daughter, Kirralee Howley, were travelling in a car in the street where the deceased and accused lived. They saw an incident involving two men whom they did not know, but it is accepted that they were the deceased and the accused. The deceased was chasing the accused, brandishing what Ms Pardey described as a machete and her son and daughter described as a samurai sword. Ms Pardey described the accused as “running for his life.” The two men ran out of their sight.
	
	
	In the period leading up to his death the deceased abused illicit drugs, and Ms Anderson noticed that he was losing weight and not looking after himself.
	


The events of 26 May 2011


	
	Around the middle of the day on 26 May 2011, the day of his death, the deceased injected himself with methylamphetamine and smoked cannabis at the townhouse in the company of a longstanding acquaintance, Michael McCluskey. In Mr McCluskey’s presence, the accused and deceased were arguing. The deceased complained that the accused was not paying his way and demanded that he pack his belongings and leave. The accused was still there when Mr McCluskey left in the early afternoon.
	
	
	It appears that the deceased then went to visit Ms Crawford, to whom he was close, and was there until sometime after 5pm. She described him as “a bit stressy” and upset, because he had told the accused that he had to leave that day. Between 5.30 and 6pm another neighbour, Raylene Gregg, saw two men in the front yard of the deceased’s townhouse having a heated conversation. Their voices were raised but she could not hear what they were saying. She did not know the men but, again, it is accepted that they were the deceased and the accused.
	
	
	In the afternoon of 26 May, Mr Stavan Bora was in the area to visit residents and discuss their gas and electricity expenses on behalf of the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL). At about 5.15pm he went to the deceased’s home and spent some time with him in conversation about the matter. Asked by Mr Bora to produce some identification, he provided a key card in the name of Stacey Wells. During this encounter two calls were made to AGL, the second of them timed by call charge records at 5.57pm. Mr Bora left very shortly thereafter but, before he did, the deceased asked him for a cigarette and, as he put it, came very close to his face and made him feel “a bit uncomfortable.”
	
	
	For some years the accused had been assisted by the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) in the Blacktown area, conducted by Pastor Eddy Johnson. Through his contact with that counselling service he had met Matthew Holmes. Mr Holmes rang the accused in the early evening of 26 May and the accused sounded very distressed when he answered the phone. He said words to the effect of “I’ve done something” and “What have I done?” He asked Mr Holmes to ring Pastor Johnson. Mr Holmes said that he would do so and that he would go over to see the accused, urging him to keep calm and not do anything to harm himself. Call charge records reveal that this call was made at 6.08pm. Plainly enough, the fatal incident occurred sometime between the 5.57pm call to AGL and this call.
	
	
	Mr Holmes told his mother that the accused had been “talking about necking himself” and was very depressed. The two of them travelled to the townhouse. The accused was not there, but Mr Holmes entered and saw the body of the deceased. A little later he saw the accused approaching him in the street. The accused said that Pastor Johnson was on his way. They did not discuss what had occurred and Mr Holmes and his mother left.
	
	
	In the meantime the accused had gone to the home of Alan and Robert Jones. According to Mr Jones, he was shaking and he started crying. He said, “I’ve hurt Dale.” Asked what he had done, he said that he had done something bad to Dale. Mr Jones said, “How bad is he?” The accused replied, “Bad.” The accused wanted Mr Jones to contact Pastor Johnson, but he made contact with the Pastor himself. Mr Jones apparently took him to mean that he had killed the deceased, and he rang 000 to report the matter. The accused had a towel wrapped around his left arm, and he pulled it back to show what Mr Jones described as “a really nasty cut.”
	
	
	Pastor Eddy Johnson gave evidence that the accused had visited him in the morning of 26 May, when he appeared normal and friendly. However, at about 7.15pm he received a call from him on his mobile. He was sobbing and incoherent. Pastor Johnson asked him to calm down. The accused said, “Please come, please come, I need you, Pastor Eddy.” Pastor Johnson ascertained that he was at Alan Jones’ place, and he set off to see him in the company of two members of his support group.
	
	
	When they arrived in the vicinity, the accused approached them. Pastor Johnson said that he was still to some extent incoherent. When he asked what had happened, the accused said, “I want to die, give me a rope.” Pressed as to what had happened, he said, “He came at me with a knife and slashed my arm, so I let go, I think … . I want to die, I want to die.” The Pastor could see the towel wrapped around his left arm and the wound. The accused said, “I stabbed him, I stabbed him. Somehow I got the knife away from him and I took the knife and then I stabbed him.” He also said words to the effect that there was grappling or struggling and he “stopped” the deceased.
	
	
	Pastor Johnson said that it would be necessary to call the police. He and his companions accompanied the accused to Mr Jones’ home, where the accused sat on a bed with his head between his hands, sobbing.
	
	
	At about 8.40pm Senior Constable Michelotti arrived, accompanied by Acting Sergeant Cook. Senior Constable Michelotti spoke to the accused, but found him difficult to understand because he was crying and mumbling. However, the accused did say, “I’ve stabbed my friend. I think I killed him.” The officer asked him to stop crying and tell him again what had happened, and the accused said, “I had a fight with my friend. I was defending myself and I stabbed him.” Senior Constable Michelotti then went to the townhouse, accompanied by Pastor Johnson, where he found the deceased lying on a lounge in a corner of the lounge room. Ambulance officers arrived, and confirmed that he was dead.
	
	
	At 9.10pm the accused was interviewed in the street outside the townhouse by Detective Sergeant Bristow, and an audio recording was made of the interview. That recording came into evidence as exhibit D. It is apparent that the accused was still distressed, and at times he was crying. He maintained his account that the deceased was the original aggressor with the knife, that he disarmed him and that he stabbed him, as he saw it, in self-defence.
	
	
	He told Detective Bristow that the deceased was “going off his head” because he, the accused, was packing up to leave. He said that he wanted to move out because the deceased had been making homosexual advances towards him. Early in the interview, he said that the deceased had the knife and slashed him a couple of times to his arms. He said that didn’t really want to fight, that “after a couple of times” he just didn’t know what to do, and he just stabbed him (Qs 13-17). He said that he stabbed the deceased “just once” (Q 29), after the deceased had slashed him “about three or four times” (Q 34). A little later he said:
	


“… Dale was going off his head and slashed me a couple of times and I took a couple of, like I took a couple of slashes because I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know whether to respond or just to take it. … And then after a couple of times I seen this one was really open. … I thought it was a bit too dangerous to be just copping it. … So I grabbed it and stabbed him.” (Qs 51-54)


	
	Asked how he stabbed the deceased, he demonstrated a sideways motion with his right hand (Qs 84-88). Asked what he was trying to do by that action, he said that he “really didn’t have any intentions to do anything,” that it was “reflex really,” and that he was scared and confused (Qs 89-91). Again asked what he was trying to do with the knife, he said, “Just protect meself” (Q 94).
	
	
	The effect of what he said and demonstrated was that he stabbed the deceased in the left hand side of his body as he was facing him. Asked what he was trying to do by “trying to get him with the knife,” he said:
	


“I was just trying to swing it around and like just scare him back. But I think he stepped in or something. He was just going wild, mate. I don’t really know what happened, mate. It just went so quick. …”

(Qs 97-103)


	
	There was then the following exchange:
	


“Q113   … What were you intending to do by trying to get him with the knife?

A   Keeping a distance, get him away. You know what I mean? Like - - -

Q114   Were you trying to injure him?

A   No way, man.

Q115   Well if you weren’t why would you do that?

A   I was just trying to like swing it in front of him.

Q116   Yep.

A   But he’s gone like that.

Q117   Yep.

A   Like grabbing - - -

Q118   You’re sort of indicating that he, that he sort of jumped at you with his arms up?   

A   Yeah, he just went like that. And I went … And I just went to swing it like that.

Q119   Yep.

A   And I think I got him in here somewhere.

Q120   So it’s gone into his side under his left arm has it?

A   (NO AUDIBLE REPLY)

Q121   That’s what you’re sort of indicating to me.

A   Yeah”.


	
	Asked how hard he stabbed the deceased, he said that it didn’t feel hard (Qs 124-125). He said that prior to the incident the deceased had had people at the townhouse “taking drugs and stuff,” although it is unclear at what stage of the day this was said to have happened (Q 65). He later said that the deceased “goes right off his head when he is on pills and shit” (Q 105).
	
	
	He denied that it was his intention to kill the deceased or, indeed, to injure him (Qs 126-128). He tearfully expressed his remorse, saying “I’m so sorry, man. I’m just fucken so sorry. … please forgive me, man. I’m so sorry” (Qs 146-147).
	
	
	The accused was taken to Blacktown Hospital, where he was seen in the Emergency Department by a registered nurse, Jacqueline Borsato. Ms Borsato saw three cuts to his right forearm and a wound to his left forearm. She also observed what appeared to be recent red marks on his left eye and his cheek and scratch marks on his chest. He was treated by Dr Farooq, who sutured the cuts to his forearms. Dr Farooq reported that the laceration to the left forearm involved the fat layer inside the skin, but there was no muscle injury.
	
	
	Photographs of the accused’s forearms are part of exhibit E. The wound to the left forearm looks large and deep. Photographs of the red marks on the accused’s face are part of exhibit W.
	


The expert evidence


	
	A post-mortem examination of the deceased was conducted by Dr Riane Van Vuuren in the morning of 28 May 2011. I received the transcript of her evidence in the previous trial. She found the cause of death to be a stab wound to the posterior lateral aspect of the chest, that is, on the left hand side towards the back and under the arm. The wound was 24cm deep, and had penetrated the left lung and the heart. Her opinion was that it probably needed moderate to severe force to inflict the wound.
	
	
	Dr Van Vuuren noted superficial injuries to the deceased’s left hand, consistent with defence injuries. She also noted that the hyoid bone, which is in the neck, had been fractured. There was a small bruise associated with the fracture, and two abrasions on the right side of the neck and two small incisions on the right lateral aspect of the chin. She was of the view that the fracture of the hyoid bone and these other injuries were occasioned at the same time as the stab wound.
	
	
	She said that a fracture of the hyoid bone is normally the result of manual strangulation. However, in cross-examination by counsel then appearing for the accused, she agreed that it was possible that the fracture and at least some of the injuries on the right side of the neck and jaw were caused by the accused seizing and squeezing the deceased’s neck or the area between the shoulder and the neck. The scenario was put to her of the accused grabbing the deceased in the neck area with his left hand, while holding the knife in his right hand, in a “defensive action,” and she could not rule out the possibility that the injury to the hyoid bone was caused in that way.
	
	
	Also in cross-examination, Dr Van Vuuren agreed that the stab wound was horizontal, consistent with the knife having been held in that plane when it was inflicted. Counsel demonstrated a movement whereby the knife was turned on its side and swung in a sideways action, and the doctor agreed that that would be consistent with the wound. Counsel then took her to the accused’s account in the recorded interview at Qs 113-121, quoted above, the effect of which was that while the accused was swinging the knife in front of the deceased, the deceased jumped towards him with his arms up and the accused, by a sideways swinging action, caused the knife to penetrate his side under the left arm. The doctor agreed that that was a possible scenario.
	
	
	I also received a transcript from the previous trial of the evidence of Dr Judith Perl, the well-known forensic pharmacologist, who was supplied with a blood sample taken from the deceased. She found that the blood contained 0.3 mgs per litre of amphetamine and 0.24 mgs per litre of methylamphetamine. Also present was delta-9-THC acid, consistent with the deceased having used cannabis. She described the concentration of methylamphetamine as within the toxic range, that is, a level at which one would expect to see adverse effects upon an individual. Those effects, however, would vary depending upon the degree of tolerance that person had developed to the drug. She found that the methylamphetamine had been partly metabolised, which means that it would have been ingested at least 2 to 4 hours before death.
	
	
	She described the effects of methylamphetamine, initially producing excitability, hyperactivity, agitation, and even paranoia in high doses. However, when the drug starts to wear off the body goes into a withdrawal stage, producing fatigue, decreased alertness and slower movements. The deceased’s interaction with Mr Bora, the AGL representative, was described to her, and she said that he appeared to have been “functional and not grossly impaired” at that time. She said that the methylamphetamine he had used around the middle of the day with Mr McCluskey would have been past its peak level of intoxication, and may have been at the beginning of the withdrawal stage, at around the time of the fatal incident. However, if he had used the drug later in the afternoon he could have been at his peak level of intoxication at that time. She agreed that if the deceased took to the accused with a knife and slashed his forearms, that would be consistent with the “aggressive, hostile behaviour that can occur with methylamphetamine.”
	


Verdict


	
	The history of aggression in the relationship between the deceased and the accused is relevant, insofar as it discloses a tendency on the part of both of them to react to disagreements with a measure of violence. Counsel for the accused, Mr Averre, put some weight upon the incident of the 24 May when the deceased chased the accused, armed with a machete or samurai sword. That certainly was remarkable behaviour, possibly fuelled by methylamphetamine. Nevertheless, it is not in dispute that from time to time there was aggression on both sides, and it cannot be said that the deceased exhibited a propensity to violence that was not shared by the accused.
	
	
	Whether the ingestion of methylamphetamine contributed to the deceased’s behaviour on the occasion in question and, if so, to what extent, I cannot say. Certainly, he used the drug in the company of Mr McCluskey but I can make no finding as to whether he used it again at some later stage. It is difficult to know what, if anything, should be made of his conduct towards Mr Bora before they parted which made that gentleman feel uncomfortable. In the light of Dr Perl’s evidence, I can say no more than that his behaviour is consistent with his being intoxicated by methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Nor can I make any clear finding about what triggered the incident. It appears to relate to the question of the accused leaving the townhouse, but I cannot say whether that was because the deceased had ordered him out because he was not contributing to the household, or the accused had chosen to leave because the deceased was making sexual advances towards him.
	
	
	All that said, it is clear, and the Crown prosecutor accepted, that the deceased was the original aggressor. This was consistently the accused’s account of the incident to people that night, an account which was fleshed out in some detail in the recorded interview with Detective Bristow. Of course, it is also borne out by the injuries to his forearms, particularly the deep cut to the left forearm.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor submitted that, nevertheless, the accused managed to disarm the deceased, notwithstanding his injuries, and that he should then have retreated. He argued that there was nothing in the accused’s account to suggest that he was cornered or trapped, so as to be unable to do so. He also noted that the deceased was not a larger and more powerful man than the accused. He pointed to Ms Anderson’s evidence that the deceased was losing weight and not looking after himself at the time, and in the recorded interview the accused said that he and the deceased were “about the same size” (Q 104).
	
	
	In the light of these matters, the Crown prosecutor raised an issue as to whether the accused believed that it was necessary to stab the deceased to defend himself. His principal submission, however, was directed to the issue of proportionality: that I would be satisfied that the accused’s act was not a reasonable response to the threat which he perceived.
	
	
	In response, Mr Averre noted that, on the accused’s account, the struggle between the two men continued after he had wrested the knife from the deceased. The accused said as much to Pastor Johnson. He maintained that account, in greater detail, in the recorded interview, particularly in answer to questions 97 to 103 and questions 113 to 121, referred to at [23]-[24] above. Mr Averre also relied upon the evidence of Dr Van Vuuren that his account in answer to questions 113 to 121 was consistent with her post-mortem findings.
	
	
	Mr Averre submitted that the other injuries to the deceased, including the fracture of the hyoid bone, were consistent with being caused in the course of a struggle, as were the marks on the accused’s face and the scratch marks on his chest. He noted that the accused inflicted only one stab wound on the deceased, not multiple wounds, and that that wound was to the posterior lateral aspect of the deceased’s chest, not to the front of his chest or his head or neck. All this, he argued, conveys that the accused was dealing with an ongoing confrontation from which there was no easy retreat.
	
	
	In my view, Mr Averre’s submissions should be accepted. The evidence supports a finding that the deceased’s aggression towards the accused continued even after he had been disarmed, raising the possibility that he might have got hold of the knife again and caused the accused further injury. This was so notwithstanding the relative strength of the two of them. I accept the accused’s account, referred to at [22] above, that the deceased was “going wild” and that the event happened very quickly. The accused’s reaction must be assessed in a practical, common sense way. Regard must be had to the urgency of the situation and the impossibility of a person in his position to “weigh precisely the exact measure of self-defensive action which is required”: R v Conlon (1993) 69 A Crim R 92 at 98 (Hunt CJ at CL).
	
	
	I find it reasonably possible that the accused believed that his conduct was necessary to defend himself, and that his response was reasonable in the circumstances as he perceived them. Accordingly, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was not acting in self-defence, and I find him not guilty.

2768376,R v Garaicoa [2015] NSWDC 404,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing Stephanie Garaicoa who has committed a series of very serious crimes. I should first list the crimes which she committed and then say something more about the circumstances of the crimes.
	
	
	The three crimes that she has pleaded guilty to and of which I formally convict her are these. First, she acquired a prohibited firearm without a dealer’s licence. That is an offence against s 51A(2) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW). Parliament regards it as very serious and has fixed a maximum of 14 years imprisonment to that crime. The second offence that she is convicted of is offering to supply a firearm to an unauthorised person. That is also an offence against the Firearms Act, this time against s 51(1)(a). Parliament has fixed a maximum of five years imprisonment to that offence. The third offence is called ongoing supply of a prohibited drug for reward. That is an offence against s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). Parliament regards that as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to the crime.
	
	
	Ms Garaicoa has asked me to take into account some other offences when I am sentencing her for the drug offence. She has asked me to take into account three separate drug supply offences. These are all offences against the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and when I am sentencing her for the ongoing supply offence I will take into account the three individual supply offences as she has asked me to. I have signed a certificate to that effect under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	I should now say something more about the three crimes that she has been convicted of and the additional offences that I am taking into account. The first crime of acquiring a prohibited firearm without a licence arose in circumstances where she received an SMS message in July 2014 sending her an image of what appeared to be a black handgun and offering to swap the black handgun for some drugs. Ms Garaicoa then contacted someone else to enquire about whether he wanted a firearm. That person questioned whether the firearm was a fake and asked whether it can be loaded and Ms Garaicoa told him that it could be loaded with pellets or ball bearings. The police have inspected the photograph and police experts have inspected the photograph and concluded that it is either a prohibited pistol or it may even be an imitation firearm. This offence of attempting to acquire or acquiring the prohibited firearm without a licence was committed, as I said, in July 2014.
	
	
	The following month - in August - she received a text message asking whether she still had “that pellet gun”. She replied that she did and she and the other person agreed on a price of $250 to sell it, after some negotiation. She was offering to sell this firearm contrary to the Firearms Act and that was the second offence.
	
	
	The drug offence of ongoing supply arose in these circumstances. Stephanie Garaicoa was under surveillance. Her phones were being monitored. Police were interested in her activities supplying methamphetamine, commonly known as ice. Police sent in undercover operatives and on 2 September 2014 in Homebush West she provided 14 grams of ice and received $3,800. When the police later analysed it, it was 78% pure. Just over a week later police picked up phone calls again and went again to Homebush West. Again she supplied 14 grams, this time in exchange for $4,000. On this occasion the purity was around 80%. Just under a week later she again went to Homebush West. She was monitored supplying 28 grams of ice, this time in exchange for $8,000. Again the purity was analysed to be 80%. Those three separate supplies, 2 September, 10 September and 16 September 2014 together made up a sequence of supplies which resulted in the offence of an ongoing supply.
	
	
	As I said, there were three other specific supply offences which are taken into account. One occurred on 22 October 2014 when she again received $8,000 in exchange for 28 grams of ice at Homebush West. On 11 November 2014 she exchanged 14 grams of ice for $4,000 and a third offence occurred back in August 2014 when on a search of her premises police found 22 grams of methamphetamine. In addition she was found to have a Taser where she lived and was charged with possessing a prohibited weapon. That charge is on a certificate.
	
	
	Stephanie Garaicoa has a criminal record. She is still only 24, although about to turn 25 later this month. Her criminal record includes driving offences and goods in custody offences and possession of a knife in a public place on one occasion. Up until now she has been dealt with by fines and good behaviour bonds.
	
	
	Stephanie Garaicoa was arrested for the crimes I am sentencing her for on 11 November 2014 and she has been in custody ever since. When I impose the sentence shortly, it will date from 11 November 2014.
	
	
	In addition, Stephanie Garaicoa pleaded guilty at what Mr I Davidson (who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions) agrees was the earliest available opportunity. He acknowledges that she is entitled to a discount of 25% from her sentences because of that early plea. In due course I will discount her sentences accordingly.
	
	
	Mr A Zhou appeared for Stephanie Garaicoa when the case first came on before me on 29 October this year here in Sydney. He called his client to give evidence. Her mother had died when she was only three; she apparently took an overdose of some sort and was poisoned. She ran away from home when she was 13 and by 15 gave birth to her son whose name is Silver and her son stayed with his father’s mother and father.
	
	
	Stephanie Garaicoa’s personal circumstances and background are set out in some other reports. Ms Garaicoa confirmed in evidence that she received a Centrelink benefit but her father, whom she was living with, arranged for her to sign an authority for him to receive it. He managed her account and her allowance was paid into his account. In the meantime she was financially destitute. She acknowledged the drug deliveries. She was, she said, rewarded by two or $300 or $500 for each transaction or she was given a supply of ice. Needless to say, she was an ice addict starting when she was 14 or 15 years old.
	
	
	Stephanie Garaicoa said that she has changed since her arrest and is now wanting to grow out of this drug habit and is motivated to deal with it. Mr Zhou asked how she felt about committing these offences. Her answer was much more extensive and insightful than answers normally given by offenders to that question. She said she felt bad for the offences and volunteered that drugs usually end up in somebody else who is innocent and who does not deserve to be taking the drugs. She acknowledged that it could have been someone that she cared about. The person taking the drugs could also be a mother like she is. She did not want anyone to be forced to live like she did and felt “really bad about what I did” and was coming to terms with it.
	
	
	Mr Davidson cross examined Ms Garaicoa about her drug deals. She acknowledged that she made arrangements for the supply. He asked her about what she meant by being in the middle of these drug transactions. She explained that she was the owner of neither the drugs nor the money. She spoke to the purchasers and met them. She could not remember much detail about these transactions because she was drug addicted or intoxicated at the time. Most of the time she got the drugs from the same person in order to on-sell them.
	
	
	She never owned the firearm. She could not afford to buy it. Again, she was the person in the middle of the transaction. She was interested because of the swap of something negotiable for drugs. She acknowledged to Mr Davidson that she was the first point of contact and that she indeed followed up the contact and responded to someone else to supply it to.
	
	
	In re-examination Ms Garaicoa explained that she was doing courses in custody including computers, coffee making, literacy and numeracy. She enjoys the work and is a full-time student. She is progressing and no longer needs medication. She wants to give rehabilitation a go and will do a drug and alcohol course in prison. Indeed she has been applying but needs to be sentenced to have any course confirmed. She is receiving support from the father of Silver and Silver’s grandmother who is in court today and I think might have been in court on a previous occasion.
	
	
	There was a pre-sentence report which became exhibit B. It sets out some of Stephanie Garaicoa’s personal circumstances. She stopped going to school when she was 14 and, as I said, gave birth to Silver when she was 15. After her mother died, her father remarried. She spent a couple of years in the Philippines with her stepmother and her father. She began to have problems with her stepmother and left home. Her stepmother left the country and she told the Community Corrections officer that “her father became physically abusive towards her and that she again felt that she needed to remove herself from the home”. She was effectively homeless for a time.
	
	
	Her report notes that Stephanie Garaicoa has been a full-time student while in custody and educational staff said that she has completed modules in fitness, numeracy and job seeking skills as well as computers and a TAFE hospitality course. The report said that the educational staff “confirmed that the offender’s application to learning has ‘earned’ her a full-time student role, which is restricted to ‘a select few’ due to there being only ten full-time positions available to be allocated to 300 inmates resident in the centre”. The centre is Dillwynia Correctional Centre. This is indeed impressive.
	
	
	Stephanie Garaicoa does not have any particular alcohol problem but was introduced by a previous partner to methylamphetamine and other drugs. She started using heroin as well. She confirmed that to the Community Corrections Officer about her father taking over her Centrelink payments and that remained the case “even after she left home, and which pressured her into finding alternative means of funding her living expenses and drug habit.” She admitted her guilt but could not remember the details because of the mixture of drugs she had been taking. Her motivation was to support her own drug habit. She confirmed the Community Corrections Officer her appreciation of the risks of drug taking and the harm. She was assessed as a medium-high risk of re-offending with a list of what are described as ‘criminogenic needs’. It was thought that she would comply with community supervision because of her good record in custody. The author thought that she may require to undertake and complete a long-term residential drug and alcohol program. In custody she has the opportunity to undertake either the Intensive Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program called ‘IDATP’ - a custody based program of six to nine months - or EQUIP which is an addictions program after which an offender can apply for admission to a transitional centre. The author thought that she would benefit from a period of supervision.
	
	
	When the case was last before me in October I adjourned it to today to receive an up to date report about the courses available to her. Despite Mr Zhou’s efforts a report has not been forthcoming. My associate was able to contact somebody in the Correctional Services this afternoon and I have read onto the record the contents of exhibit C which is a memorandum I asked her to prepare summarising the conversation which she had.
	
	
	Mr Zhou obtained a detailed psychological report form a psychologist who is also a social worker named Phil Gorrell. He, too, took the history which I have recounted about her past and her difficulties. There is also a history of domestic violence between her and the father of Silver, and her relationship with her own father who is described as “an abusive alcoholic who had her sign something that allowed him to collect her social security payments”. She came to associate with the wrong people because she was destitute.
	
	
	Mr Gorrell noted that academically when she was in the Philippines “she did particularly well” and has continued with her education in custody. She was diagnosed by a GP as suffering from anxiety which is hardly surprising. He noted the drug history as well. He asked her about the weapons. The Taser was, she said, for her own protection and the weapon which was being negotiated was described by her as a BB gun “being an air gun which shoots pellets”. That is consistent with her description at the time.
	
	
	Mr Gorrell administered some tests to assess the level of any depression and anxiety and found in fact that Ms Garaicoa “is suffering neither depression nor anxiety” but he thought that she has a psychological state known as “learned helplessness”. He thought that her upbringing was “most unusual and is significantly most disturbing” and that she has “no one who supports her and no one offering her help”. He noted that that was the situation for much of her life. Having received very questionable parenting she has had to move away from situations of abuse a number of times. He noted that her life was aimed purely at survival. He agreed that she would require residential drug rehabilitation but added that what she really needs is “re parenting”. She needs an intensive and comprehensive rehabilitation program and unless she receives it she “will only return to the life that she previously knew, and trouble will commence again”. He recommended a particular facility being Dooralong Transformation Centre. He thought that there were limitations on the services provided in custody because there was no guaranteed place and their follow up may not be as intensive.
	
	
	Ms Garaicoa herself wrote out as exhibit 2 a letter to the Court confirming a lot of what I have referred to but added that she has a little brother who has just turned 18. His name is Nathan and he now lives in America. In gaol she is anxious for her son, her father and her brother. She said that the medication in prison has helped her stabilise her emotions.
	
	
	I have had the benefit of helpful written submissions prepared by Mr Zhou. They became MFI 4. He set out a number of relevant factors including there being special circumstances for adjusting the normal relationship between a full sentence and the non-parole period component. Usually the non-parole period is 75% of the full sentence but he argued that it can be less than that in this case because of Ms Garaicoa’s age and what he described as her good prospects of rehabilitation and the fact that this is her first time in custody. I think her prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable rather than good, I am hoping that they are good but judges learn to be realistic in assessing these prospects. She is making all the right steps and hopefully will proceed in the way.
	
	
	Mr Zhou started by arguing that I should release his client so that she could undertake the residential drug rehabilitation program referred to by the psychologist. Mr Davidson opposed that. Mr Davidson must be right. The offences which Ms Garaicoa has committed are simply too serious for her to be released before serving some significant period in custody. She has after all committed firearms offences including one that carries a maximum of 14 years imprisonment and an ongoing drug supply offence carrying a maximum of 20 years imprisonment and three separate drug supply offences that I have to take into account. She must spend more time in gaol; otherwise the sentence would be far too lenient.
	
	
	Mr Zhou argued that some of the sentences can be partially or fully concurrent because of the single episode of offending involved in the firearms offences. There is some force in that but, on the other hand, the negotiations were some time apart. They did not occur all on the same day so far as the two offences were concerned. She really engaged in the drug trade, Mr Zhou argued, in order to support her own habit and was not profiting from it in a sense of making surplus money but was making money on the side so that she could buy her own drugs.
	
	
	Mr Davidson on the other hand emphasised that the three supply offences which made up the one offence of ongoing supply resulted in her passing on more than 50 grams of high grade methamphetamines over a short period of time. In addition, I have to take into account, as I have already said, the three additional supply offences. Indeed, those three additional supply offences amounted to just short of 120 grams. That in turn is just short of half the commercial quantity. He agreed that the firearms offences were low range offences but nevertheless objectively serious in each case.
	


HIS HONOUR: Yes, Mr Davidson.

DAVIDSON: I am loathe to interrupt at this stage, your Honour. Just in relation to your Honour’s last remark about the total quantity of the drug involved in the Form 1 offences.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

DAVIDSON: Your Honour made reference to it being almost ‘120 grams’. Your Honour, that’s the total of all the drugs supplied. The three Form 1 offences are, just doing the maths now, your Honour, I have 63.2--

HIS HONOUR: Yes, it must be just over 60.

DAVIDSON: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Thanks, Mr Davidson.


	
	Mr Davidson has just corrected me. The 120 grams of drugs represents the total amount of drug supplied by Ms Garaicoa. That comprised about 55 grams of the ongoing supplies and 60 or so grams of the individual supplies. He emphasised her independent role in the drug negotiations and acknowledged the case for special circumstances to vary the normal ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period but he emphasised again the necessity for a prison sentence which involved full-time custody. He emphasised that the two firearms offences cannot be completed concurrently because they were quite separate and committed sometime apart. I think he is right about that.
	
	
	I have to now take all this into account and work out what an appropriate sentence is for these crimes. Looking at the offence of acquiring a prohibited firearm - carrying a maximum of 14 years imprisonment - it is on the lower side of seriousness and I would regard an appropriate sentence for that offence as being three years and six months imprisonment.
	
	
	So far as the offering to supply a firearm to an unauthorised person - carrying a maximum of five years imprisonment - again it is on the lower side of seriousness and I would regard an appropriate sentence as being one year and six months or 18 months imprisonment.
	
	
	The ongoing supply of drugs offence, including the three separate supply offences which I must take into account, attract a maximum of 20 years imprisonment. They were serious crimes. I had in mind that it should be quite a significant sentence but I note from MFI 2 - the statistics for sentencing for this offence produced by the New South Wales Judicial Commission - that just under 70% of sentences for that offence are of three years or less. The database reflects almost 250 individual sentences. I am a little surprised by that. I, myself, in light of that would regard an appropriate sentence as one of three years and six months; that is 42 months imprisonment.
	
	
	What I have to do now that I have indicated what those individual sentences is to discount them because Ms Garaicoa pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity to the three crimes. That means she is entitled to have the sentences discounted by 25%. The first offence will be discounted from three years and six months down to two years and six months. I am rounding off the calculations. The second offence will be discounted from one year and six months to one year and one month. The third offence will be discounted from three years and six months to two years and six months.
	
	
	I do agree with Mr Davidson that there needs to be some accumulation or overlap for the sentences I impose for the two firearms offences. If I was to simply impose the two years and six months and the one year and one month it would be a sentence of three years and seven months imprisonment. I think an appropriate overlap is a sentence of three years imprisonment. Then, of course, I have to add the sentence of two years and six months for the drug supply offence. I will let that overlap to some extent so that an overall appropriate sentence for all of the crimes will be four years and six months.
	
	
	I now have to fix a non-parole period. Normally a non-parole period for a prison sentence of four years and six months is 75% of that. So it would be three years and four months. However I am going to reduce that 75% because of the special circumstances referred to by Mr Zhou and acknowledged by Mr Davidson. In particular I take into account Ms Garaicoa’s relatively young age. I am going to fix a non-parole period of two years and six months.
	


HIS HONOUR:    I am now going to sentence you.


	
	I will fix one aggregate sentence instead of three individual sentences.   I sentence you to four years and six months. It commenced on 11 November 2014 and the overall sentence will expire on 10 May 2019. The non-parole period is two years and six months, that also commenced on 11 November 2014, that will expire on 10 May 2017.
	


HIS HONOUR:    Just have a seat there, Ms Garaicoa. Mr Davidson and Mr Zhou, first the mathematics. Would you please, just carefully, don’t rush, check the maths and make sure that I have the dates - they coincide with the sentences that I have indicated, please?

DAVIDSON: Yes, I accept they do your Honour. Yes.

HIS HONOUR: All right. Mr Zhou?

ZHOU: Yes, there is no issue your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Sorry.

ZHOU: The dates are correct, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: The dates are correct. Okay. I don’t fix parole because the sentence is over three years but I need to just repeat the explanation.


	
	The formal order which I make is that under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) I impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of four years and six months to commence 11 November 2014 and to expire on 10 May 2019. I fix a non-parole period of two years and six months to commence 11 November 2014 and to expire on 10 May 2017. The sentences that would have been imposed for each offence are the sentences that I indicated during my remarks on sentence.
	


HIS HONOUR: Ms Garaicoa the overall sentence you’ve got is four and a half years and that will finally expire on 10 May 2019. The non-parole period, instead of being three years and four months, I’ve brought that down to two years and six months. You’ve done over a year of that already, so you’ve got about 18 months to go and that will expire on 10 May 2017. 10 May 2017 is the first day on which you will be eligible for parole. Whether you get parole or not and what conditions depends on the Parole Authority. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Okay. Is there anything else that I need, any orders, Mr Davidson?

DAVIDSON: Yes, your Honour. A couple of matters, your Honour. There’s the remaining matter on the 166 certificate which is the sequence 9, it’s a summary offence, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Of?

DAVIDSON: Although it can be dealt with on indictment, your Honour, the maximum summary penalty is two years imprisonment. Your Honour, the Crown would accept a considerable degree of totality is appropriate in a circumstance like this. Although, your Honour, I then would submit that it is in itself a serious offence as articulated in Cao which was referred to during submissions earlier, in my respectful submission a period of imprisonment is required but the Crown would accept a significant measure of totality is appropriate in these circumstances.

HIS HONOUR: They are supply offences, is that right?

DAVIDSON: No.

HIS HONOUR: No, no they’re not?

DAVIDSON: It’s possess a prohibited weapon which is the Taser.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. Prohibited drug. Possess prohibited weapon.

DAVIDSON: Yes, that’s the offence, your Honour, sequence 9.

HIS HONOUR: They’re the two?

DAVIDSON: Yes. Sequence 9. Yes. Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Two offences on--

DAVIDSON: No, just one, your Honour. Just one.

HIS HONOUR: Which one?

DAVIDSON: Sequence 9.

HIS HONOUR: What’s it called though, what’s the offence on, what you call sequence 9, what is it?

DAVIDSON: Yes, your Honour, excuse me, I’ll just take your Honour to that.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, tell me what it is?

DAVIDSON: Your Honour, it’s an offence under s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998.

HIS HONOUR: Possessing or using a prohibited weapon without a permit?

DAVIDSON: Yes. That’s so, yes.

HIS HONOUR: My associate thinks that there are, there’s a backup offence - yes. And there’s unaccounted for three supplies, one possess a prohibited drug and one possess a prohibited weapon.

DAVIDSON: Yes, your Honour, the only matter the Crown is seeking a plea to is sequence 9 which is the Taser offence and my friend has indicated there will be a plea of guilty.

HIS HONOUR: That’s the prohibited weapon?

DAVIDSON: Yes, that’s so. Yes.

HIS HONOUR: And the others you are agreeing can be dismissed?

DAVIDSON: That’s so, your Honour, I have directions to seek that to occur, yes.

HIS HONOUR: All right.


	
	All of the related or backup offences are dismissed under the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 with the exception of the offence of possessing or using a prohibited weapon without a permit. That is an offence against s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW).
	


HIS HONOUR: Is that right?

DAVIDSON: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: What’s the maximum, Mr Davidson?

DAVIDSON: When dealt with summarily, your Honour, it’s two years imprisonment which is the--

HIS HONOUR: But on indictment?

DAVIDSON: Five years, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: And I am dealing with it on indictment, aren’t I?

DAVIDSON: No, your Honour, summarily. Yes. And that’s why it’s on the 166 certificate which gives your Honour summary jurisdiction.


	
	I fix a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment to commence on 11 November 2014 and it will expire on 10 August 2015.
	


HIS HONOUR: So that sentence has expired. The Taser. I have given you nine months for that. It started last year and finished in August. That make sense, you understand that’s finished?

OFFENDER: Yes. Does March 10 still exist even though you sentenced me already for - to August last year.

HIS HONOUR: Does what still exist?

OFFENDER: Does those other dates that you gave me exist?

HIS HONOUR: They’re still there. Yes. Yes. The main dates you’ve got to remember are the main dated 10 May 17, that’s when you’re eligible for parole. 10 May 17, you’ve got about another 18 months to go and your sentence will finally finish on 10 May 19, so you’re two years on parole once you’re given parole you’re on it straightaway.


	
	Mr Davidson and Mr Zhou, anything else?
	


ZHOU: Nothing further from the defence.

HIS HONOUR: No. Mr Davidson.

HIS HONOUR: I just want you to be able to - you understand Ms Garaicoa what the sentence is. I’ve said it several times. Hopefully that will mean that you’ll have some certainty now and they will be able to process you. That report, the helpful report from the psychologist will help. The sentence had to be as high as it was because of the serious offending you got yourself involved in. We just can’t have that sort of thing going on in the community. In fact I sentenced somebody this morning who got hold of a makeshift firearm and did all sorts of damage. So it’s over to you now. It sounds as though you’re doing pretty well in custody with your courses and your education. That’s really good. I am hoping that you will continue with that and that now you will get signed up for that rehab course. And just keep your head down and you are doing well, so keep up the good work. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes. Thank you.

HIS HONOUR: All right. Good luck. Anything else?

ZHOU: Nothing, your Honour.

DAVIDSON: No. Nothing, your Honour.

		04 August 2016",2015-12-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768377,R v Smith [2015] NSWDC 373,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The internet has brought about many wonderful advances. We have available to us a vast amount of information. We are able to communicate instantly with people across the world. Our smart phones enable us to navigate through strange cities and identify songs on the radio. In so many ways our lives have been improved by this technological advancement.
	
	
	But one thing the internet has undeniably brought about is a vast opportunity for evil people to profit from the sexual abuse of children in order to satisfy what is to me an amazingly inexplicable desire to view child pornography.
	
	
	Presumably in the past, those interested in viewing child pornography found it difficult to do so. At a time when images were recorded on film and printed on paper, obtaining such images would not have been easy. Even more so would this be the case for moving images. But it would seem, now that such images are freely available to be transmitted throughout the world, that an enormous number of people, usually men, obtain their sexual gratification by viewing such images and videos.
	
	
	Many times Courts have explained the reasons that offences such as the ones I am dealing with today are serious. The most obvious reason, but it is worth repeating despite its obviousness, is that by creating a demand for such images and videos, evil people will satisfy that demand, and every time they do, a child is harmed. Sometimes that harm will be enormous. Every time the harm will be singnificant.
	
	
	The Crown today attempted to tender what it said was a representative sample of images. I refused to receive that, for reasons I expressed. One does not need to look at the images to understand how harmful it would be for a child to be used in the production of images and videos which show penetrative sexual activity between children, or adults and children, and, even more so, images and videos depicting sadism humiliation and bestiality.
	
	
	Harm is also caused to children where they are depicted posing erotically, where there is non-penetrative sexual activity between children, or solo masturbation by a child, and non-penetrative sexual activity between adults and children.
	
	
	It is primarily because of such harm that offenders who are discovered having downloaded and possessed such images and videos usually go to gaol immediately, and for significant periods of time.
	
	
	The offender, Luke Daniel Smith, has pleaded guilty to two offences, using a carriage service to access child pornography and possessing child abuse material. He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to such offences. He was arraigned today but he had earlier been committed for sentence to this Court following his pleas of guilty in the Local Court. I will take into account those pleas of guilty for the State charge as representing a utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system and on the Commonwealth charge as demonstrating a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. In each case the sentence will be about 25 per cent less than it would otherwise have been. His pleas of guilty are also one of a number of factors which has led to me imposing a different form of sentence, or at least contemplating the imposition of a different form of sentence, from that I would otherwise have imposed.
	
	
	These offences were discovered when police went to the offender’s home. In his bedroom they found a computer and a number of hard drives. The computer was protected by a password, which Mr Smith disclosed to police so that they could access the contents of the computer and storage devices. Consistent with that co-operation he made immediate admissions to police.
	
	
	What police found were in total, 1,511 images and 431 video files which were classified as being child abuse material. The victims depicted appeared to be in the age from about seven to about 16. The Crown facts note that there was a significant amount of duplication between the examined hard drives. Mr Smith gave evidence today that when he bought a new hard drive, he would simply dump all the contents of his old hard drive onto the new one, thus creating two copies of the same image or video.
	
	
	Police estimated there were about 150 different victims depicted in the files. Mr Carney, who appears for the accused, has helpfully identified what proportion of the images and videos fall into which category using the categories identified under the child exploitation tracking system. It is important to understand that although those categories use the numbers 1 to 6, category 6 is not the worst category, category 5 is. Category 6 depicts animated or virtual depictions of children engaged in sexual poses or activity and so category 6 does not involve an actual child at all. For that reason, I will focus on categories 1 to 5.
	
	
	There were a small proportion of images and videos in category 5, less than one per cent, but a significant number in category 4, about 10 per cent. The vast majority however, of images and videos appeared in categories 1, 63 per cent or 2, 20 per cent.
	
	
	In assessing the objective criminality of the offender’s conduct, I note that as matters go, this was a relatively small number of images and videos and most of them, the vast proportion, about 84 per cent indeed, were in categories 1 and 2. This is a significant factor which distinguishes Mr Smith’s offending from many other offences of this type which come before the Courts.
	
	
	Many offences involve vast numbers of images and videos extending into the tens of thousands with enormous numbers of images and videos in categories 4 and 5. Focussing on the harm caused to individual children for the moment, these offences which I am dealing with today are, when compared to many other offences, much less serious. That of course, is not to say that they are not serious offences. Indeed they are, for the reasons I have already identified.
	
	
	There is one other unusual circumstance. The offender became involved in using the internet for pornographic purposes from a young age, as he explored his sexuality. As part of this, he began to communicate with others who exploited him. He was asked to and did in fact send images and videos of himself doing sexual things when he was 14 or 15 years of age. So in a very real sense, he has been a victim of the very offences for which he must now be sentenced.
	
	
	The offender is of otherwise good character. He has been a hard worker for a supermarket chain. It is of some concern that he has not yet told them that he has pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography. Quite clearly, it is highly likely that he will lose his job once he does so. That is scarcely an excuse for not having done what he should have done some time ago.
	
	
	His childhood had some areas of unhappiness. His parents separated and there has been conflict between the offender, his parents and his step-parents from time to time, including, most regrettably, when he told his mother that he was gay.
	
	
	He appears to be a somewhat socially isolated person who has thus far occupied most of his time working. He is now in a relationship with another man and accepts the wrongfulness of what he has done. He has made attempts to obtain counselling but for various reasons has not, thus far, been counselled as regards his misconduct.
	
	
	One issue that came up during the course of these proceedings concerned the question as to whether the offender had been complying with his bail conditions. One of those conditions was that he not use the internet, unless it was for purposes such as employment. A pre-sentence report tendered by the Crown suggested that the offender had breached that condition of bail by using the internet to access adult pornography. The offender denied doing so in Court and when I inquired of the Crown whether he wished to call the author of the pre-sentence report to resolve this dispute, the Crown said that he did not wish to do so. Accordingly, given the sworn evidence of the offender, I will not sentence him on the basis that he has breached his bail conditions.
	
	
	Of course the number and type of images and videos is but one consideration, perhaps the most important, but still only one, in determining an appropriate sentence. I note that there is no suggestion that the offender disseminated anything. There was no suggestion of any profit motive, or that there was a risk of these images becoming accessible to anyone else. I also note the offender has also expressed his remorse. When he first saw images and videos, depicting sadism, bestiality or humiliation, he told me that he was somewhat aroused but disgusted at the same time. He now accepts that he should not have had that reaction. He now accepts the harm that production of such material caused.
	
	
	It was Mr Carney’s submission that although a sentence of imprisonment was required, he submitted that this was likely to be two years or less and accordingly his client should be assessed as to his suitability to serve his sentence by means of an intensive corrections order.
	
	
	The Crown, in his written submissions, said that a sentence of imprisonment was required, but upon inquiry from me, confirmed that he would not speak in opposition to the imposition of an Intensive Corrections Order. As I explained to the parties, that does not necessarily mean that I would do what they jointly considered was appropriate. I made my own mind up. I am satisfied that this is one of those cases where full-time imprisonment may not be necessary. I have identified the unusual features of this case and they have persuaded me that, if acceptable, the offender is likely to receive a sentence of other than full-time imprisonment. Accordingly, I make the following order:
	
	
	I continue the offender’s bail to 26 February
	
	
	I consider it is likely that the sentence of imprisonment to be imposed upon the offender is two years or less. I refer him for an assessment as to his suitability to serve that sentence by means of an Intensive Corrections order.
	
	
	Mr Smith, it is a matter for you but I would have thought, as I expressed to you when you were giving evidence, part of your obligations now would be to tell your employer what has happened, consistent with someone who is prepared to accept responsibility for their own actions and that would include telling your employer what you have done and what is likely to happen.

		24 February 2016",2015-12-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768380,R v Green [2015] NSWDC 387,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Steven Mathew Green appears today for sentence in relation to two offences to which he pleaded guilty at the Wagga Wagga District Court in early August 2015.
	
	
	The crimes that he pleaded guilty to were, firstly, that he on 22 August 2013 at Junee in the State of New South Wales did wound Brad Allen with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to him. This is an offence contrary to s 33(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and has a standard non-parole period of seven years.
	
	
	The second offence to which he pleaded guilty was an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company with Sean John Frederick Green, his brother, upon the victim Brad Allen, on the same date at the same place. This crime carries, accordingly to the cover sheet provided to me by the Crown, a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment, and has no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	I am required also to take into account a matter on a Form 1, an offence of affray, committed again on 22 August at Junee, which concerns itself in effect with the fight that occurred with the victim in the vicinity of the Junee Hotel, and is intimately connected to the facts to be found in respect of the wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and assault occasioning actual bodily harm matters.
	
	
	In taking into account the matter on the Form 1 I do so in accordance with the guideline judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal (Attorney General’s Application (No 1), (2002) 56 NSWLR 147), particularly the observations of the Chief Justice at [18]-[43]. In my view the matter on the Form 1 is not one which requires greater weight to be placed upon retribution and personal deterrence, as often will be the case with matters on a Form 1, given its character is subsumed into the criminality involved in the primary offence. I need say nothing more about the matter on the Form 1.
	
	
	The facts on sentence were provided to me in a form where particular matters were “underlined” to identify what was said to be disputes between the position of the Crown and the position of the defence. The disputed facts were brought to my attention when the prisoner pleaded guilty at Wagga Wagga and the matter was remanded back to this Court for those disputes to be resolved. Mr Green appeared before me on 6 November 2015 and a large part of that day was spent taking evidence from a number of people to whom I will refer shortly, and reading statements, and other documents relevant to the subject matter of the oral evidence. The prisoner gave evidence and, as it transpired when all was said and done at the end of the evidentiary phase, the bulk of the submissions were concerned with the area of disputed fact. The submissions as to the actual technicality and scope of the sentencing exercise were relatively short.
	
	
	The prisoner and Sean Green, as I said earlier, were brothers. I must point out in passing in order to deal with the disputed facts I need to go into some detail from the statement of facts. It is not a matter where I can deal with the agreed facts, so to speak, in summary form. The two brothers, and a man called Brad Allen - the victim of these crimes that I am concerned with - were all employed by a company responsible for rail track maintenance in The Riverina. The victim was in fact the direct supervisor of the Greens and it would appear to me, on the totality of the evidence, that there was some underlying tension existing between the victim and the prisoner particularly concerned with their working relationship, although it was not clearly articulated.
	
	
	I make that observation as a reference to the content of the matter. I certainly draw no inference adverse to the prisoner to the effect that the prisoner was responsible for any discord that existed out of the working relationship. The character of the discord sat sub silentio in the proceedings and was not particularly addressed.
	
	
	The victim was 27 years of age. The prisoner at the relevant time was 22, and his brother Sean was 19. The prisoner and his brother arrived in Junee, which is well known in The Riverina area as a “Railway Town”, on 11 August 2014 to conduct their work. The prisoner, his brother, and a number of other people working in the crew of about 16, undertaking track maintenance between Junee and Cootamundra, stayed at the Junee Motel. I have had a lot of oral evidence of the layout of this western side of the Junee township, and I have examined maps, and seen photographs and even a CCTV recording of relevant events, which has given me some understanding of the relationship of particular places one to the other.
	
	
	Closer to the railway line and the railway station is the Junee Hotel. It is located at 17 Seignior Street, which appears to run parallel with the main Sydney/Melbourne railway line, and the hotel itself is almost directly opposite the Junee railway station.
	
	
	The motel is further to the west of the railway line and according to the facts is about 350 metres from the hotel. The main thoroughfare that links Seignior Street to the motel is a street that is called Broadway Street. The victim, apparently to save some money, was staying in cheaper accommodation at the hotel.
	
	
	I appreciate that the prisoner, and his brother, and everybody else working in the gang - once upon a time called fettlers - had worked hard during the day, and they came back to Junee at about 6pm and started to drink excessively after initially having some showers and something to eat. They drank at the Junee Hotel and the Green brothers were drinking with the victim. There were a number of other people drinking there amongst whom were their work colleagues.
	
	
	The crew, if I can call them that, who stayed at Junee Motel had struck up apparently some friendship, or relationship, with two young women, Ms Moylan and Ms Philpott. Some time after 11.55pm the hotel closed and a number of members of the work crew, including the victim, the prisoners, and other men, as well as the two young women, went back to the motel for some socialising. I assume, being a Wednesday night as I understand it, the men had to get up early in the morning to go back to the maintenance of the railway track. But that did not seem to be inhibiting anybody’s ingestion of alcohol, or socialising, on this particular night.
	
	
	I point out in passing a a statement from John Dargin produced on behalf of the prisoner, tendered in the course of the evidence before the Court in relation to the disputed facts who was, as I understand it, the owner/manager of the Junee Hotel in 2013. He deals with a number of the contextual issues, but particularly refers to the fact that some time after 11.15pm he heard the victim saying words to the effect that he, “wanted to hit somebody”. The manager of the hotel was not sure who he was talking about, but it turned out that he was talking about the prisoner, Steven Green. It is the case that the younger brother, Sean, was apparently trying to diffuse the situation, and it is also clear from that statement that not only had the group of people drinking together drunk a great deal of alcohol, but the prisoner Steven Green, was concerned that the hotel should remain open, at least behind closed doors so to speak, and he could continue drinking.
	
	
	A group of people then left the Junee Hotel and made their way back to the motel, I have seen the CCTV footage of that group walking back to the motel along what I understand to be Broadway Street. That CCTV footage I was provided is also important because at a later time, some time after around about 1.59am, the victim can be seen stumbling towards the direction of the Junee Hotel, having come from the Junee Motel, pursued by the Green brothers wearing clothing that can distinguish the two of them and footage of their return to their accommodation.
	
	
	Back at the motel people continued to drink and somehow the two women ended up in one of the rooms in circumstances that I need not dwell upon. About 1.30am, however the two Green brothers and the victim were outside what was described as ‘Room 1’, having an argument, and the two women particularly speak of hearing raised voices and the like. It was the prisoner’s evidence, and certainly is asserted in the statement of facts, that in the course of this argument the prisoner and the victim ended up in a nature strip in the middle of Broadway Street, nearby to the hotel. That is where the stabbing of the victim occurred on the evidence of the prisoner. This is one of the primary “disputed facts”.
	
	
	At some stage after the argument had started the victim did return to the Junee Hotel, and I have referred to CCTV footage showing him “stumbling” along the footpath back towards the hotel at 1.59am with the two Green brothers in what I would regard as hot pursuit. The facts provided to the Court refer to a witness called Luke Moor hearing voices. He was staying, or living, in a two storey terrace building immediately next to the hotel. I have photographs of its relationship to the hotel. His bedroom was located upstairs. He heard arguing, or yelling, outside. When he came out onto the balcony, presumably to quell the sound, he saw three people in the street below, one was the victim and the other two were the two Green brothers. He did not know any of the men but he gave descriptions which clearly can distinguish Steven Green, the prisoner, from his brother.
	
	
	The victim was being held by the front of his shirt upright against a motor vehicle and he was dragged to the ground, the victim was trying to protect himself. The Crown alleges that the victim was stabbed by the prisoner at some point whilst he was being held against the motor vehicle, and ultimately I am satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt for reasons I will explain later.
	
	
	Once the victim was on the ground Sean Green punched the victim once with a closed fist. The victim lay motionless on the ground, and it was at this point that Steven Green kicked the victim to the back of the head and did so a number of times. Whilst the kicking was taking place it is alleged Sean Green said, “Ease up” and Steven Green was heard to say, “Fuck him, I’m going to kill his whole family”. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt these words were said by the prisoner.
	
	
	In fact ultimately when one analyses the evidence such as it was given by the prisoner about these matters he cannot dispute this aspect of the disputed facts hearing. Furthermore, Mr Moor shouted down to the brothers below to leave the victim alone, which was reasonable enough. Steven Green, the prisoner, shouted back to Mr Moor, “Come down here and I’ll stab you too”. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt those words were said. Again the prisoner offers no answer to Mr Moor’s evidence other than to say ultimately he does not remember saying it.
	
	
	The two brothers then walked off. The victim lay motionless on the ground. Mr Moor rang for the ambulance and assistance was provided to the victim. I need not go into that. Some people who provided statements to police saw two people wearing clothing similar to the two brothers at various times. I had oral evidence from two train drivers, Mr Greg Richards and Mr Darryl Fitzgerald, who, as I understood their evidence, were standing on the railway station looking westward at particular times towards the Junee Hotel, perhaps slightly in a nor-westerly direction. They were however some considerable distance away from relevant events.
	
	
	The victim, as I said, was tended to and I need not dwell upon that. Ms Moylan and Ms Philpott were still at the motel and about to go home when the two Green brothers returned to the motel. Ms Moylan, I believe, gave evidence that she asked the brothers what they had been doing, to which the prisoner, as I understand her evidence, said “Fuck off, cunt”, which to my mind reflects a level of belligerence and a degree of awareness of what was going on on the part of the prisoner at that particular time. Ms Moylan and Ms Philpott returned to the hotel, where I gather they had more permanent residence, to find the victim being treated.
	
	
	The victim had to be taken to Wagga Wagga Base Hospital from Junee Hospital and then had to be transferred to St George Hospital for emergency or intensive treatment. He had the following injuries:
	
	
	A two centimetre penetrating wound to the right upper chest just lateral to the sternum; a superficial incised wound to the right upper quadrant of his abdomen; an abrasion to his forehead above his right eye; a one centimetre incised wound to the left lateral eyebrow which required two sutures; two incised wound to the medial aspect of the right arm approximately one centimetres in length, and the other three centimetre in length, for which suturing was required.
	
	
	This clearly was a man suffering very serious injuries and there is no doubt that he suffered both grievous bodily harm, and actual bodily harm from the assault. The extent to which he was stabbed is not made clear, I could only be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was stabbed once, the primary wound being the wound to the right upper chest.
	
	
	A trauma surgeon who gave evidence before me, Dr Mary Langcake, treated the victim, and she noted that the victim suffered a cut through his right internal mammary artery. She gave her expert opinion both in statement form and in oral evidence that the artery would have gone into spasm or contracted. Such a process may have slowed the amount of blood loss, and she expressed the opinion that it was possible that the victim may have walked for an indeterminate distance after being stabbed, but she thought it unlikely in the circumstances the victim would have walked or stumbled for the distance that he would have on the accused’s version having regard to the circumstances as she understood it. She expressed other opinions based upon requests for further information from the officers of the learned Director of Public Prosecutions.
	
	
	She was asked about the depth of the wound to the chest, and the reference in her statement to the depth of the wound of the chest of Mr Allen being 4.68 centimetres.
	
	
	She was asked whether this was a reference to the fact that the wound had gone a further 4 centimetres into the chest cavity, meaning a total depth of 8.86 centimetres. She said it was impossible to state the exact depth of the wound suffered. She said:
	


“Since the average depth of the male chest wall in this position is 4.86 centimetres as previously stated, the weapon has penetrated at least 4 centimetres into the chest cavity to cause the injury, not 4.86 centimetres plus further centimetres, as this could not be determined by the available imaging nor at the time of surgery. To penetrate this far” (I took that to mean to the distance that she could best estimate through skin and muscle) “would require significant force”.


	
	She went on to say about the walking or running 350 metres after receiving the stab wound:
	


“The injury that Mr Allen suffered transected (cut through) his right internal mammary artery. When an artery is injured it spasms (contracts) which can for a period of time slow the amount of blood which the artery is losing, therefore it is possible that Mr Allen did walk for a distance after being injured. It is highly unlikely that he would have been able to run as this would have caused an increase in his heart rate and therefore further bleeding, which would have led to earlier collapse. I am unable to state what distance he would have been able to walk after the injury.”


	
	In her oral evidence she, to some extent, expanded upon the various opinions expressed in the report and supplementary report. She said in relation to the matter that with the reaction to the injury, people will have a “fight or flight” reaction which will cause them in certain circumstances to do extraordinary things to avoid further harm, even as a matter of instinct. I raised with her to my mind the famous example of Erich Maria Remarque’s book All Quiet on the Western Front and his observations of wounded men endeavouring to avoid falling down and dying where they were shot, running sometimes on the stumps of their legs.
	
	
	She also expressed opinions about the matter that were directly raised by the prisoner in his oral evidence concerning whether the injury that she treated, that is the injury to the chest, could have been caused by a “butterknife”. She said in the report and in her oral evidence that an implement that would cause a wound of this nature and of this depth would have to have had at least one sharp bladed side to it. She said:
	


“In my experience butter knives don’t have that, and the reason I can say that is that the chest wall is thick in that area. Skin is very tough and it will require being a sharp implement to penetrate to that depth.”


	
	She said in relation to the issue of the use of a “bread and butterknife”, in response to questions from learned counsel for the prisoner:
	


“Unless it was sharpened that would be difficult to envisage simply again because of my experience in doing thoracic surgery and knowing that if the scalpel blade is blunt, for instance, it is actually very difficult to get through the various layers.”


	
	It is widely known that in terms of knife wounds causing fatal injury and the like, particularly to the chest and stomach, that the major barrier to penetration is penetrating the outer layer of skin. Once that occurs the relevant weapon, depending upon its sharpness, can penetrate very deeply with minimal force after penetration. Be that as it may, she also pointed out that the position of the wound on the torso does not necessarily correspond directly to where the implement has come through into the chest cavity, it depends on trajectory, “The wound, as I would describe it, was relevantly adjacent in this case, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s gone through at a perpendicular angle.”
	
	
	A blood sample was taken from the victim at 10.25am on 22 August. That would be, on my calculation, over eight hours after he was wounded, and even then he had a blood alcohol reading of 0.083 grams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, which shows to my mind, without further expert evidence, that he would have had a very high concentration of blood alcohol at the earlier hour. I would expect that the prisoner and his brother were similarly affected as was the victim, given the other evidence about their drinking.
	
	
	The prisoner and his brother were eventually spoken to by police on 26 August and as is clear from the statement of facts, both taking part in electronic interviews, they provided absolutely no cooperation to the police in relation to this matter and certainly made no critical admissions against interests. They admitted that they were at the hotel drinking with the victim and they admitted that they went back to the motel with others, where they had a few more drinks but both said that they went to bed at about 1.30am. They did not leave the motel until the following day, they said, and they denied being involved in any incident with the victim.
	
	
	The account the prisoner gave was obviously false by reference to the evidence he gave before me, and of course that is a relevant matter to assessing his credibility in other respects. I must say in passing the prisoner sought in almost a throwaway line to suggest that we should all go off and have a look at the drain outside the Junee Motel to look for the weapon. It is a a shame that he was not prepared either himself or instruct his legal representatives, to ask the prosecuting authorities to go and look for the weapon before the matter came before me.
	
	
	The prisoner certainly did not provide any assistance to the investigators to find the weapon because, as I say, he denied any involvement. No weapon has ever been found. There was no blood trail along the 350 metres from the vicinity of the motel to the location where the victim was being physically assaulted. I am mindful that rain fell at Junee in the hours after the victim was assaulted, but part of the route followed by the victim was also, as the CCTV footage makes clear, along a footpath that was under cover.
	
	
	The victim has no memory of the incident. He remembers the night of the incident drinking alcohol with his workmates and then standing in the street with blood on his shirt and then waking up in hospital. He cannot recall being stabbed or assaulted, and I was not, as far as I can see in the bundle, provided with any victim impact statement.
	
	
	As I said ultimately the disputed facts hearing concentrated on these issues, where the stabbing occurred and whether the Crown had proven beyond reasonable doubt that it was outside the Junee Hotel, the circumstances of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company of the victim and whether the knife used was one as asserted by the prisoner to be “a butterknife”. I am mindful of the fact the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt essential facts relevant to the proof of guilt. The character of the weapon is one such fact in my view. The location of the stabbing is to my mind a matter the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt. The circumstances of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	As I have already pointed out, when one considers the prisoner’s evidence the matters to be determined in relation to the last issue that I have just described were barely troubled by the evidence of the prisoner. He could offer no answer at all to the essential facts alleged by the Crown in relation to that matter. But, interestingly enough, he was adamant about the character of the weapon and the location of the stabbing. This is coming from a person who claims that he has no memory of the things that he said to Mr Moor.
	
	
	With regard to the evidence of Dr Langcake I have had regard to that and I have also had regard to the various witnesses who gave evidence before me. One such witness was a lady who worked at a bakery and was required as part of her responsibilities at that bakery to start work some time after 1.30am on the morning of 22 August. That witness, as with all the witnesses in the prosecution case to my mind, was an honest witness. She saw various things from outside the Junee Bakery which is, as I understood her evidence, on the other side of Broadway Avenue from the Junee Motel.
	
	
	It should be pointed out that this particular street, at least in the vicinity of the Junee Motel, is a very wide street. It has a roadway adjacent to the bakery separated by a wide medium strip, that is a medium strip that appears to be well over 15 metres wide, and then another roadway leading on to the motel. This lady, Ms McNeair, made observations that were relied upon by counsel for the prisoner as purportedly supporting the prisoner’s version, given he says that he stabbed the victim on that median strip. Of this area there are some photographs tendered in the Court.
	
	
	From the outset, as I said, as the matter unfolded there appeared to be really no dispute on the part of the prisoner as to the circumstances of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm to the victim. The prisoner’s evidence concerning that matter in company with his brother, bearing in mind he pleaded guilty to being in company with his brother, raised, as I said, no substantial issue of dispute. At one point the prisoner in his evidence sought to describe this aspect of the conflict as some sort of “fight”. But he soon retreated from that proposition in his evidence and conceded, when asked to provide further particulars of what happened, that in fact it was no fight because the victim was entirely defenceless at that point of the proceedings. He had been set upon by the prisoner and his brother together at that point.
	
	
	When asked about Mr Moor’s account of what happened, particularly concerning statements heard by Mr Moor and observations Mr Moor made of the number of blows to the victim and the character of the blows and what was said to Mr Moor by the prisoner, the prisoner could only say, very unconvincingly, that he had no memory. Even if his statement was convincing, it does not assist him in any issue of disputed fact.
	
	
	Mr Moor was a very impressive witness to the extent that, firstly, he was adamant in his evidence. His statement to police was made on the day of relevant events, when events were fresh in his memory and he would appear to be a person unaffected by alcohol, unlike the prisoner. He was skilfully cross-examined by the prisoner’s counsel and was completely unshaken in relation to relevant matters. There was absolutely no reason, including the evidence of the prisoner, that arose either in submission or otherwise observed not to accept Mr Moor’s evidence.
	
	
	So far as the prisoner’s evidence is concerned one would need to approach his evidence, of course, with considerable circumspection. First of all, but not necessarily in order of importance, he conceded in the course of his evidence as to the circumstances of the stabbing and that in placing his brother some distance away from that he gives this evidence in the knowledge that his brother was pleading not guilty to the same charge and was alleged to be part of a joint criminal enterprise in relation to the stabbing. He also understood that the presence or not of his brother at the site of the stabbing was a significant matter in the Crown case against his brother.
	
	
	I also assess his evidence in the knowledge, as I have pointed out, that when interviewed by police in relation to the matter three or four days after the event he denied wrongdoing, provided no assistance to the police, and in circumstances where, as I said, in his evidence he now claims the weapon he used was thrown down the drain outside the Junee Motel. It may well be there, of course, but nobody has bothered to go and find it for us. In the intervening period of time even since pleading guilty he has not, as I said earlier, provided any information to the prosecution about this matter.
	
	
	He was, it must be said and I do not mean this unkindly of him, a most unimpressive witness. I accept he has probably never given evidence before and he is the prisoner. He is under a great deal of pressure. I understand all of those matters. Any key admissions or details of his actions were very reluctantly given, such as, for example, his assertion that after he had stabbed the victim and followed him down to outside the hotel. He initially claimed that they were involved in “a fight”, which involved no resistance from the victim.
	
	
	The only part of the prisoner’s evidence I could accept without reservation is really quite distinct from the disputed facts. That is that he felt sorry for himself and the consequences for him and his family in relation to this matter. I understand why that would be so. His lack of memory of key events such as the details of Mr Moor’s interaction with the attackers, to my mind, reflects adversely upon his claimed memory of other events.
	
	
	I have had regard to Dr Langcake’s evidence and the detail of matters arising in cross-examination particularly, and in my view, having regard to her opinion in the context of other facts, including the absence of any blood trail in circumstances where one might have thought it might not be washed away by the rain and particularly the doctor’s opinion that it was unlikely that the victim could have moved such a distance in the manner reflected, for example, by the CCTV footage. There is no reasonable possibility by regard to her evidence that the victim was stabbed some hundreds of metres away from the Junee Hotel and then stumbled or ran or walked back to the Junee Hotel from the scene of the stabbing as asserted by the prisoner.
	
	
	The evidence of Ms McNeair, the lady at the bakery, reflects upon the movement of two or three men at various times in the area outside the Junee Motel and in the medium strip and then along the Broadway Street precinct, heading in the direction of the Junee Hotel. At one point she suggested one of the men had gone into a nearby building. Her account is just as consistent with three men being together at various times either arguing and/or fighting, before the victim was chased or followed back to the Junee Hotel without having been stabbed, as suggested as the scenario by the prisoner.
	
	
	A most compelling piece of evidence, apart from the weight of the expert opinion in conjunction with the physical evidence, is the evidence of Mr Moor. Of particular importance were the words said by the prisoner, “Come down here and I’ll stab you too.” I appreciate that that could refer to the fact of an earlier stabbing, as claimed by the prisoner. But in my view in the context of all of the other evidence it is more consistent with a reaction by the prisoner almost immediately after the stabbing of the victim, at a time when the prisoner was in possession of the knife. It is to be remembered that the prisoner’s account is that he had discarded the knife before he chased the victim down the road. The statement made to Mr Moor that he would “ ... stab him too” speaks of him having a knife in his possession at that particular time.
	
	
	His counsel in submission, of course, conceded the difficulties faced by the explanation given by the prisoner. In fairness to her and her skill in conducting her client’s case, she said, amongst other things, effectively “It is what it is”. She had her instructions to put his case and challenge the facts asserted by the Crown, and I respect that. She did that skilfully and the prisoner had the right to give evidence of what he believed to be the circumstances in which events occurred.
	
	
	These are matters of right and I will draw no inference adverse to him for exercising his rights. But the truth of the matter, if reality was understood by the prisoner, is that he must have understood it would be very, very difficult indeed for any Court to accept an account of a person who was so heavily intoxicated seeking to challenge the matters that the Crown said had been proved in part by independent evidence.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of the butterknife, of course the significance of him going to grab a butterknife, as I would understand it, is that he was not armed with a weapon that was capable of inflicting great harm and that the weapon that he in fact used upon the victim in the course of a heated argument, which I accept had occurred, was not premeditated or was thought out. I have referred to the expert opinion of Dr Langcake. It is clear on any view of it, in the context of the expert evidence, that for a relatively blunt object like a butterknife to penetrate the chest wall in the manner in which this wound did would require tremendous force. To my mind a type of concentrated force entirely inconsistent with what the offender claimed to be his use of the knife, in a form of self-defence fighting this person by himself. It is in this context I have formed the view that the offender’s evidence about his account is a situation of ‘confess and avoid’, if that is the correct expression. I bear in mind, of course, that he claims he was so intoxicated he cannot remember what he said to Mr Moor and other relevant events. I am quite satisfied that the preponderance of independent evidence and expert evidence and physical evidence is contrary to the unsatisfactory explanation given by the offender.
	
	
	I have referred to Mr Richards and Mr Fitzgerald. Their evidence does not really add to the more direct evidence of Mr Moor or the account given by the offender. One aspect of Mr Fitzgerald’s evidence however that is against the offender is that he suggests in his evidence that there was some argument or some confrontation going on outside the Junee Hotel for a matter of some minutes before the fighting that he saw occurred. It would be highly unlikely, one would have thought, that the victim having been stabbed several hundred metres away staggered back to the hotel, lent against a car or a vehicle of some type and then engaged in some sort of debate or argument with his two attackers with that stab wound in his chest.
	
	
	I have already dealt with the evidence of the two young women who found their way back to the Junee Motel as I said. The evidence of one of those women reflects upon the belligerence of the offender after the event, and certainly shows in the immediate aftermath the offender at least was neither furtive nor contrite.
	
	
	Having made all these various findings and observations about the evidence, there are other conclusions that need to be noted for the purposes of assessing the objective facts. Firstly, this was not a planned crime or a premeditated crime in the generally accepted understanding of that word. I am referring of course to the wounding with intent matter at the moment. The assault occasioning actual bodily harm matter was not premeditated nor planned as well. But neither crime was “impulsive”. Firstly, this is not a case of a man being stabbed and then assaulted immediately upon an insult or some physical altercation between the offender and the victim. The offender’s own account is that he went into a room to get a knife and introduced it into an argument where the victim was unarmed. As the Crown facts stated, and the facts I accept establish, the offender and his brother followed the victim for some distance after their heated argument and the offender armed with a knife. Thus, whilst I have made a finding of no “premeditation”, it is clear the offender was prepared to confront the victim with the knife in his possession in circumstances where ultimately he had no concern about using it.
	
	
	The grabbing of the knife however I am prepared to accept was very much in the heat of the moment. I have accepted that there was a heated argument between the offender and the victim and the offender’s brother. The background to it may well have been some discord in respect of their working relationship and I am mindful of the evidence of the publican that the supervisor wanted to fight the offender at some stage. That having been said, the CCTV footage of the group going back to the Junee Motel shows the group seeming to be walking along in a relatively relaxed manner and it would appear that the argument that later developed arose out of past enmities.
	
	
	I conclude that the Crown has not established beyond reasonable doubt that the cause of the disputation between the offender and the victim was “not unprovoked”. In other words, what commenced this course of violence was some dispute, it could have even been a form of physical altercation, the victim cannot remember, which might have been in part contributed to by the action of the victim. But having said that, the subsequent events occurring some distance from the start of that altercation reflect upon the diminishing mitigation of any actions on the part of the victim toward the offender. The physical altercation at the motel, if it was one but certainly the argument, does not justify or explain the stabbing of the victim and certainly does not explain the cowardly attack upon him by kicking when he was defenceless on the ground. As I said, the victim was not armed and it is quite clear from Mr Moor’s evidence he was quite incapable of defending himself.
	
	
	I bear in mind of course that the stabbing of the victim occurred when the offender was in the company of his brother, which is an aggravating factor, bearing in mind it is not pleaded, pursuant to s 21A (2)(e) as submitted by the learned Crown Prosecutor. In any event putting aside the issue of any aggravating factor that might be pleaded or otherwise arising under s 21A of the Act, the victim was at all relevant times outnumbered and, of course, then assaulted after the stabbing. The assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company, which whilst it did not cause more serious injury to the victim was in one sense even more reprehensible than the stabbing.
	
	
	The offender’s criminal history is not significant in my view. I am mindful of the fact he has a finding of guilt in 2009 for an offence committed in 2010 at the Nowra Children’s Court. The offender was born in November 1990 and thus the offence of affray and the offence or robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon were offences committed when 17. He was ordered to serve control orders that were suspended. The affray matter of course has the characteristics of the current matter, but it is to be said for a person who is still relatively young those offences were some distance from the events with which I am concerned in time. He has other findings of guilt of a minor matter relating to the misuse of motor vehicles and a finding of guilt in 2012 for wilful damage in Queensland, for which there was no conviction. For the purposes of s 21A(3) of the Act, I am prepared to find that he does not have a significant criminal history, as I have said.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence about his personal circumstances before me. Notwithstanding the fact I have rejected his account of the stabbing, I am prepared to accept aspects of the evidence that he gave. Firstly, he is in partnership with a woman with whom he has had a relationship for some three or four years. She already had a five year old son. She leads a “pro-social lifestyle” and it is quite clear on the evidence the offender was a hard working man, who was obviously trying to do the best for his family by going out to Junee to work on the railway.
	
	
	He has had limited education, only attending two years of high school, but as I would understand it he has generally been employed. He has undertaken some courses at TAFE to improve himself and obtained some certificates at various places to try and improve his employment opportunities. Since this incident he has apparently lost his employment with the rail maintenance firm. He worked at a chaff mill for a period of time and also worked at some form of commercial hardware premises.
	
	
	I accept the fact that he would wish to return to his partner and maintain that relationship which will be a positive influence on him. He is a member of a large family, as I would understand it. There is some dysfunction in his family. His mother and father separated when he was relatively young. He has four older sisters and an older brother and the younger brother, his co-offender, as well.
	
	
	I accept that the offender, whilst he has used drugs in the past, was not a person who was abusing prohibited drugs at the relevant time nor has a problem with those as such. But he was a heavy drinker, drinking in a “binge fashion”, not only on the night of the commission of the offence but at other times either side of the offending. His binge drinking no doubt has contributed to his loss of control on this particular night.
	
	
	He was subjected to various psychological tests, including an intelligence test and assessment of his depression, anxiety and stress, severity of substance dependence and a personality assessment. The conclusion reached by the psychologist in relation to the matter, noting the background of the offender and his then current circumstances, was that his overall cognitive functioning fell on the cusp between lower extreme and low average range. He also suffered from the symptoms of a “substance dependence disorder” in relation to alcohol at the time of the offence. He has a low tolerance it would seem for frustration, particularly when affected by alcohol, and a low capacity to problem solve when confronted with stressful situations.
	
	
	So far as recidivism is concerned, he is found to be in the “moderate to high risk of re-offending”, having regard to some of his past misconduct and antisocial associates and other matters I have not referred to, but the report notes some ‘conduct disorder’ situations at his high school that have ultimately led to him terminating his secondary education. With regard to his risk of recidivism it is largely reflected by what there is of his criminal history and his past conduct problems.
	
	
	He is also to be found to be suffering from symptoms of mildly elevated depression. It would seem that those matters arising out of the testing are reactive to his current circumstances of being in custody for the first time.
	
	
	He should undertake a violence offender’s treatment program whilst in custody, which is self-evidently so. He also should undertake some form of anger management program at some stage and he needs to receive professional assistance in relation to substance abuse, particularly his abuse or alcohol. I do not think there is any doubt, of course it goes without saying, if he and his workmates had come home from a hard day working on the railways had a cup of tea, went to the movies and went back to the motel none of this unfortunate affair for the victim would have occurred.
	
	
	There was not much other material available to me in relation to the subjective circumstances of the offender. I accept the fact that he does continue to have the support of his partner and his family.
	
	
	In sentencing the offender I have had regard of course to s 3A of the Act. The purposes of sentencing of course loom very large in a sentencing exercise such as this. I believe that the offending of the offender, whilst I do not doubt that he is capable of reacting with violence in a particular situation, is primarily “uncharacteristic” in the sense that the offender is not a person prone to use weapons to settle arguments. That having been said, of course the facts of the matter are that the offence that he committed was a serious offence for its effect upon the victim. The circumstances of drunken people fighting in the streets and causing serious injury to one another is one that has been the subject of considerable debate amongst the community. The Courts and the community are sick and tired of having to clean up the mess caused by drunken or intoxicated people causing serious injury to others, and the conduct of the offender of course was ultimately inexcusable.
	
	
	There is a need for the offender to be adequately punished. There is a need for an element of general deterrence of course in this type of offending and some element of deterring this offender. Having regard however to his “pro-social” domestic circumstances, the absence of any significant criminal history and his industry, I am prepared to accept that the weight to be given to protection of the community from the offender is very little indeed. Of course, if a person acts this way once they can act this way again. I do not believe the offender is a risk to the community at large by reason of having a generally violent disposition.
	
	
	I am required to make him accountable and denounce his conduct and recognise of course the serious harm done to the victim, but I am also required to promote his rehabilitation. In that regard I adopt, if I may do so with humility, the observations of King CJ in the decision of Yardley v Betts, also adopted by then Wood CJ at CL in R v Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA. King CJ in 1978 observed that:
	


“The protection of the community included a consideration of the rehabilitation of offenders because if offenders were rehabilitated or assisted in their rehabilitation then ultimately this was a matter that protected the community in the future.”


	
	Section 5 of the Act has been taken into account but it is quite clear that nothing other than a term of imprisonment can be imposed.
	
	
	I have referred to the aggravating factors submitted by the Crown, the fact that the wounding with intent was committed in company. Of course that is an element of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence and thus cannot be taken into account as an aggravating factor additional to that matter arising from the pleadings. A court is not to have additional regard to any aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence as s 21A(2) makes clear. I appreciate the injury caused was substantial but it is an element of the offence that the offender inflicted grievous bodily harm. Once again the use of a weapon is not itself an additional aggravating factor given the elements of the offence. It is inherent in the offending one would have thought that the offender would have used a weapon.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors that arise the offence, as I said, was not part of planned or organised criminal activity. The offending itself was not caused by provocation by the victim, I have made that clear, but the train of events started by matters not entirely the fault of the offender. In fact I noted one of the young women from the hotel referred to the victim being a bit “lippy” towards the offender back at the hotel. But that was some hours of course before the stabbing of the victim, at least more than an hour and a half before that occurred.
	
	
	The offender does not have a significant record of previous convictions. I could not conclude ultimately the offender was a person of good character, but I am prepared to accept, notwithstanding the offender’s obstinacy in the fact finding exercise, that other features of the matter suggest that he is unlikely to re-offend, particularly with the salutary experience of a sentence of imprisonment. I am prepared to accept through the fact that he is a young man of industry that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	His counsel urged upon me to conclude that the prisoner had shown remorse. I could not conclude on balance that that was so. I do not believe that he has accepted responsibility for his actions. Whilst he acknowledges the injury and loss and damage that he has caused this has come at a much later time than would be salient to an assessment of remorse.
	
	
	He has expressed remorse for his actions, I understand that. He appears to me and to the Community Corrections Service to be more remorseful about his circumstances than those of the victim. There are no other mitigating factors that arise.
	
	
	With regard to the sentencing for the two offences I am required to have regard to the principal of ‘totality’. I am mindful of what is said about this matter by the majority of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly at [45] and discussion of that judgment in later judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal, particularly the observations for example of Justice Simpson in the decision of Hammoud 2002.
	
	
	It seems to me, with respect, that whilst the two offences are closely related the attack upon the victim giving rise to the assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company, apart from being totally unnecessary, has to be seen as increasing the totality of the criminality. I am mindful of the fact that the victim was defenceless and even though the prisoner was highly intoxicated as I have said earlier the conduct of the prisoner was reprehensible.
	
	
	I have concluded that should be a finding of ‘special circumstances’ pursuant to s 44 of the Act. The partial accumulation of sentences requires a consideration of special circumstances in accordance with authority dating back to the old Sentencing Act, such as Astill, but also in my view there is a need for an extended period of supervision.
	
	
	I considered whether a period of four years was too much in the scheme of things. I must have regard to the relationship of the non-parole period to the total sentence and it seems to me that the prisoner will need an extended period of supervision to adjust to community living. He will need professional assistance in relation to employment in relation to re-establishing his relationship with his partner.
	
	
	He will also need a great deal of guidance in relation to anger management and the abuse or use of alcohol particularly. One would hope that this experience in gaol will not drive him back to experimentation with prohibited substances.
	
	
	That as I have addressed in my remarks on sentence matters that were either directly raised by the parties or had to be identified by myself and the consideration of what the appropriate sentence would be by regard to relevant principals and statutory considerations. I have certainly taken into account all the submissions that have been put to me by the parties in respect of the disputed facts and the other issues that are obviously relevant to sentencing.
	
	
	Just one last issue. It was never put nor could it be concluded by the Court, that anything arising out of the psychologist report gave rise to a consideration of matters that have been discussed in judgments such as De La Rosa (from 2010) or Hemsley (from 2004) and the many authorities to which those two judgments make reference. The prisoner does not suffer from any mental disorder or disability at all and there is nothing being demonstrated on the evidence to show a causal connection with any such matter to the offending.
	
	
	I am sorry, Mr Green, that is a lot of territory to cover I’m afraid. Could you stand up? Thanks very much.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company you are convicted. You are sentenced to two years imprisonment. That will date from 3 August 2015. That sentence will expire on 2 August 2017.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, taking into account the matter on the Form 1 you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by non parole period of three years. That will date from 3 August 2016. It will expire on 2 August 2019. In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of four years imprisonment that will expire on 2 August 2023.
	
	
	Just take a seat, sir. I am sorry, Mr Green, there are two matters that I was to refer to and which for reasons that fall to me I neglected to refer to but they are important.
	
	
	Firstly, your counsel provided me with statistics in relation to the matter to which I have had regard. They provide me with a range of sentences imposed in the ‘higher courts’. The sample of cases setting out total sentences for the principal offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm is 138 and I have taken that into account.
	
	
	Of course the limitations of statistics were the subject of comment in 1998 by Chief Justice Spigelman in the decision of Bloomfield. His Honour’s observations were concerned with the limitations of statistics on appeal but many of those observations are relevant here and whilst the statistics provide a range of sentences imposed over a period of time and the incidence of particular sentences being imposed, without facts, without the character of the injury, the circumstances of the imposition of the injury, without details as to if pleas of guilty have been entered, and the like, what discounts have been given.
	
	
	The statistics provide little assistance of course in your case when sentencing you. I cannot give you any discount other than the discount I have accorded for the plea of guilty of 10% upon the other appropriate sentence, which led me to the conclusion that your total sentence for the principal offence should be seven years imprisonment, and the sentence for the assault occasioning actually bodily harm matter should be two years imprisonment.
	
	
	I am mindful of the timing of the plea and in fixing that discount it seemed to me, on the basis of the submissions agreed, that the discount should be 10% by regard to the discretion available to the court pursuant to the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton.
	
	
	The other matter I am afraid I did not refer to, and I apologise for that for keeping you, is of course the relevance of the standard non-parole period. In that regard I make note of the observations of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] 244 CLR 120 but of course particularly the legislative amendments occurring subsequently in the now detailed provisions in s 54A(2) and s 54B(2) of the Act.
	
	
	In relation to s 54A(2) the standard non-parole period represents the non parole period for an offence of the middle range of objective seriousness in the table of the division, only taking into account the objective factors effecting the relative seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	I conclude that this offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness. The absence of premeditation in the strict sense, the absence of planning, and the context in which the offending occurred is quite critical in coming to that conclusion. Furthermore pursuant to s 54B(2) the matters to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence, and particularly the non-parole period, by reference to the Table of the division do not include matters which are otherwise required to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence, such as mitigating factors and of course determination of whether there are “special circumstances” pursuant to s 44 of the Act.
	
	
	I am mindful that the learned Chief Justice in a decision of Way in the Court of Criminal Appeal from 2004 expressed the view that the middle range of objective circumstances was a “not necessarily narrow band”. Whether that observation, being an obiter observation, still stands after Muldrock nobody has really explained. It seemed to be in the circumstances ultimately, notwithstanding the fact that I found the offence to be in the middle range of objective circumstances, that I should adjust the non-parole period to take into account those matters that I have found in mitigation as well as the finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	I should point out I noted to make those observations prior to making the orders relevant to the prisoner but for some reason the circumstances in which I have got a great number of documents in front of me, my notes in relation to those matters were temporarily mislaid.
	
	
	Mr Green, do you understand the sentence I have imposed?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yeah, sort of.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: The total sentence I have imposed is eight years imprisonment and I’ve fixed a non-parole period of four years. I’ve backdated the total sentence to 3 August 2015. I have taken into account all the time you’ve spent in custody. You’ll be eligible to release to parole on 2 August 2019. That will be a matter for the Parole Authority. You won’t automatically be released to parole if the Parole Authority decides that you shouldn’t be released to parole. So at the end of the day your performance in custody will be relevant to the issue of when you’re released to parole. Of course all the orders I’ve made are subject to your rights of appeal and the Crown’s rights of appeal, I fully appreciate that, but I’m speaking in terms of the orders that I’ve made, do you understand that?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: If you are released to parole after four years you’ll be subject to parole supervision for another four years. You’ve never been on parole before although you’ve had a suspended control order. That will mean that at least for three of those four years you’ll have to report to an officer of the Community Corrections Service. If you don’t abide by the conditions of your parole the Parole Authority can revoke your parole. They won’t come to me to ask me to do that, or the Court of Criminal Appeal, or wherever your sentence finally ends, it’ll be a matter for the Parole Authority and the Parole Authority can revoke your parole, you’ll go back into custody, and you’ll stay in custody until the Parole Authority decides either that you be released or your total sentence expires. But your balance of sentence does run from the time you’re released from custody, do you understand that? So if you spent two years out in the community and they revoke your parole you wouldn’t start the balance of parole over again, it would be the balance of that time two years - the balance of your sentence less the two years you’d been in the community.
	
	
	So in other words you get credit for being “on the street” so to speak but when you are released to parole I’d hope that you wouldn’t commit any further offences or you wouldn’t have your parole revoked. I must say, if I haven’t said so already, if you commit more crimes whilst you’re on parole your parole can be revoked depending upon the character of the crime. I doubt that you’d be - have your parole revoked for driving unlicensed but if you went and assaulted somebody in a pub the likelihood is that your parole would be revoked and you’d stay in custody until the Parole Authority thought that it was proper that you be released, do you understand that?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I can’t explain it any better, I apologise for that, but as I said the matter of parole supervision is not for me, it’s a matter for the Parole Authority. Thank you very much, Mr Green, you’re excused.

		10 December 2015",2015-12-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768387,Woods v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (No 1) [2015] NSWCA 398,"Judgment


	
	JUDGMENT of THE COURT delivered by BASTEN JA: On 21 March 2013 the applicant, Andrew Keith Woods, was convicted of three offences under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) at Burwood Local Court. The offences arose out of his possession of cannabis leaf and plants. The applicant was sentenced by Magistrate Maloney to three concurrent good behaviour bonds, each for a period of 18 months, pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	The applicant exercised his right of appeal, challenging the convictions in the District Court. [1]  On 2 October 2013 Hanley DCJ, with the consent of the prosecutor, allowed the appeal in respect of one count which was held to overlap with other counts but otherwise dismissed the appeal. There is no right of appeal from such a judgment of the District Court. Furthermore, an adjudication of the District Court on appeal from the Local Court is not to be removed by any order into the Supreme Court. [2]  This provision limits the exercise of the Court’s supervisory jurisdiction pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) to cases involving jurisdictional error on the part of the District Court.  [3] 
	
	
	The convictions involved charges of supply of a prohibited drug and possession of a prohibited drug, namely cannabis leaf. The Local Court accepted the prosecution evidence that the applicant had in his possession 1,113.92 grams of that drug. By s 3 and Sch 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act a trafficable quantity of cannabis leaf is 300 grams. By s 29 possession of not less than a trafficable quantity is deemed to be possession for supply unless the person in possession of the drug proves the possession is otherwise than for supply (or other presently irrelevant circumstances). By s 3 supply is constituted by, amongst other things, possession for supply.
	
	
	On 27 February 2014, the applicant filed a summons in this Court purporting to assert a denial of procedural fairness which, it was said, was achieved by the primary judge through his “deliberate refusal to acknowledge the fact that the prima facie evidence used to convict had been falsified even after being presented with overwhelming evidence to support the fact that it is a forgery.” At one level, this ground appeared to be no more than an extravagantly expressed statement to the effect that the judge had made findings of fact on disputed evidence, which was said to be erroneous. If that were the correct understanding, the ground would not allege a breach of procedural fairness. An alternative understanding may be that the primary judge failed to address a defence raised by the applicant in the proceedings before him. Assuming that the defence was tenable and based on credible evidence, such an allegation might constitute a constructive failure to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on the Court.
	
	
	The submissions accompanying the summons ran to some 150 pages. They were in part argumentative and in part a detailed factual analysis of the events giving rise to the charges and the proceedings in the court below. The document also contained lengthy extracts from cases, some of which had potential relevance to the issues which were identified in the grounds, but which were not related to the material before the Court in any useful fashion. Other parts of this lengthy handwritten document contained material which was of no direct relevance to the case before the primary judge. The document failed to identify any comprehensible basis upon which it was said that the primary judge erred in the exercise of his function in determining the appeal. In the absence of such a clear and precise statement of error it is not the function of this Court to sift through the vast number of documents provided by the applicant to determine whether error can be identified.
	
	
	The original charge arose out of events on 7 September 2011, when a van being driven by the applicant was stopped by police. The evidence before the District Court was that after he was pulled over, the applicant was told that the vehicle would be searched and he was invited to stay. Not being under arrest, he declined to stay and left the scene on foot. The vehicle was then searched and cannabis found in a storage box in the van.
	
	
	Telephone intercepts revealed the applicant calling someone shortly after the van was seized and telling the person that the police had confiscated his car and that it was “full of drugs and everything.”
	
	
	It was accepted by the primary judge that the vehicle was stopped because police were investigating another matter and sought to carry out forensic testing on the vehicle.
	
	
	Hanley DCJ noted that the various officers involved in the stop and seizure and the experts involved in the examination of the cannabis and identification of the DNA found on gloves contained in the vehicle were cross-examined by the applicant. The judge continued:
	


“However, I note all the certificates in relation to the cannabis, DNA and plants and the documents identifying the continuity of those items were tendered without objection. It was not put in cross-examination to the officers who asserted finding the drugs in the van that they were not there or that they had not found them.”


	
	The District Court judge accepted the evidence for the prosecution as sufficient to warrant the conviction of the applicant. The appeal was therefore dismissed. No challenge to the factual findings made in the District Court is available in this Court. The transcript of the hearing before the District Court and the reasons for judgment reveal no relevant error. The summons should be dismissed. The Director did not seek costs.

		11 December 2015",2015-12-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2768400,Application by Ali Hussein pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 1855,"Judgment


	
	This is an application by Ali Hussein pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“the Act”) for referral of his case to the Court of Criminal Appeal (CCA) to be dealt with as an appeal against sentence, pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Act.
	
	
	On 31 January 2013 the applicant was sentenced by Murrell SC DCJ (as her Honour then was) in relation to eight offences, of which the applicant had earlier been found guilty by a jury. He subsequently lodged an appeal against his conviction with respect to three of the eight offences, being counts 4, 7, and 8, and against the sentences imposed relevant to all offences.
	
	
	On 17 April 2014 the CCA quashed the convictions entered with respect to counts 4, 7 and 8. Verdicts of acquittal were entered. The Court additionally quashed the sentences imposed upon the applicant with respect to counts 3 and 6, and the applicant was resentenced. The sentences imposed by the sentencing judge in respect of counts 1, 2 and 9 were confirmed.
	
	
	The overall sentence imposed by the CCA was one of 9 years imprisonment, made up of a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months commencing on 11 October 2011 and expiring on 10 April 2018, with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment commencing on 11 April 2018 and expiring on 10 October 2020: Manly v R; Hussein v R; Barghachoun v R [2014] NSWCCA 59.
	


Background of the Matter


	
	The offences of which the applicant was convicted arise out of a series of events on the evening of 19 August 2011 involving the applicant and three others, Ayman Manly (”Manly”), Imad Barghachoun (“Barghachoun”) and Andrew Riley (“Riley”). Following a four week trial in the District Court before Murrell SC DCJ the jury found the men guilty of various offences related to the events in 2011.
	
	
	The facts of the offences, in brief, are as follows.
	
	
	At about 9 pm on 19 August 2011, an unmarked Pantech truck left Bankstown with a cargo including mobile telephone handsets and foreign currency. The truck’s route was north along the Pacific Highway to Queensland.
	
	
	At about 9.05pm that evening, the applicant and Barghachoun entered a service station at Silverwater intending to steal a vehicle for use in the intended robbery of the Pantech truck. They wore “hoodie” tops that partially concealed their faces; the applicant also had a black and white scarf across his face.
	


Counts 1 and 2:


	
	The applicant approached the driver of an airport shuttle bus that had stopped to refuel. He asked the driver for the keys to the bus but the driver refused and ran to the safety of the service station building. The two offenders then approached the driver of a BMW vehicle that had also stopped for fuel and asked for the keys to that vehicle. Despite being told by one of the offenders that he had a gun, the driver did not hand over the keys to his car, and the applicant and Barghachoun ran from the service station empty handed. Manly had been waiting nearby in his dark blue Subaru WRX vehicle. The applicant, Hussein and Barghachoun got into Manly's vehicle, and Manly drove off.
	


Count 3:


	
	Manly drove to the Vittoria Coffee Warehouse a block or so away. A security officer was seated in a silver Mazda vehicle at the Warehouse entrance, waiting to be admitted to the premises. Manly stopped his vehicle behind that of the security officer and the applicant got out. He was armed with a Browning pistol. The applicant opened the door of the Mazda and cocked the pistol. When the security officer fled the applicant got into the Mazda and drove off. Manly and Barghachoun followed in the Subaru.
	
	
	The two vehicles were driven in convoy north to Bulahdelah, with Barghachoun joining the applicant in the stolen Mazda at some point, and the fourth of the offenders, Riley, joining the others during the drive.
	


Count 4:


	
	During the drive north a set of number plates were stolen from a vehicle parked at a service station, and subsequently attached to the stolen Mazda to disguise it (the applicant was acquitted of this charge by the CCA.)
	


Counts 6, 7 and 8:


	
	At about 11.30pm that night, at a location just north of Bulahdelah, the stolen Mazda overtook the Pantech truck and drove across its path, forcing it to stop. A shot was fired from the Browning pistol at the truck’s windscreen (count 7), an offence that the jury found the applicant had committed, but of which the CCA subsequently acquitted him. The driver was forced from the truck’s cabin at gunpoint by an armed offender, and initially he walked towards the rear of the truck. A further shot was fired, into the ground, and the driver was forced to the front of the truck.
	
	
	The truck driver was forced at gunpoint to kneel on the ground, with the armed offender pushing the pistol into the driver’s back to keep him in that position. When other motorists stopped near the truck further shots were fired into the ground (count 8), to dissuade the motorists from remaining in the area. The applicant was found guilty of discharging these shots by the jury on the basis that he had possession of and fired the gun, but he was acquitted on appeal.
	
	
	Two of the offenders took the truck and its contents from the driver, and drove north (count 6, being the aggravated robbery).
	


Count 10:


	
	Barghachoun and Riley drove the Pantech truck north for a short distance before turning off the Pacific Highway towards a waste depot. The driver inadvertently directed the truck into a roadside culvert where it became bogged, and the offenders were forced to abandon it. After a lengthy walk through bushland, south towards Bulahdelah, the offenders came to a sawmill, where they stole a bus belonging to the sawmill.
	
	
	The bus was driven towards Forster. At about 3 am on 20 August 2011, police arrested Barghachoun and Riley.
	


Count 9:


	
	At some point after the robbery of the truck, the stolen Mazda was set alight and destroyed.
	
	
	Shortly after the commission of these offence, and during the course of the night, the applicant and Manly were stopped and spoken to by police in Bulahdelah, and their details were obtained. They were allowed to leave. The applicant was not wearing camouflage pants when observed by police, a matter critical to the success of his later conviction appeal.

	The appellate proceedings followed.
	


The Proceedings in the CCA


	
	The applicant appealed against his conviction in respect of counts 4, 7, and 8, arguing that the convictions were unreasonable and unable to be supported by the evidence. The Court accepted that it was not open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the particular offences had in fact been committed by the applicant. Accordingly, the appeal against conviction was upheld and the convictions and sentences for these counts quashed.
	
	
	The Applicant also appealed against sentence, with the appeal relevant to the remaining counts upheld in part.
	
	
	At [113] of the principal judgment, Bellew J identified three factual matters relevant to sentence as determined by the sentencing judge:
	


“Hussein was the offender who took the most active role in relation to the various robberies (at ROS [30]);

The fact that the offending in count 3 involved (inter alia) extensive planning and was committed in company rendered it “significantly more serious” then the circumstances discussed in R v Henry (1996) 46 NSWLR 346 (at ROS [34]);

The value of the damage resulting from the offending in count 9 must have been considerable, although the evidence did not establish beyond reasonable doubt the identity of the offender who actually lit the fire (at ROS [37]).”


	
	His Honour was not able to agree with the conclusion of the sentencing judge that the applicant’s participation was “significantly” more serious than the circumstances in R v Henry (1996) 46 NSWLR 346; additionally observing  that the degree of planning could not be determined.
	
	
	Further error was found in the application of the principle of general deterrence, with the Court concluding that the applicant, a person suffering from a number of diagnosed psychiatric illnesses, including paranoid schizophrenia, was not an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence.
	
	
	The sentences imposed with respect to counts 3 and 6 were quashed, and the applicant was resentenced. For count 3, the armed robbery of the Mazda sedan, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 5 years, commencing on 11 October 2012 and expiring on 10 October 2017. For count 6, the aggravated robbery of the truck, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years imprisonment, commencing on 11 April 2014 and expiring on 10 April 2018, with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months, commencing on 11 April 2018 and expiring on 10 October 2020.
	
	
	The overall sentence was reduced to 9 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months.
	


Applications Under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW)


	
	The applicant now asks for his case to be referred to the CCA pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Act, contending that there appears to be a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in his case. Specifically, it is argued that the CCA did not independently re-exercise the sentencing discretion in that it failed to determine the role of the applicant in the crimes, particularly as compared to that of Barghachoun, or to make a proper assessment of the objective gravity of the offences.
	
	
	Although the applicant contends that the CCA fell into error in the re-sentencing exercise, there was no application pursuant to rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules to set aside or vary the order of the Court, and the applicant specifically disavows any intention to seek special leave to appeal to the High Court, even though that avenue is or was open. The applicant discounts the prospect of a special leave application at [60] of his written submissions, because of the “different and onerous considerations applicable to an application for special leave”.
	
	
	Consideration of an application pursuant to Part 7 of the Act is in the nature of an inquiry, with the Court performing an administrative rather than a judicial act: Application of Peter James Holland under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 per Johnson J at [5] referring to Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at [48]-[50]; Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] 214 CLR 318 at 362 [124].
	
	
	The relevant provisions from Part 7 of the Act are ss 78 and 79, which provide:
	


“78 Applications to Supreme Court 

(1)    An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.

(2)    The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must cause a copy of any application made under this section to be given to the Minister.”

79 Consideration of applications 

(1)    After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a)    the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or

(b)    the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(2)    Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

(3)    The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a)    it appears that the matter:

(i)    has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

(ii)    has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

(iii)    has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

(iv)    has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b)    the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.

(3A)    The Supreme Court may defer consideration of an application under section 78 if:

(a)    the time within which an appeal may be made against the conviction or sentence (including an application for leave to appeal) is yet to expire, or

(b)    the conviction or sentence is the subject of appeal proceedings (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) that are yet to be finally determined, or

(c)    the application fails to disclose sufficient information to enable the conviction or sentence to be properly considered.

(3B)    This section does not authorise a direction to be given, or a referral to be made to the Court of Criminal Appeal, if the Supreme Court is satisfied that the grounds for the direction or referral arise only from:

(a)    the fact that the convicted person was:

(i)    questioned under section 24 of the Crime Commission Act 2012 , or

(ii)    required under section 24 or 29 of that Act to produce a document or thing, or

(b)    either or both of the following:

(i)    evidence obtained directly from that questioning or requirement,

(ii)    any further information, evidence, document or thing obtained as a result of the questioning or the production of the document or thing.

(4)    Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.

(5)    The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).”


	
	The determination of an application of this nature involves the exercise of a discretionary power by a judge of the Supreme Court. There are three possible outcomes provided for by s 79, being:
	



	
	An order may be made directing that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or (relevantly in the current matter) sentence; or
	
	
	An order may be made referring “the whole case” to the Court of Criminal Appeal, where it would be dealt with pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW); or
	
	
	The Court may refuse to make either of those orders.
	



	
	An order for an inquiry (s 79(1)(a)), or to refer the case to the CCA (s 79(1)(b)), may only be made where s 79(2) of the Act is satisfied, that is, where it “appears” that (relevantly) there is a doubt or question as to “any mitigating circumstance in the case”.
	
	
	What could constitute a mitigating circumstance has been broadly construed, and includes error which may found a doubt or question as to some feature of the matter which would have led to the imposition of a less severe sentence than that in fact imposed: Sinkovich v Attorney General for the State of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383; (2013) 85 NSWLR 783; (2013) 238 A Crim R 3232, at [30] – [31], per Basten JA, with whom Bathurst CJ, Beazley P, Price and Beech-Jones JJ agreed).
	
	
	Section 79(3) of the Act provides a power for the Court to refuse to consider or otherwise deal with the application. Sections 79(3)(a) and 79(3)(b) set out some matters of relevance to any such refusal. Although the matters referred to are not intended to be exhaustive, they include circumstances where it appears to the Court that the matter was fully dealt with in the proceedings in question (s 79(3)(a)(i)); where a review has already been carried out (s 79(3)(a)(ii)); where there has been or is an available avenue of appeal but the applicant has not pursued that avenue (s 79(3)(a)(iii)); where an appeal was commenced but lapsed or was withdrawn (s 79(3)(a)(iv)); or where the Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or circumstances justifying action under the Act (s 79(3)(b)).
	
	
	A power to refuse to deal with an application is a necessary corollary to the powers the Court may exercise pursuant to s 79(1), to prevent persons who are merely unhappy with the outcome of their trial or sentence proceedings turning to a Part 7 application as an easier or less expensive alternative to appellate action, in circumstances where there is no bar to the number of times such an application may be made.
	
	
	Part 7 of the Act is remedial legislation; it is intended to provide a mechanism by which an individual may seek to address some material doubt as to the legitimacy of his or her conviction or sentence. As Basten JA said in Sinkovich (at [52]):
	


“History and statutory language demonstrate that the overriding purpose of Pt 7 is, consistently with the high value placed on freedom of the individual and the unwillingness to allow that liberty to be infringed because of commission of a criminal offence unless the offence has been established beyond reasonable doubt, to provide a means to address doubts as to compliance with these principles. Historically, the need for a mechanism to resolve doubts or questions as to the soundness of a conviction or sentence, so as to avoid an unremediable miscarriage of justice, called for statutory intervention.”


	
	Prior to the introduction of the statutory predecessor to Part 7 of the Act, that being in its original form s 383 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1883 (NSW), there was no formalised process for appeal against conviction or sentence (as that process is now understood), or for judicial or Executive review. The 1883 Act sought to formalise what had been an ad hoc and unauthorised process of judicial review, in circumstances where a doubt or question arose as to guilt or a mitigating circumstance: s 383. A more general right of appeal was not introduced in New South Wales until the passage in 1912 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). See Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] HCA 28; (2003) 214 CLR 318 for a full history of the legislative provisions.
	
	
	Whilst a statutory mechanism for review was retained subsequent to the introduction of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), now in the form of Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), those provisions are not intended to operate as a substitute for the appeals process provided by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). As Johnson J said in Application of Peter James Holland at [9]:
	


“The procedure under s.78 is not intended to provide a convicted

person with yet another avenue of appeal after the usual avenues have

been exhausted: Application of Dunn at [9]; Application of Milat [2005]

NSWSC 920; (2005) 157 A Crim R 565 at 574 [26]. Nor is it an

opportunity, in a sense, to run the trial again on paper, with the

ultimate submission that acquittal should result.”


	
	In the applicant’s case, he has made an application for review of the sentencing decision of the CCA in circumstances where he has or had an available avenue by which he could seek leave to appeal to the High Court, but has chosen not to take that course. There is nothing in the material filed in support of the applicant’s case to explain that choice, other than the reference in the applicant’s written submissions to the different and “more onerous” considerations that apply to special leave applications.
	
	
	In effect, the applicant’s s 78 application raises what is contended to be an error of law, and asks a single judge of this Court to review the decision of three judges of the Court sitting as the Court of Criminal Appeal, to determine whether there appears to be a doubt or question (ultimately) about the sentence imposed.
	
	
	That background to the application does not necessarily militate in favour of exercising the discretion conferred by s 79(1) as the applicant asks, particularly bearing in mind the requirement generally to determine such applications “responsibly and no doubt sparingly”: Sinkovich at [53]. That is particularly so where the applicant has chosen not to pursue an available avenue of appeal, apparently because a s 78 application is perceived as less onerous than appellate proceedings.
	
	
	Whilst Part 7 gives this Court the power to refer the matter to the CCA, and the applicant submits that such an order should be made, it can only be made where the Court concludes that there is a ""doubt or question"" as to any mitigating circumstances in the applicant’s case.
	
	
	The applicant’s principal complaint is that, having found that the assessment of the objective gravity of the offences made by the sentencing judge was in error, the CCA then failed to make an assessment of its own, and failed to give effect to the conclusion that general deterrence had no role to play in the determination of sentence.
	
	
	It is argued that the sentences ultimately imposed by the Court do not reflect either the significant diminution in the gravity of the applicant’s crimes which necessarily flows from the conclusions of the Court, or the absence of any role for general deterrence in the sentence imposed. Because of those asserted errors it is contended that the CCA failed to independently exercise the sentencing discretion, and thus there appears to be a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance, leading to the possibility that a lesser sentence than that imposed is warranted.
	
	
	The Attorney General, who has filed written submissions which may be considered on the application pursuant to s 79(4) of the Act, submits that none of the matters raised by the applicant constitute errors in the exercise of the CCA’s sentencing discretion such that this Court would be satisfied that there appears to be a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in the applicant’s case. It is submitted that there is no possibility that the CCA imposed a more severe sentence than it should properly have imposed.
	
	
	Having carefully considered the judgment of the CCA, and the submissions of the applicant and the Attorney, I am unpersuaded that there are matters in the judgment which suggest or demonstrate that the exercise of the sentencing discretion miscarried, giving rise to the appearance of a doubt or question.
	
	
	I do not agree that there was a failure in the principal judgment to assess the gravity of the applicant’s crimes. Whilst the CCA did not categorise the objective gravity of the applicant’s crimes by reference to a scale or some mathematical analogy, that is not required: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44, at [45] to [47] per Johnson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed: PK v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 263.
	
	
	What is required when a sentence is determined according to a process of instinctive synthesis is to identify all of the factors that are relevant to sentence and then make a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence in all the circumstances of the case: Zreika v R; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 377-378 [51]; Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [26].
	
	
	In the principal judgment the CCA considered those aspects of the matter which went to the objective gravity of the offence, including the number of individuals involved and the actions of each participant in the enterprise, the fact that there was a degree of planning, the use of a firearm (albeit in circumstances where the applicant could not be held personally responsible for the possession and discharge of the weapon), and so on. Although some aspects of the sentencing decision at first instance were concluded to be erroneous, others were not, and those aspects of the matter were referred to by the CCA. Additionally, Bellew J concluded at [119] that the level of criminality for count 3 was “similar in many respects” to that in R v Henry (1996) 46 NSWLR 346, a clear indication of the assessment of the CCA of the gravity of that offence.
	
	
	Reading the judgment as a whole, and having regard to the sentences imposed on Barghachoun, I am not left with a sense of doubt or any question as to this aspect of the sentence that was imposed upon the applicant.
	
	
	Nor is there any basis upon which to question the way in which the CCA approached the issue of general deterrence. The CCA’s conclusion that the applicant was an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence was clearly enunciated and, having regard to the sentence ultimately imposed, must have been given full effect in my view. The sentences imposed by the CCA were, having regard to the very serious nature of the applicant’s crimes, committed in the context of a joint criminal enterprise, relatively modest. They do not of themselves, or by comparison with the sentences imposed upon the co-offender, suggest that the CCA overlooked its own conclusion that general deterrence had no real role to play in the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	Having considered the matter I am not satisfied that the “gateway” provisions of s 79(2) of the Act have been met. Accordingly, I decline to make an order pursuant to s 79(1) of the Act.

2768411,Obeid v R [2015] NSWCCA 309,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

Mr Edward Moses Obeid was formerly a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales. On 8 May 2015 he was arraigned on an indictment charging him with one count of wilfully misconducting himself in public office. Mr Obeid pleaded not guilty to the charge. However, by notice of motion dated 9 September 2015 he applied for the indictment to be set aside, stayed or quashed.

The primary judge dismissed the application, and declined to certify that the judgment was one appropriate for determination on appeal. Accordingly, Mr Obeid sought leave to appeal under s 5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The Crown did not oppose leave being granted and argument proceeded on the basis that there would be a grant of leave.

The issues arising on appeal were: (a) whether the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the charge, or whether the matter is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Legislative Council; (b) whether a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council is a “public officer” for the purposes of the offence; (c) whether the indictment should be stayed because parliamentary privilege will prevent the misconduct being proved; (d) whether the indictment is bad for extending the charge to conduct “connected to” Mr Obeid’s office; and (e) whether the primary judge erred in formulating the duty owed by Mr Obeid.

Held by Bathurst CJ, Beazley P and Leeming JA, dismissing the appeal:

First issue: jurisdiction 

1.   The “first duty” of a court is to determine whether it has jurisdiction, and it is difficult to envisage situations where the question of jurisdiction should be deferred, especially if jurisdiction is contested: at [9].

Federated Engine-Drivers and Firemen’s Association of Australasia v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (1911) 12 CLR 398, applied
Zhang v Zemin [2010] NSWCA 255; 79 NSWLR 513; CSL Australia Pty Ltd v Formosa [2009] NSWCA 363; 261 ALR 441; Eberstaller v Poulos [2014] NSWCA 211; 87 NSWLR 394, considered

2.   The test for determining whether a court lacks jurisdiction is different from the test for determining whether a parliamentary chamber has a power or privilege: at [19].

3.   Members of Parliament are subject to the ordinary criminal jurisdiction of the courts, including the Supreme Court: at [20].

4.   It is not appropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words: at [22].

The Owners of the Ship “Shin Kobe Maru” v Empire Shipping Co Inc (1994) 181 CLR 404; Rost v Edwards [1990] 2 QB 460, applied

5.   Any exclusive jurisdiction on the part of the Parliament or one of its chambers is subject to statute: at [23].

Arena v Nader (1997) 42 NSWLR 427, referred to

6.   The Supreme Court did not lack subject-matter jurisdiction in respect of the charge against Mr Obeid: at [35]-[52].

Constitution Act 1902 (NSW), ss 13A, 14A; R v Chaytor [2010] UKSC 52; [2011] 1 AC 684; R v Richards; Ex parte Fitzpatrick and Browne (1955) 92 CLR 157, considered

Second issue: public officer

7.   A member of the Legislative Council is a public officer to whom the common law offence of wilful misconduct in public office extends: at [119]-[123].

R v Bembridge (1783) 3 Dougl 327; 99 ER 679; 22 St Tr 1; R v Boston (1923) 33 CLR 386; R v White (1875) 13 SCR (NSW) (L) 322; R v Greenway [1998] Public Law 357; Sneddon v State of New South Wales [2012] NSWCA 351; C Nicholls QC, T Daniel, M Polaine, J Hatchard, Corruption and Misuse of Public Office (2nd ed, 2011, Oxford University Press); G Zellick, “Bribery of Members of Parliament and the Criminal Law” [1979] Public Law 31, Constitution Act 1902 (NSW), s 12, considered and applied

Third issue: parliamentary privilege

8.   A distinction must be drawn between the function of a member of the Legislative Council in communicating with the Executive and its employees on the one hand, and whether a particular communication has the requisite nexus with proceedings in Parliament on the other: at [129]-[130].

9.   There was nothing to suggest that the particular communication relied upon in the indictment had any connection to parliamentary proceedings, such that it would be protected by parliamentary privilege (including by art 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689 (1 Will & Mar sess 2 c 2)): at [129]-[130].

Fourth issue: conduct “connected to” office

10.   The words “or connected to” in the indictment adhere to the second element of the common law offence of wilful misconduct in public office as set out in R v Quach [2010] VSCA 106; 201 A Crim R 522 at [46]: at [131]-[132].

11.   In order to depart from a decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal, the New South Wales Court of Appeal must be convinced that the relevant decision is “plainly wrong”: at [136].

Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; 230 CLR 89, applied

12.   The qualitative assessment required by the fifth element of the offence of wilful misconduct in public office, namely the necessary condition that the misconduct have the requisite serious quality, meriting criminal punishment, in light of the nature and importance of the office and the public objects served, confines the scope of the offence: at [139].

R v Dytham [1979] 1 QB 722; Question of Law Reserved (No 2 of 1996) (1996) 67 SASR 63; Shum Kwok Sher v HKSAR (2002) 5 HKCFAR 381; Attorney General’s Reference (No 3 of 2003) [2004] EWCA Crim 868; [2005] QB 73, applied

13.   The Court was not convinced that the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Quach was plainly wrong: at [133]-[140].

Fifth issue: duty 

14.   The primary judge found that members of Parliament’s duties are analogous to those of a fiduciary. His Honour did not find that members of Parliament are fiduciaries: at [146].

15.   The primary judge merely indicated a preliminary view as to the content of the duty owed by members of Parliament, such that nothing was determined by the primary judge so as to engage the proposition in Bass v Permanent Trustee Company Ltd [1999] HCA 9; 198 CLR 334 at [57].

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: Mr Edward Moses Obeid was formerly a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales. On 8 May 2015 he was arraigned on an indictment charging him with one count of wilfully misconducting himself in a public office. The indictment has been amended, and now charges him as follows:
	


“Between 1 August 2007 and 30 November 2007 in Sydney in the State of New South Wales, then holding public office as a Member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales [he] did in the course of or connected to his public office wilfully misconduct himself by making representations to Stephen Paul Dunn, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, Maritime Property Division of the Maritime Authority of New South Wales, with the intention of securing an outcome from the said Maritime Authority favourable to Circular Quay Restaurants Pty Ltd in respect of its tenancies of properties at Circular Quay knowing at the time he made the representations that he had a commercial and/or beneficial and/or family and/or personal interest in the said tenancies which he did not disclose to Stephen Paul Dunn.”


	
	Mr Obeid has pleaded not guilty to the charge. His trial, originally fixed to commence on 19 October 2015, has been adjourned. By notice of motion dated 9 September 2015, he applied (apparently, pursuant to s 17 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW)) for the indictment to be set aside, stayed or quashed, on a suite of grounds. No point appears to have been taken that the application was made too late: cf R v Beckett [2015] HCA 38 at [3]. The primary judge, Beech-Jones J, heard wide-ranging argument over two days on 9 and 10 September, and dismissed the application on 22 September 2015 for reasons which may fairly be described as comprehensive, and which have significantly assisted the resolution of this appeal: R v Obeid (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1380.
	
	
	The primary judge declined to certify that the judgment was one appropriate for determination on appeal: R v Obeid (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 1441. Accordingly, Mr Obeid seeks and requires leave to appeal, under s 5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), relying on most of the matters raised at first instance. The Crown did not oppose leave being granted, and argument proceeded on the basis that there would be a grant of leave.
	
	
	The appeal was given a high measure of expedition, in light of the adjourned trial set down early next year.
	
	
	The issues arising are as follows: (a) Does the Supreme Court have jurisdiction to hear and determine the charge, or is this a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Legislative Council? (b) Is a member of the Legislative Council a “public officer” for the purposes of the offence? (c) Should the indictment be stayed because parliamentary privilege, associated with but not limited to Article 9 of the Bill of Rights, will prevent the misconduct being proved? (d) Is the indictment bad for extending the charge beyond conduct “in the course of” Mr Obeid’s office to conduct “connected to” that office? (e) Did the primary judge err in formulating the duty owed by Mr Obeid?
	
	
	For the reasons which follow, Mr Obeid’s submissions on each of those issues must be rejected and his appeal dismissed.
	


A. Does the Supreme Court have jurisdiction to hear and determine the charge?

Introduction


	
	The question of jurisdiction should be addressed at the outset.
	
	
	Jurisdiction was only raised late, in oral submissions when the motion was heard by the primary judge (“It has occurred to my learned friend, Mr Nixon and I, reading the authorities this morning, that there may be a preliminary issue of jurisdiction in this case”). That may in part explain why the primary judge took the unusual course of addressing it last: see at [8].
	
	
	Mr Obeid invited this Court to defer the question of jurisdiction, which would not arise if he were right about the meaning of “public officer”. But the “first duty” of a court is to determine whether it has jurisdiction. In this country, that obligation is associated with the statement by Griffith CJ in Federated Engine-Drivers and Firemen’s Association of Australasia v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (1911) 12 CLR 398 at 415; subsequent decisions may be seen in Zhang v Zemin [2010] NSWCA 255; 79 NSWLR 513 at [39]-[45]. The importance of doing so was made plain in CSL Australia Pty Ltd v Formosa [2009] NSWCA 363; 261 ALR 441 at [22] and Eberstaller v Poulos [2014] NSWCA 211; 87 NSWLR 394 at [14]-[32]. It is difficult to envisage situations where the determination of jurisdiction should be deferred, especially if, as here, jurisdiction is contested. Acceding to the request would create the possibility of a decision made without jurisdiction, which is not only unsatisfactory to the losing litigant, but may also give rise to submissions as to its precedential authority (indeed, one of Mr Obeid’s submissions on the “in connection with” point concerning R v Quach [2010] VSCA 106; 201 A Crim R 522 bore precisely this flavour).
	
	
	Jurisdiction divides into subject-matter and personal jurisdiction: see PT Garuda Indonesia Ltd v Australian Competition & Consumer Commission [2012] HCA 33; 247 CLR 240 at [14]-[17]. A court must, if it is to have authority to decide a controversy, have jurisdiction both over the parties and also in respect of its subject matter. Mr Obeid’s submissions as to jurisdiction are based on the latter, not the former. He did not object to the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction when pleading not guilty, nor when applying for the indictment to be quashed or stayed, and thus there can be no question but that the court has personal jurisdiction over him. The position would have been different in the eighteenth century, had he been a member of the House of Commons, as the famous decision of the Court of Common Pleas in R v Wilkes (1763) 2 Wils KB 151 illustrates. Members of Parliament, at least in England, formerly enjoyed an immunity from some forms of criminal process, including an immunity from arrest for crimes excluding treason, felonies and breaches of the peace: see E Campbell, Parliamentary Privilege in Australia (1966, Melbourne University Press) pp 60-61 (a passage not appearing in the later edition).
	


Mr Obeid’s submissions based on the powers of the Legislative Council


	
	In order to advance the submission that the subject matter of the charge falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Legislative Council, Mr Obeid drew upon a deal of authority directed to a different, not to mention highly complex, area, namely, the implied powers of a chamber of the New South Wales Parliament. He contended that the chamber’s powers and privileges were now to be equated to those of the House of Commons. Even if that were not so, Mr Obeid’s proposition was that the powers and privileges of the Legislative Council were such as to place the charge made against him within the exclusive jurisdiction of the chamber, and thus outside the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. He submitted that:
	


“there are cases which say that the test of whether a jurisdiction is exclusive is this test of necessity, the very same test which has been applied in relation to whether a power does exist”.


	
	For a number of reasons, this is not the right way to approach the threshold question in this appeal.
	
	
	Mr Obeid correctly observed that the High Court had declined fully to resolve all of the issues argued in Egan v Willis [1998] HCA 71; 195 CLR 424. The essential difficulty is that the New South Wales Constitution has no provision, such as s 49 of the Commonwealth Constitution or s 19 of the Constitution Act 1975 (Vic), equating the powers, privileges and immunities of the chambers of the New South Wales Parliament with those of the House of Commons in the United Kingdom. Nor has legislation been enacted seeking to state those powers, privileges and immunities generally (contrast the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 (Cth)), although bills to do so were introduced in 1879, 1901, 1911 and 1912: see Egan v Willis at [180]. In the absence of any express conferral of power, it has been found necessary to resort to old law, often associated with Kielley v Carson (1842) 4 Moo PC 63; 13 ER 225 (on the powers of the House of Assembly of Newfoundland), as to the implication of powers which are “necessary to the existence of such a body, and the proper exercise of the functions which it is intended to execute”. This is sometimes described as a test of “reasonable necessity”: see Egan v Willis at [31].
	
	
	The Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council of New South Wales have been – more so than any other chamber in the British Empire and, later, Commonwealth – the occasion for appellate litigation on this issue. The appeals include Barton v Taylor (1886) 11 App Cas 197; Willis and Christie v Perry (1912) 13 CLR 592; Armstrong v Budd (1969) 71 SR (NSW) 386; Egan v Willis and Egan v Chadwick [1999] NSWCA 176; 46 NSWLR 563. Even so, basic questions such as whether either chamber has power to punish or to expel a member remain unsettled: see Egan v Willis at [55], [108] and [184].
	
	
	Mr Obeid invited this Court to adopt the submissions of the Commonwealth Solicitor-General in Egan v Willis summarised at 195 CLR 432-433 as to the enhanced powers of the Legislative Council following the enactment of the Australia Acts 1986 (Cth) and (UK). The submission elaborated upon earlier obiter statements to similar effect by Mahoney P and Priestley JA in Egan v Willis in this Court: (1996) 40 NSWLR 650 at 685-6 and 691-2. The Commonwealth Solicitor-General had referred to the role of State Parliaments under the Commonwealth Constitution, by reference to ss 7, 9, 10, 15, 25, 29, 30, 31, 41, 51(xxxvii) and (xxxviii), 95, 107, 108, 111, 123 and 124, and ss 1 and 3 of the Australia Acts.
	
	
	Mr Obeid’s invitation must be rejected. This Court must not rule on this submission, the question plainly being one arising under the Constitution, so that the duty in s 78B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) applies. It may confidently be inferred that Mr Obeid made a deliberate and considered choice not to distribute requisite notices under s 78B. The matter was raised squarely by Senior Counsel for Mr Obeid at a directions hearing on 2 October 2015. Senior Counsel for Mr Obeid described in some detail the late service of s 78B notices in Egan v Willis (by reference to p 431 of the report in the Commonwealth Law Reports) and outlined the potential for arguments turning upon ss 106 and 107 of the Constitution and the Australia Acts. It was then said:
	


“to be candid, it is possible to present the argument in a way that, if you like, just hugs the Chaytor decision fairly closely and does not go into the Commonwealth constitutional background or the Australia Acts”.

A timetable was directed which provided for the service of notices. No notices were served. Mr Obeid’s forensic decision had consequences extending beyond the scope of permissible submissions in this Court. Mr Obeid objected, successfully, to the intervention of the Attorney-General, who would otherwise have had a right to intervene under s 78A of the Judiciary Act. 


	
	Even if s 78B(1) did not prevent this Court from determining the question, Mr Obeid, having made those forensic choices, should be confined to the narrower submissions outlined by his Senior Counsel on 2 October 2015.
	
	
	However, the answer to the threshold question of jurisdiction does not turn upon the tactical decisions made by Mr Obeid. It is possible to take a course resembling that taken by the High Court in Egan v Willis. The High Court was able to resolve that appeal, favourably to Mr Willis, on the basis that the power of the Legislative Council was as narrow as that for which Mr Egan contended: see at [34]. Similarly, and without deciding the point, the balance of this appeal can be decided on the assumption, favourable to Mr Obeid, that the powers and privileges of the Legislative Council are, subject to statute, the same as those of the House of Commons.
	
	
	All of that said, the starting point of legal analysis is not the powers and privileges of the Legislative Council, but the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Egan v Willis was about an implied power, while Mr Obeid contends in his appeal for an exclusion from this Court’s jurisdiction. The test for determining whether a court lacks jurisdiction is different from the test for determining whether a parliamentary chamber has a power or privilege.
	


Common ground in relation to jurisdiction


	
	Mr Obeid conceded, readily and responsibly, that members of Parliament are subject to the ordinary criminal jurisdiction of the courts including the Supreme Court. That follows from the original conferral of jurisdiction (by reference to the jurisdiction of the superior courts at Westminster) when the Supreme Court of New South Wales was established, and is confirmed by s 23 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) which provides that the Supreme Court “shall have all jurisdiction which may be necessary for the administration of justice in New South Wales”.
	
	
	Mr Obeid submitted that that grant was to be read as subject to principles from the Constitution Act 1902 (NSW). Alternatively, he submitted that it was not “necessary” for this Court to have subject-matter jurisdiction in respect of the conduct to which the indictment was addressed.
	
	
	However, as Mr Obeid properly acknowledged, it is not appropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words: The Owners of the Ship “Shin Kobe Maru” v Empire Shipping Co Inc (1994) 181 CLR 404 at 421. As was said in this context in Rost v Edwards [1990] 2 QB 460 at 478:
	


“a court, while giving full attention to the necessity for comity between the courts and Parliament, should not be astute to find a reason for ousting the jurisdiction of the court and for limiting or even defeating a proper claim by a party to litigation before it. If Parliament wishes to cover a particular area with privilege it has the ability to do so by passing an Act of Parliament giving itself the right to exclusive jurisdiction. Ousting the jurisdiction of the court has always been regarded as requiring the clearest possible words.”


	
	Mr Obeid also conceded, properly, that any exclusive jurisdiction on the part of the Parliament or one of its chambers is subject to statute. Examples of the latter may be seen in the particular legislation in Arena v Nader (1997) 42 NSWLR 427 or, more generally, the legislation authorising investigations by the Independent Commission Against Corruption into corrupt conduct including by members.
	
	
	In short, Mr Obeid accepted that to the extent that some power or privilege of the Legislative Council deprived the Supreme Court of subject-matter jurisdiction, the power or privilege had to be read subject to statute, and the deprivation of jurisdiction was to be assessed against the presumption that clear language was required to do so.
	


Mr Obeid’s submissions that the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction


	
	In support of his submission that the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction, Mr Obeid relied on a range of matters. First, he pointed to the famous words of Dixon CJ, speaking for the whole Court, in R v Richards; Ex parte Fitzpatrick and Browne (1955) 92 CLR 157 at 162:
	


“it is for the courts to judge of the existence in either House of Parliament of a privilege, but, given an undoubted privilege, it is for the House to judge of the occasion and of the manner of its exercise”.


	
	Mr Obeid fastened upon the word “occasion”. His submission was that there was no dispute that the chamber had power to discipline him for misconduct. It followed, so it was said, that it was for the chamber and the chamber alone to judge whether or not Mr Obeid had in fact misconducted himself, and if so what measures were appropriate.
	
	
	He pointed to the appropriateness of that result, by reference to Article 9 of the Bill of Rights, and the “wider principle” of which Article 9 was a manifestation, and questions of deference by the courts to the Parliament. Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689 (1 Will & Mar sess 2 c 2) provides:
	


“That the Freedom of Speech and Debates or Proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parliament” (spelling modernised).


	
	Egan v Willis confirms that Article 9 applies in New South Wales (see at [129]). Mr Obeid submitted that it was sufficient for the conduct to be incidental to speech or proceedings in Parliament in order to attract the privilege. He submitted in writing that:
	


“the exclusive cognizance of the Westminster Parliament extends to matters which touch on the core activities of Members of the House, that is, which relate in some way to the legislative or deliberative processes of the House: Chaytor at [122][.] Where an allegation of criminal conduct against an MP relates to conduct within the exclusive cognizance of the Westminster Parliament, the MP could not be prosecuted for that crime in the ordinary courts: Chaytor at [113].”


	
	In oral submissions, Mr Obeid acknowledged the difficulty of formulating the metes and bounds of any area of exclusive jurisdiction, but relied on what was said by McHugh J in Egan v Willis at [67]:
	


“Furthermore, the common law courts will not examine the administration of the law – including statute law – within the walls of Parliament when the matters involved relate only to the internal procedure of a House of Parliament. What is said or done within the walls of a parliamentary chamber cannot be examined in a court of law.”


	
	The “wider principle” of which Article 9 was a manifestation was mentioned in Prebble v Television New Zealand Ltd [1995] 1 AC 321 at 332, to the effect that “the courts and Parliament are both astute to recognise their respective constitutional roles”. Mr Obeid pointed to what he said was an exclusive code regulating conflicts of interest, found in s 14A of the Constitution Act 1902 (NSW), and to the Code of Conduct governing members of the Legislative Council. He emphasised that part of the Crown case was that the allegations against him were, at the least, “connected with” his office.
	
	
	Mr Obeid relied on certain industrial relations decisions, principally Canada (House of Commons) v Vaid [2005] SCC 30; 1 SCR 667 and President of the Legislative Council (SA) v Kosmas [2008] SAIRC 41; 175 IR 269. In the former, Mr Vaid was the chauffeur to the Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons, and argued that his employment was sufficiently connected with proceedings in Parliament or the internal affairs of the chamber so as to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the chamber. The submission was rejected. However, Binnie J, who delivered the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, acknowledged that there were some matters which were:
	


“within this necessary sphere of matters without which the dignity and efficiency of the House cannot be upheld, courts will not inquire into questions concerning such privilege. All such questions will instead fall to the exclusive jurisdiction of the legislative body” (at [29.7]).


	
	Vaid was applied by the South Australian Industrial Relations Court in Kosmas, a claim for overtime made by the secretary of a parliamentary committee. The Full Court determined, as a preliminary question, that the Industrial Relations Court of South Australia lacked jurisdiction. It divided those engaged by a chamber of Parliament into two groups: those “engaged in the direct business of the House, the investigation, debate and legislating”, and “those indirectly engaged”: at [40]. It found that Mr Kosmas fell into the former category, and that “the dignity and efficiency of the legislation [scil, Legislature] would be diminished by answering the requirements of a trial of the issues and submission to the authority of a Court”: at [41].
	
	
	Mr Obeid submitted that the subject matter of the crime with which he had been charged fell within the same area of exclusive cognisance of the Legislative Council.
	
	
	Finally, in response to a submission by the Crown characterised by Mr Obeid as “because the Parliamentarian will get off scot free”, he submitted that even on a restrictive view, the chamber had powers which could be used “for discipline, for protective purposes, for defensive purposes, for coercion ... and for specific and general deterrence” in relation to misconduct by a former member.
	


Mr Obeid’s submissions on jurisdiction must be rejected


	
	Mr Obeid’s submissions on jurisdiction must be rejected for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, as Lord Phillips PSC said in R v Chaytor [2010] UKSC 52; [2011] 1 AC 684 at [64], “[t]he exclusive cognisance of Parliament was originally based on the premise that the High Court of Parliament had its own peculiar law which was not known to the courts”. The same idea underlies the traditional approach to the exclusive jurisdiction of visitors of lay corporations: see R v Hull University Visitor; Ex parte Page [1993] AC 682 at 695 (it may be controversial if and to the extent that that continues in Australia: see Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7; 221 CLR 99 at [40]). But there was no suggestion by Mr Obeid, nor could there be, that the underlying principle had any bearing upon the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction to hear and determine the common law misdemeanour with which he has been indicted.
	
	
	Secondly, Mr Obeid misreads what was said in R v Richards; Ex parte Fitzpatrick and Browne. Let it be assumed for present purposes, favourably to Mr Obeid and contrary to the submissions of the Attorney-General, who appeared as amicus, that the Legislative Council has power to discipline a former member for misconduct. Even so, it is readily seen that the argument proves too much. It by no means follows that anything which might fall within the ambit of that power thereby falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the chamber. The “occasion” for the exercise does not mean that a court has no jurisdiction merely because a chamber might choose to exercise a power.
	
	
	Dixon CJ’s words in R v Richards; Ex parte Fitzpatrick and Browne were directed to the jurisdiction of courts. The Chief Justice was confirming, in the first half of the sentence quoted above, that the existence of a privilege or power on the part of the parliamentary chamber was something of which the court was the ultimate arbiter. The second half of the sentence presupposed that it was no longer in dispute as to whether the power or privilege existed (“given an undoubted privilege”). In those circumstances, the courts had no authority to decide whether the exercise of the power or privilege was or was not called for in any particular case, and no authority to decide whether the way in which the power or privilege had been exercised was too harsh or too lenient. The passage says nothing in support of Mr Obeid’s submission that a court lacks jurisdiction in respect of some statutory or common law claim.
	
	
	That accords with the position in respect of the House of Commons. In R v Chaytor, the leading judgments were those of Lord Phillips PSC and Lord Rodger JSC. Both dealt in terms with the overlapping criminal jurisdiction of the courts and the House of Commons. Lord Phillips said at [83]:
	


“The House [of Commons] does not assert an exclusive jurisdiction to deal with criminal conduct, even where this relates to or interferes with proceedings in committee or in the House.”


	
	Lord Rodger rejected the notion of exclusive jurisdiction at [108]:
	


“Therefore the mere fact that the House could treat a matter as one of contempt does not mean that the House must do so. On the contrary, if the conduct in question would also constitute an offence under the ordinary criminal law of England, then the individual can be prosecuted in the criminal courts in the usual way. The jurisdiction of the House to deal with the matter as one of contempt overlaps with the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts to deal with it as a criminal offence. In short, the matter does not fall within the exclusive cognisance of Parliament” (original emphasis).


	
	As noted at the outset, it does not for present purposes matter what the precise scope of the powers and privileges of the Legislative Council of the New South Wales Parliament be. They do not exceed those of the House of Commons, and matters which do not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the House of Commons likewise do not fall within the jurisdiction of the Legislative Council.
	
	
	Thirdly, it is essential to bear in mind the applicable statutory provisions. Section 14A, on which Mr Obeid relied does not assist, and s 13A, to which this Court directed his attention, is inconsistent with his submission.
	
	
	Section 13A of the Constitution Act 1902 (NSW) relevantly provides:
	


“13A Further disqualifications

(1) If a Member of either House of Parliament:

…

(e) is convicted of an infamous crime, or of an offence punishable by imprisonment for life or for a term of 5 years or more, and is the subject of the operation of subsection (2),

his seat as a Member of that House shall thereby become vacant.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(e), a Member is the subject of the operation of this subsection if:

(a) the Member has not lodged an appeal against the conviction within the prescribed period, or

(b) the conviction has not been quashed on the determination of an appeal or appeals lodged within the prescribed period, or

(c) such an appeal has been lodged within the prescribed period but has been withdrawn, or has lapsed, without being determined, and no other appeal lodged within the prescribed period is pending.

(3) Nothing in this section affects any power that a House has to expel a Member of the House.”


	
	Section 13A(3) is expressly inconsistent with exclusive jurisdiction. The sole purpose of that subsection is to confirm that the powers of the chamber may be exercised concurrently with those of the court. That is to say, the premise of s 13A is that a court has subject-matter jurisdiction when a member is charged. It follows that, to that extent, the jurisdiction of the parliamentary chambers cannot be exclusive.
	
	
	What is more, s 13A is squarely directed to the power of a chamber to determine misconduct by its members, and the ultimate sanction of expulsion from the chamber. The section necessarily entails that the composition of the chamber may be affected by a curial determination of criminality. Indeed, its effect is that the curial determination ipso facto will give rise to a vacancy in the member’s seat.
	
	
	Section 13A may be contrasted with s 14A, on which Mr Obeid relied. Section 14A empowers the making of regulations relating to the disclosure of pecuniary interests. Section 14A(2) empowers a chamber to declare a member’s seat vacant if the member has wilfully contravened such a regulation. It may be accepted that the conduct with which Mr Obeid has been charged falls within the scope of that power.
	
	
	Although s 13A necessarily entails a concurrent jurisdiction of the courts and the parliamentary chamber, there is nothing (save for Mr Obeid’s assertion) to suggest that s 14A supports an exclusive jurisdiction of a chamber of Parliament. There is nothing to suggest that the s 14A(2) mechanism is exclusive, and when ss 13A and 14A are read together, as they must be, it is plain that s 14A cannot be so regarded. The Code of Conduct, on which Mr Obeid also relied, takes the matter no further.
	
	
	Fourthly, all of the foregoing is also consistent with the series of cases on bribery of members of Parliament referred to below, including R v White (1875) 13 SCR (NSW) (L) 322, R v Boston (1923) 33 CLR 386 and (more recently) R v Greenway [1998] Public Law 357. It should be regarded as settled that a member of the New South Wales Parliament can be prosecuted in a court for accepting a bribe, or for conspiring to accept a bribe. Despite the lengthy submissions in this Court, and before the primary judge, these questions were settled by R v White and R v Boston.
	
	
	Fifthly, turning to the industrial relations cases on which Mr Obeid relied, it must be noted that Kosmas was a decision of an inferior court of limited jurisdiction. It is not an intermediate court of appeal to which the principles of comity stated in Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; 230 CLR 89 apply. Next, the Solicitor-General appeared for the President, and Mr Kosmas appeared for himself. The resulting “inequality of arms” detracts from the weight to be given to the decision (see for example White v Johnston [2015] NSWCA 18; 87 NSWLR 779 at [100]-[101]). But, fundamentally, it is one thing for a specialised body dealing with industrial relations not to have authority over certain persons employed within a Parliament. It is another thing entirely to deny jurisdiction in respect of a crime at common law to a superior court of record.
	
	
	Taking the principles stated in Vaid and Kosmas at their highest, the question arises why it is necessary for the dignity of the Parliament or its chambers, or for the maintenance of some power or privilege, to exclude the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in respect of the indictment in this prosecution. There is no reason why that should be so, and indeed s 13A tells powerfully against any such inference being drawn.
	
	
	Sixthly, turning to the reliance placed upon Article 9 and the principles associated with it, let it be assumed, favourably to Mr Obeid, that matters wholly internal to a chamber fall within that chamber’s exclusive jurisdiction, in accordance with what McHugh J said in Egan v Willis at [67]-[70]. Without seeking to delineate the limits of that jurisdiction, it is plain that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the indictment to which Mr Obeid has entered a plea of not guilty, for the following reasons.
	
	
	The indictment does not in its terms make allegations of any conduct within the walls of Parliament relating only to the internal procedure of the chamber.
	
	
	Further, even on the broadest view of Article 9, the indictment in no way impeaches speech within Parliament, or any proceedings in Parliament. Mr Obeid relied upon the expansive definition of “proceedings in Parliament” in s 16(2) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 (Cth): “all words spoken and acts done in the course of, or for purposes of or incidental to, the transacting of the business of a House or of a committee”. Let it be accepted, for the sake of argument, that the federal Act accurately describes the meaning of “proceedings in Parliament”. Even so, it is plain that the indictment does not concern matters incidental to parliamentary speech or proceedings. This turns on the nature of the Crown case. Different considerations arise if the defence of a charge is impacted by parliamentary privilege. As was said in Prebble v Television New Zealand Ltd [1995] 1 AC 321 at 338, “there may be cases in which the exclusion of material on the grounds of parliamentary privilege makes it quite impossible fairly to determine the issue between the parties”. But those matters go to the different question of whether the prosecution ought to be stayed (which is touched on in section C below). The question of jurisdiction does not turn on the nature of the defence of the accused; if that were not so, there would be cases where a court had jurisdiction to accept a guilty plea and impose sentence, but no jurisdiction to determine the accused’s guilt following a plea of not guilty.
	
	
	Moreover, the passages from R v Chaytor relied on by Mr Obeid do not support the propositions for which they have been cited. Paragraph 122 in terms concerned the “overlapping” jurisdiction of the chambers to deal with conduct as a contempt and the ordinary criminal jurisdiction of courts. It was sufficient in R v Chaytor to observe that a prosecution of members for abusing their allowances did not touch upon the core activities as members; that does not mean that the converse proposition – anything which does touch upon the core activities of a member is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the chamber – is made out. But if Mr Obeid’s submission were accepted, then the necessary consequence would be that no court could prosecute a charge of bribery in relation to a member’s vote, or criminal conspiracy in relation to a member’s vote, both of which are matters more closely connected with the functions of members than the conduct with which Mr Obeid has been charged. That is contrary to R v White, R v Boston and R v Greenway which are addressed below.
	
	
	The primary judge was correct to reject Mr Obeid’s submission that the Supreme Court of New South Wales lacked jurisdiction in respect of this trial.
	


B. Does a member of the Legislative Council hold a “public office” for the purposes of the offence?


	
	Mr Obeid submitted that a member of the Legislative Council did not hold public office. He relied upon what was said by Lord Mansfield in R v Bembridge (1783) 3 Dougl 327; 99 ER 679; 22 St Tr 1, which was said to tell against the offence extending to members of Parliament. He referred to the language in the judgment of “appointed” to an office and the “grant” of an office, to the office being “accepted”, and to the importance of being answerable criminally to the King. He added that the office should be seen as executive or administrative, or governmental. By reference to historical notions, as well as to the language of the Constitution Act 1902 (NSW), he submitted that a member of the Legislative Council did not fall within that description.
	
	
	Mr Obeid emphasised the fact that there was no case of the offence ever being prosecuted against a member of Parliament, and said that this Court should defer to the judgment of the Executive disclosed by the absence of prosecutions. He relied heavily on the dissenting judgment of Gavan Duffy and Starke JJ in R v Boston, and on selected writings, mostly but not invariably from the nineteenth century. Thus it was that his Senior Counsel submitted:
	


“So just pausing there, we’ve got Boston, we’ve got these 19th and 20th century authorities, they’re all one way. We’ve then got this key, this seminal authority of Bembridge also described as being a critical decision and as the leading authority[.] ... Fourthly, I’ve attempt to digest the various relevant factors that go to the issue of public office, if that be the relevant enquiry. ... Fifthly and finally … I’ve tried to buttress the argument by reference to the Constitution. Your Honours I’m bold enough to submit that this is looking like one way traffic on this issue.”


	
	The submissions were advanced efficiently and capably, not to mention forcefully. However, they must be rejected. It is convenient to adhere more closely to the order of topics addressed in the written submissions, and start with R v Bembridge.
	


R v Bembridge


	
	The case law has long treated R v Bembridge as the modern starting point for this offence. Mr Obeid proceeded on that basis. Lord Mansfield CJ there said, of an accountant in the office of the Receiver and Paymaster-General of the Forces who concealed omissions in the final accounts in 3 Dougl 327 at 331:
	


“The law does not consist of particular cases but of general principles, which are illustrated and explained by these cases. Here there are two principles applicable: first, that a man accepting an office of trust concerning the public, especially if attended with profit, is answerable criminally to the King for misbehaviour in his office; this is true, by whomever and in whatever way the officer is appointed. … Secondly, where there is a breach of trust, fraud, or imposition, in a matter concerning the public, though as between individuals it would only be actionable, yet as between the King and the subject it is indictable” (emphasis added).


	
	As reported in State Trials (22 St Tr 1 at 155) the passage is:
	


“The law does not consist in particular instances, though it is explained by particular instances and rules, but the law consists of principles which govern specific and individual cases, as they happen to arise. Now, there are two principles which seem to me clearly applicable to this prosecution; the first I will venture to lay down is, that if a man accepts an office of trust and confidence, concerning the public, especially when it is attended with profit, he is answerable to the king for his execution of that office; and he can only answer to the king in a criminal prosecution, for the king cannot otherwise punish his misbehaviour, in acting contrary to the duty of his office, and that this holds equally by whomsoever or howsoever he is appointed to the office, by whomsoever the office is given. There are many offices of a public nature that concern, in various ways, the whole kingdom and the king as the executive part of the constitution, which are not given directly by the king, and not given by letters patent; many that have the grants of offices; the lord steward has the grant of the judge of the marshalsea; the lord chancellor appoints the masters in chancery, and I have the appointment of a great many officers belonging to this court; ...

There is another principle too, which I think applicable to this prosecution, and that is this; where there is a breach of trust, a fraud, or an imposition in a subject concerning the public, which, as between subject and subject, would only be actionable by a civil action, yet as that concerns the king and the public (I use them as synonimous [sic] terms), it is indictable; that is another principle of which you will make the application to the present case, without my losing time in doing it” (emphasis added).


	
	Mr Obeid favoured the much longer report in the State Trials, which purports to be the original, unrevised shorthand taken by Mr Gurney for the Treasury (see at 27). There are difficulties with both reports. The report in the State Trials was the first volume published by Thomas J Howell, who took over editing the fifth edition of the report from his father, Thomas Bayley Howell, in 1817, more than three decades after the decision was delivered. The reporter is unknown. Holdsworth wrote that:
	


“[t]he reports [in this series] are of very varying degrees of authority. They are, as Wallace has said, ‘written by hundreds of different persons, some of them known but little, and many of them not known at all’”: A History of English Law, (1966, Sweet & Maxwell Ltd), vol XII, p 130.

At least part of the verbosity in the report may be a reporter’s embellishment, reflective of the time, rather than the words of the Chief Justice.


	
	The first two volumes of the reports of Sylvester Douglas (later, Lord Glenbervie) have always been highly regarded. However, the third volume was not published until 1831, and one scholar has recently observed that the publisher had compiled nearly the whole of the third volume from “[s]everal volumes of notes by an unknown hand, apparently taken with care and accuracy”: J Oldham, “The indispensability of manuscript case notes to eighteenth-century barristers and judges” in A Musson and C Stebbings (eds), Making Legal History (2012, Cambridge University Press) 30 at 37, and see p iv of the preface to Vol III.
	
	
	However, it will not be necessary to take the point any further, because the points Mr Obeid sought to draw emerge moderately clearly from both reports. Both reports employ the language of “acceptance”, of the “appointment” and “grant” of offices. Both reports in substance refer to an office holder being accountable criminally to the King. It is true that the report in the State Trials contains references to a series of offices “granted” indirectly from the King, and to “the king as the executive part of the constitution”.
	
	
	Mr Obeid made the sound point that the language of the Constitution Act 1902 (NSW) is different. Members of the Legislative Council are said in that Act to hold a seat, rather than being appointed to an office. They are not answerable to the Crown. They are not members of the Executive. Perhaps Mr Obeid’s most powerful point based on the text of the Constitution Act emerges from ss 47 and 47A. Those sections refer in terms to the appointment of public officers by the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council, in marked contradistinction with the language used to describe members of the legislative chambers.
	
	
	That said, a member may not sit or vote until he or she has taken the pledge of loyalty “to Australia and the people of New South Wales” or the oath of allegiance to the Sovereign, Her heirs and successors according to law: Constitution Act, s 12.
	
	
	There are, however, a series of difficulties with this textual submission which emerge from R v Bembridge. The first is that Lord Mansfield did not himself use the language of “public office” or “public officer”. By way of anticipation of what follows, it will be noted that the language of “public office” is not used in either passage reproduced above; instead Lord Mansfield is reported as referring to “a trustee of the public” and either an “office of trust concerning the public” (Douglas) or an “office of trust and confidence concerning the public” (State Trials).
	
	
	The second is that Lord Mansfield was focussing upon the breadth of the offence, and not adverting to the question whether it extended to a member of Parliament. It is difficult to read into the broad language used by Lord Mansfield in respect of a man who plainly held a public office in the executive government a limitation excluding a member of Parliament.
	
	
	The third is that the references to “answerable to the king” and the executive part of government are necessarily to be read broadly, in a way which extends to judicial officers. That is clearest from the report in the State Trials, favoured by Mr Obeid. Accordingly, only limited weight is to be given to language which might be thought ordinarily to exclude members of the Legislature.
	
	
	The fourth difficulty is fundamental. This is not a case of a statutory offence. It is a case of an offence at common law. The common law has shown a strong disinclination to delineate the scope of the offence. This is apparent from the extracts from R v Bembridge reproduced above, as well as from subsequent decisions. Some were reviewed by Lord Parker CJ in R v Llewellyn-Jones [1968] 1 QB 429, who endorsed the approach taken by the primary judge (Widgery J) not “to attempt to give an exhaustive definition of what was covered by misbehaviours in a public office” (at 436). More recently, and in this country, Olsson J, after reviewing the earlier authorities, stated in Question of Law Reserved (No 2 of 1996) (1996) 67 SASR 63 at 78 that “the emphasis was not on any generic description, by way of nomenclature, but, rather, the inherent nature of the detailed conduct”. In the same appeal, Doyle CJ agreed generally with Olsson J’s judgment, and approved the following statement by P Finn in “Official Misconduct” (1978) 2 Criminal Law Journal 307 at 307:
	


“To this day, the precise metes and bounds of this offence remain uncertain. Indeed there has been – and still is – a tendency to regard ‘official misconduct’ as but a descriptive formula for a series of specific but interrelated offences such as oppression, neglect of duty, abuse of official power, fraud in office, etc.  As a general offence it is, nonetheless, still recognised and applied as part of the common law of England.”


	
	For those reasons, R v Bembridge does not provide the powerful support in favour of Mr Obeid’s submissions that was attributed to it.
	


R v Boston


	
	In order to determine what R v Boston stands for, it is helpful to go behind the report of the High Court judgment in (1923) 33 CLR 386.
	
	
	A criminal information was filed in 1923 against Walter James Boston, John Andrew Harrison and Henry Ernest Mitchelmore. Boston had been a member of the Legislative Assembly. The three men were charged with two counts, in respect of the second of which the trial judge, Ferguson J, allowed a demurrer. Only the second count came before the High Court, on an urgent appeal by the Attorney-General.
	
	
	The second count was that:
	


“[They] did unlawfully conspire together and with persons whose names are to the Attorney-General unknown that certain large sums of money should be corruptly given by the said John Andrew Harrison and Henry Ernest Mitchelmore and certain other persons to the said Walter James Boston in his official capacity the said Walter James Boston then being a public officer to wit a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, and that the said sums of money should be corruptly accepted by the said Walter James Boston in his said official capacity as inducement to the said Walter James Boston in violation of his official duty to do or omit to do certain acts to wit to use his position as such member to secure the inspection of, acquisition and the payment in cash for certain estates by the Government of the State of New South Wales and which said estates were to be paid for out of the public funds of the said State and to put pressure upon the Minister for Lands and other officers of the Crown to inspect acquire and to pay cash for certain estates the said payment to the said Walter James Boston being to the public mischief of the subjects of Our said Lord the King in the said State and against the peace of Our Sovereign Lord the King His Crown and Dignity.”


	
	The report on p 5 of the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 September 1923 of the submissions made by Mr Mack KC, who appeared for Mr Boston, the member of Parliament, includes the following:
	


“Before the Jury was empanelled, Mr Mack, KC, contended that the Indictment was in effect bad. He argued that a member of Parliament was not a public officer, and, therefore, could not be prosecuted as a ‘public officer’. A member of Parliament, he argued, was not a public officer as he had no office. They could talk about the office of the Attorney General, or the State Treasurer. A member of Parliament was not paid by the Crown. He did not get wages. All that he got was an allowance for expenses. What was right for a member of Parliament to do, was wrong for a public officer. A bribe given to a member of Parliament might be a misdemeanour, but they had to prove that it was a bribe.”


	
	The ruling by Ferguson J was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 26 September 1923, p 10:
	


“His Honour in ruling on the objections said on the first count ...

With regard to the second count ... [i]t had never been decided whether such an act was criminal. It was admitted that if Boston had been an officer of the Crown any payment of money to him would have been bribery. A member of Parliament had some kind of duty to keep the executive on the right track, but if he agreed to accept money to execute that duty then, according to the High Court, such agreement was void and not enforceable. The evils that might follow from acts of that kind were evident. It was a very short step to accept money to influence his vote in the House. What was charged in the second count was not an offence. It should be an offence, but it was not, and it was not for him to make it an offence. He ruled that there was a case for the Crown in the first count, and he ruled in favour of defendants in the second count.”


	
	A majority of the High Court granted special leave, allowed the appeal, and set aside the judgment of Ferguson J. The application was argued over four days. Whether or not a member of the Legislative Assembly was a public officer, as was alleged in the information, was squarely in issue, as is apparent from the reports of argument as summarised in the Commonwealth Law Reports. Mr Mack is recorded as submitting (33 CLR 386 at 391):
	


“A member of Parliament is not a public officer (see Constitution Act 1902 (NSW), secs 12, 26, 27, 33, 47), and proof that he was a member would not prove that he was a public officer. If it was proved only that Boston was a member of Parliament, the Judge would have to direct an acquittal. The result is that the second count is bad for duplicity. The words ‘public officer’ imply service of some sort to some employer, and cannot include a member of Parliament.”


	
	More details of the submissions advanced to the High Court may be found in newspaper reports. Relevantly for present purposes, the Sydney Morning Herald (17 November 1923, p 14), recorded:
	


“Mr Justice Gavan Duffy: Supposing the words ‘a public officer’, were omitted from the count and Boston were charged as a member of Parliament, would that alter the indictment?

Mack: Yes; our defence would be different altogether. A public officer had certain duties, and it might be a crime for him to accept a bribe. It might also be a wrong to bribe a member of Parliament, but bribery of a member of Parliament was different from bribery of a public officer.

He submitted as he did in the lower Court that as the Crown could not prove that Boston was a public officer, he was entitled to an acquittal.”


	
	Mr Obeid placed great reliance upon the reasons of Gavan Duffy and Starke JJ. It was said that they were “[t]he only two judges ever to look at this issue”. The entirety of their Honours’ reasoning on this issue is as follows at 413:
	


“The form of words used is adopted from the indictment in the case of R v Whitaker [1914] 3 KB 1283, and is appropriate only to a case of conspiracy to induce malversation by a public officer in his public office. In our opinion, a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales is not the holder of a public office within the meaning of the common law, and, even if he could be regarded as the holder of such an office, the acts charged as intended to be done by the defendant Boston, however improper they may be, would not be malversation in his office, or acts done in his office, unless they were done in the discharge of his legislative functions.”


	
	Thus Gavan Duffy and Starke JJ in terms responded to the submission that the inclusion of the words “a public officer” was critical to the validity of the information. Their Honours’ reasons are short, and dissenting. They favoured dismissing the appeal, and were therefore, as Mr Obeid pointed out, taken to have been proceeding on the basis that special leave had been granted (the Commonwealth Law Reports record at 388 that although special leave had not been granted, the appeal was argued as if it had, reserving to the defendants the right to seek its revocation).
	
	
	It may be accepted that the passage from Gavan Duffy and Starke JJ was essential to their Honours’ reasoning, and responded to a submission regarded by King’s Counsel appearing for Mr Boston as dispositive of the appeal. In light of the criticisms made by Mr Obeid of the reasoning of other members of the Court, it must be said that the conclusion of Gavan Duffy and Starke JJ was unsupported by any reasoning or authority. As it was put by the Crown, their conclusion “lacks authoritative support”.
	
	
	The majority comprised Knox CJ, Isaacs and Rich JJ, and Higgins J. They agreed to grant special leave, to allow the appeal and to order Mr Boston to answer an information which alleged that he was a public officer.
	
	
	Thus a majority of the High Court necessarily rejected Mr Boston’s submission – express on the face of the Commonwealth Law Reports, and confirmed by newspaper reports of the submissions at first instance and on appeal – that a sufficient answer to the second count on the information was that a member of the Legislative Assembly was not a “public officer”. Even if the reasons were opaque on this issue (which they are not), R v Boston is supportive of the Crown’s submissions, not Mr Obeid’s.
	
	
	But the reasons of the majority are not opaque on this issue. Although those of Knox CJ do not address the question whether a member of a parliamentary chamber is a public officer, the other members of the majority do so in terms.
	
	
	Isaacs and Rich JJ said at 402:
	


“A member of Parliament is, therefore, in the highest sense, a servant of the State; his duties are those appertaining to the position he fills, a position of no transient or temporary existence, a position forming a recognized place in the constitutional machinery of government. Why, then, does he not hold an ‘office’? In R v White it was held, as a matter of course, that he does. That decision is sound. ‘Office’ is defined in the Oxford Dictionary, as including:– ‘4. A position or place to which certain duties are attached, esp. one of a more or less public character; a position of trust, authority, or service under constituted authority.’ And ‘Officer’ is defined (inter alia) as ‘2. One who holds an office, post, or place. (a) One who holds a public, civil, or ecclesiastical office; ... a person authoritatively appointed or elected to exercise some function pertaining to public life.’ Clearly a member of Parliament is a ‘public officer’ in a very real sense, for he has, in the words of Williams J in Faulkner v Upper Boddington Overseers, ‘duties to perform which would constitute in law an office’” (emphasis in original, citations omitted).


	
	Mr Obeid was very critical of the reasons of Isaacs and Rich JJ. In particular, he submitted that the reliance on R v White (1875) 13 SCR (NSW) (L) 322 was misplaced, and emphasised that the meaning of “public office” was highly sensitive to context.
	
	
	There is force in the latter aspect of Mr Obeid’s submissions. He relied on what had been said in Sykes v Cleary (1992) 176 CLR 77 at 96-97 (“the meaning of ‘office’ turns largely on the context in which it is found”) and Edwards v Clinch [1982] AC 845 at 860, where Lord Wilberforce doubted the value of resorting to dictionary definitions for the meaning of the term “office”. The same point was made more recently by Allsop P in Leerdam v Noori [2009] NSWCA 90; 255 ALR 553 at [48] (“[t]he context in which the question arises will, of course, be important to the ascertainment of its content”) and, more generally, in the authorities considered in 2 Elizabeth Bay Road Pty Ltd v The Owners - Strata Plan No 73943 [2014] NSWCA 409; 88 NSWLR 488 at [81].
	
	
	However, it is not correct to submit, as Mr Obeid did, in writing and orally, that Isaacs and Rich JJ were incorrect to say that R v White “held” that a member of Parliament is a public officer.
	
	
	In R v White, the question was whether an agreement to pay money to secure the vote of a member of the Legislative Assembly disclosed an offence. The charge was one of bribery as opposed to misconduct. Two of the three judges dealt with the question of public office. Hargrave J concluded at 334 that:
	


“the old Common Law prohibition against bribery has long since extended beyond mere judicial officers acting under oaths of office, to all persons whatever holding offices of public trust and confidence; and it seems impossible to understand why members of our Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council, who are entrusted with the public duty of enacting our laws, should not be at least equally protected from bribery and corruption as any Judge or constable who has to carry out the law.”


	
	Mr Obeid submitted that this did not go far enough. He submitted that Hargrave J merely held that it was sufficient in order to sustain an offence of bribery to hold an office “of public trust and confidence”, and that that fell short of amounting to a finding that a member held a public office.
	
	
	It may be doubted that the distinction propounded by Mr Obeid is a valid one. It will be seen that Hargrave J’s reasoning amounted expressly to an invocation of what today might be termed coherence, and was alive to the distinction between an executive officer (“who has to carry out the law”) and a member of a parliamentary chamber, such as Mr White. Indeed, Hargrave J’s language closely resembles that of Lord Mansfield in R v Bembridge.
	
	
	Faucett J said at 336-339 that:
	


“[T]he case appears to me to come within a very simple, but very general principle, which is to be deduced from all the cases and authorities that were cited during the argument. That principle is, that any person who holds a public office or public employment of trust, if he accepts a bribe to abuse his trust – in other words, if he corruptly abuses his trust – is guilty of an offence at Common Law[.] ... This is not confined, as it seems to have been at one time supposed, to corrupt conduct or dealing in, or with, judicial offices, or offices connected with the administration of justice, but is applicable to all public offices to which a trust is attached.

...

Now it cannot be doubted that a member of Parliament holds a public office. ... [I]t is sufficient to say that he has a right to be present whenever a question is put to the vote; and it is especially his duty and his right to be present and vote whenever the expenditure of the public money is in question. He is thus a public officer clothed with a public trust, and if he accepts a bribe to abuse that trust, he is at Common Law guilty of a misdemeanour”.


	
	Faucett J’s reasons likewise are expressed to turn on whether a member of Parliament holds a public office because it is for that reason that bribing the member or the member’s accepting of a bribe amounts to a misdemeanour. Martin CJ’s reasons did not address the point.
	
	
	True it is that R v White does not compel the answer to the question whether a member of Parliament is a public officer for the purposes of the offence of misconduct in a public office. R v White is, after all, a case of bribery. That said, considerations of coherence powerfully tell against a result that it is an offence for a member of Parliament to accept a bribe but not an offence for the same member to engage in other forms of misconduct.
	
	
	The fourth and final member of the majority in R v Boston was Higgins J. He addressed the submissions made as to public officer in terms (at 412):
	


“This count alleges that the defendant Boston is a ‘public officer to wit a member of the Legislative Assembly’; and some discussion has taken place on the question is he a public officer. He certainly is not a public officer within the Public Service Acts; nor is he to obey the commands of the King or of the departmental heads. In R v White Faucett J says confidently that a member of Parliament holds a public office; and in Henly v Mayor of Lyme Best CJ says that ‘every one who is appointed to discharge a public duty, and receives a compensation in whatever shape, whether from the Crown or otherwise, is constituted a public officer.’ But without deciding that the allowance paid to a member of Parliament for his expenses is to be treated as compensation for his public duty, it seems to me immaterial whether the member is to be treated as a public officer or not. He is a member of Parliament, holding a fiduciary relation towards the public, and that is enough” (citations omitted).


	
	Thus Higgins J rejected Mr Mack’s submission not on the basis that Mr Boston was a public officer, but on the basis that the submission was insufficient to invalidate the information. Higgins J regarded it as sufficient, in order for the information to amount to a conspiracy involving an agreement to do an unlawful act, for Mr Boston to have been a member of Parliament, “holding a fiduciary relation towards the public”.
	
	
	The reasoning in the passage reproduced above reflects what Higgins J had earlier said at 407 by reference to R v Bembridge:
	


“‘When an officer has to discharge a public duty in which the public is interested, to bribe that officer to act contrary to his duty is a criminal act. To induce him to show favour or abstain from showing disfavour where an impartial discharge of his duty demands that he should show no favour ... is to induce him to act contrary to his duty; where this is done corruptly it is an indictable misdemeanour at common law’ (R v Whitaker). The count, therefore, discloses a contract, a conspiracy, to do something unlawful, even criminally unlawful. It is true that in Whitaker’s Case the word ‘officer’ is used. It was a case of a colonel of a regiment receiving bribes from a contractor for canteens; but the same principle applies to all persons ‘accepting an office of trust concerning the public’ (per Lord Mansfield in R v Bembridge)” (citations omitted).


	
	That passage reflects the language of Lord Mansfield in R v Bembridge. One reading of Higgins J’s judgment is that his Honour was conscious of the criticism (on which, ironically, Mr Obeid relied to undermine what was said by Isaacs and Rich JJ) as to the malleability of the word “office” and returned to the underlying nature of the common law offence.
	


The nineteenth and twentieth century authorities


	
	Mr Obeid also relied upon some nineteenth and twentieth century non-judicial materials which expressly excluded members of Parliament from the offence.
	
	
	Mr Obeid referred to the Seventh Report of Her Majesty’s Commissioners of Criminal Law (1843), which provided in a chapter dealing with “Offences against the Executive Power” that “the term ‘officer’ shall not be deemed to extend to any member of either House of Parliament, as such” (p 153). The chapter does not on its face purport to define the elements of the common law offence.
	
	
	Likewise, Sir James Fitzjames Stephen’s Digest of the Criminal Law expressly excluded from his account of offences constituting abuses and obstructions of public authority “any member of either House of Parliament as such” (see article 123 “‘Public Officer’ defined” in the 5th ed, 1894). A footnote in that work explained the rationale:
	


“It would be foreign to the purpose of this work to discuss the question of the limits of the jurisdiction of the Courts of Common Law, and Ecclesiastical and Military Courts”.


	
	It is possible that the footnote reflected the former immunity from process of members of a House of Parliament, as opposed to the elements of the offence. It is also possible that Stephen was merely clarifying that his account was not exhaustive (this is consistent with the previous footnote, which states that “[i]t has not been thought necessary to include in this Part a variety of offences of a very special kind”). Since the nineteenth century authorities do not give any reasoning in support of the statements, it is difficult to know what was the basis of the exception, and accordingly difficult to assess their persuasiveness.
	
	
	More recently, the 1976 Royal Commission on Standards of Conduct in Public Life (the ‘Salmon Report’) stated that:
	


“[W]e note the fact that neither the statutory nor the common law applies to the bribery or attempted bribery of a Member of Parliament in respect of his Parliamentary activities. ... Nor does membership of Parliament, as such, constitute public office for the purposes of the common law”: see Chapter 17, at [307].

Once again, the report gave no reasons and cited no authority.


	
	Little effort is required to perceive that the non-judicial materials are not nearly so one-sided as presented by Mr Obeid. The leading modern commentary is the work by C Nicholls QC et al, Corruption and Misuse of Public Office (2nd ed, 2011, Oxford University Press). At p 73 appears the following passage:
	


“Lord Mansfield’s words set out a key feature of misconduct cases from that date to the present; namely that, for the offence to be made out, one is not confined to the holder of an ‘office’ in a narrow or technical sense, but, rather, one is able, in a wider sense, to encompass the person who is performing a public function.”


	
	At p 75 the authors consider R v Boston, recording the passage from Isaacs and Rich JJ reproduced above, and then state:
	


“Of the judges in the majority in the Boston case, Higgins J undertook a detailed analysis of the concept of ‘public office’. Working from the Whitaker definition, he identified the key element in the test as whether or not there is an obligation to discharge a public duty in which the public is interested. He noted the words of Willes J in Lancaster and Worrell and reached the conclusion that ‘the application of the principle is not confined to public servants in the narrow sense, under the direct orders of the Crown’. We see from the approach of the majority in the Boston case a desire not to be constrained by a narrow definition. As with the earlier English authorities referred to above, the focus is on the nature and extent of the duty required to be performed; in essence, a functional, not titular approach.”


	
	The authors proceed to consider with evident approval more recent decisions in England (R v Greenway [1998] Public Law 357) and India (Rao v State of India [1999] 3 LRC 297), expressly holding that a member of Parliament was a public officer (at pp 75-76 and 79).
	
	
	The passages in the Salmon Report and in Stephen’s Digest on which Mr Obeid relied, unsupported as they were by any reasoning or authority, have been strongly criticised by G Zellick in “Bribery of Members of Parliament and the Criminal Law” [1979] Public Law 31. He criticised the latter as devoid of supporting authority and reasoning and added that “[i]n no sense may it be regarded as authoritative or as justifying the view of the Royal Commission”: at 40.
	
	
	Of course, the Salmon Report is the report of a United Kingdom Royal Commission, which may not have been referred to the Australian decisions of R v Boston and R v White. But even in the United Kingdom, things have moved on. The views expressed in it no longer represent the law, if indeed they ever did.
	
	
	In R v Greenway, a 1992 decision of Buckley J sitting in the Central Criminal Court reported in full in [1998] Public Law 357, similar issues were raised. Mr Greenway was a member of the House of Commons who was alleged to have accepted bribes for inter alia using his influence in relation to an application for British nationality and a company’s dealings with the British Railways Board. Mr Greenway moved to quash the indictment on the basis that bribery of a Member of Parliament was not a crime and the court had no jurisdiction, that being a matter for Parliament alone. It will be seen that, save insofar as Mr Greenway was charged with bribery, rather than misconduct in public office, the submissions were identical to those made by Mr Obeid.
	
	
	Buckley J recorded another submission recalling that made by Mr Obeid at 357:
	


“[Mr Greenway] relied heavily on the fact, as it appears to be, that there is no precedent for the trial in the criminal courts, as opposed to Parliament, of a Member of Parliament in respect of alleged bribery.”


	
	Buckley J referred in some detail to R v White, including stating at 360:
	


“In fact Faucett J went on to express the opinion that it could not be doubted that a Member of Parliament holds a public office. Were it necessary to do so I would agree with him.”


	
	Buckley J then turned to R v Boston at 360-361. When dealing with submissions based on Article 9, his Lordship said at 361-362:
	


“If, as is alleged here, a bribe is given and taken by a member of Parliament, to use his position dishonestly, that is to favour the briber as opposed to acting independently and on the merits, the crime is complete. It owes nothing to any speech, debate or proceedings in Parliament. Proof of the element of corruption in the transaction is another and quite separate consideration. Privilege might well prevent any inquiry by a court into Parliamentary debates or proceedings. However, it is not a necessary ingredient of the crime that the bribe worked. A jury will usually be asked to infer corruption from the nature of and circumstances in which the gift was given. I cannot see that Article 9 in any way prevents that.”


	
	His Lordship then said at 363:
	


“That a Member of Parliament against whom there is a prima facie case of corruption should be immune from prosecution in the courts of law is to my mind an unacceptable proposition at the present time. I do not believe it to be the law. The Committee of Privileges is not well equipped to conduct an enquiry into such a case, nor is it an appropriate or experienced body to pass sentence. Unless it is to be assumed that it would be prejudiced in his favour, I cannot see that it would be in the member’s own interest for the matter to be dealt with by the Committee. The courts and legislature have over the years built up a formidable body of law and codes of practice to achieve fair treatment of suspects and persons ultimately charged and brought to trial. Again, unless it is to be assumed that his peers would lean in his favour, why should a Member be deprived of a jury and an experienced judge to consider his guilt or innocence and, if appropriate, sentence? Why should the public be similarly deprived?”


	
	He rejected the submissions based on lack of precedent, although acknowledging that he was troubled by it. However, he added that “my task is to apply the law as I believe it to be and not to assume their discretion or try to make their decisions”.
	
	
	Following the decision of R v Greenway, there was a further inquiry into whether members of Parliament were subject to these offences. See D Oliver and G Drewry (eds), The Law and Parliament (1998, Butterworth), where it is stated at p 75:
	


“The 1995 Nolan report recognised the disparity between the decision of Buckley J and the conclusion of the Royal Commission and suggested that:

‘it is quite likely that Members of Parliament who accepted bribes in connection with their parliamentary duties would be committing Common Law offences which could be tried by the courts.’”

(The reference is to the Nolan Committee on Standards of Conduct in Public Life.)


	
	More recently, in Rao v State of India [1999] 3 LRC 297, the question was whether a member of Parliament was a “public servant” for the purposes of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988. The definition of “public servant” extended to “any person who holds an office by virtue of which he is authorised or required to perform any public duty”. Agrawal J, with whom Anand J concurred and Ray J agreed on this issue, addressed R v White and R v Boston in the course of addressing an argument similar to that made by Mr Obeid, that a member of Parliament holds a seat but does not hold an office. Their conclusion at [67] was:
	


“[W]e are of the view that membership of Parliament is an ‘office’ since it is a position carrying certain responsibilities which are of a public character and it has an existence independent of the holder of the office. It must, therefore, be held that the member of Parliament holds an ‘office’.”

Deference in the face of an absence of prosecutions


	
	Extracted above is the reaction by Buckley J to the submission that a member of Parliament had not previously been prosecuted for bribery, and his Lordship’s rejection of it. The same submission was made more than a century earlier in 1875 in R v White, and was rejected by Martin CJ at 331:
	


“It is urged that the notoriety of such transactions, and the absence of any prosecution in connection with them, is a strong reason for holding them to be cognisable by Parliament only. I cannot admit the force of such an argument.”


	
	The same submission appears also to have been made in R v Boston, as may be seen from the short judgment of Ferguson J, as well as from the statement by Higgins J at 407 that “[c]omment has been made on the peculiar fact that there are so very few cases bearing directly on the bribery of members of Parliament.”
	
	
	Mr Obeid submitted that this Court should acknowledge what was described as the “deference” or “acquiescence” of the Executive in not bringing charges against a member of Parliament. That submission should be firmly rejected, just as it was in R v White, R v Boston and R v Greenway. What the Executive considers to be the content of a statutory offence is of little bearing upon its legal meaning; the High Court has confirmed that the so-called Chevron doctrine applicable in the United States to the legal meaning of statutes forms no part of Australian law: Corporation of the City of Enfield v Development Assessment Corporation [2000] HCA 5; 199 CLR 135 at [44]; see also Commissioner of Taxation v Indooroopilly Children Services (Qld) Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 16; 158 FCR 325 at [4] per Allsop J; cf S Gageler, “The Master of Words: Who Chooses Statutory Meaning?” in A Connolly and D Stewart, Public Law in the Age of Statutes (2015, Federation Press), 12 at 21-25. The position in the case of an offence at common law is a fortiori. Heydon J wrote that “[t]he courts are masters of the common law, but servants of statutes”: PGA v The Queen [2012] HCA 21; 245 CLR 355 at [132], emphasising the greater susceptibility to change on the part of the common law. The choices made by the Executive (including within that term the independent decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions) do not bear upon the content of the offence at common law.
	


Other Australian authorities


	
	The primary judge gave weight to what had been said, in a somewhat different context, in Sneddon v State of New South Wales [2012] NSWCA 351. The main issue was whether the State was vicariously liable to Ms Sneddon for the tortious conduct of a member of the Legislative Assembly, who employed her in his office. That issue turned on whether the member was acting “in the service of the Crown” for the purpose of the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983 (NSW), but the reasons of each of the three members of the Court ranged widely. In particular, the judgment of Meagher JA contained passages supportive of the conclusion stated by Isaacs and Rich JJ in R v Boston that a member was a public officer. Meagher JA said at [224]:
	


“A member of the Legislative Assembly is not appointed to a position or office by or at the direction of the State acting either by the executive or by legislation. The member is elected by the people and ultimately is accountable to the people who the member represents. The office to which the member is elected is that of member of the Legislative Assembly. That is properly described as a ‘public office’. The member’s duties are ‘inseparably attached’ to that office. The member cannot be removed from that office by the State acting by the executive. Nor is the member accountable to the State acting by the executive in the discharge of any legislative or parliamentary function. Nor can he or she be controlled, directed or interfered with by the State in the discharge of those functions. Indeed the principle of responsible government requires that the member be and remain, as far as possible, independent of improper influence of the executive government so as to be able to watch and call it to account if necessary. That this should be so was described by Isaacs and Rich JJ as being ‘the keystone of our political system’.”


	
	Further, in relation to the authority of what was said by Isaacs and Rich JJ in R v Boston, Heydon J in Williams v The Commonwealth [2012] HCA 23; 248 CLR 156 at [444] said that “[a]n ‘office’ is a position under constituted authority to which duties are attached”. His Honour cited the passage from Isaacs and Rich JJ with approval.
	


Conclusions


	
	It is idle to pretend that all of the decisions and academic writings point in the same direction; they do not. However, contrary to the submissions of Mr Obeid, the considerable weight of judicial authority (R v White, R v Boston and R v Greenway, to which may be added what was said by Heydon J in Williams and Meagher JA in Sneddon) is against his submission. So too is the weight of modern academic authority (including Corruption and Misuses of Public Office).
	
	
	Mr Obeid’s submission to the contrary requires a very narrow focussing on the words “public officer”, which is contrary to both the language of Lord Mansfield in R v Bembridge and an approach that identifies the content of a common law offence with principle as opposed to the language in which it is expressed. What is more, Mr Obeid’s submission gives rise to fine distinctions, and difficulties in terms of the coherent operation of the criminal law. Why should it be an offence for a member of Parliament to accept a bribe but not otherwise to misuse his or her position?
	
	
	Zellick observed at 38:
	


“[H]ow does a Member of Parliament measure up to these criteria? His salary is paid from public funds; he is very much a ‘public character’; his duties are exclusively of a public nature, concerned with the governance of the country, supervising the executive and legislating; the post if vacant will by operation of law be filled by someone else; there is unquestionably status, dignity, responsibility and public position; he is, perhaps more so that anyone else, ‘employed by the public’ and dismissible by them as no other officer is; and the public is plainly interested in the duties he discharges.”

We would respectfully agree.


	
	That conclusion wholly aligns with long-standing authority, read in the way indicated above, including R v White in 1875 and R v Boston in 1923, decided at times when the roles of members of the New South Wales Parliament were less readily perceived to be public officers than in the twenty-first century (especially in respect of their remuneration by way of salary and pension, their being elected by the people, and their service on house committees). The level of trust which was essential for Lord Mansfield and those who followed him is all the greater in the modern Parliament. It accords with the oaths or affirmations all members of the Legislative Council are required to take by s 12 of the Constitution Act 1902 (NSW).
	
	
	For those reasons, the primary judge was correct to conclude that a member of the Legislative Council was a public officer to whom the common law offence extended.
	
	
	It is therefore not necessary to address Mr Obeid’s further submission that there was error to the extent that the primary judge suggested that a member of a parliamentary chamber should have the status of a public officer. It was said that the courts “do not have power to expand the elements of common law offences so as to include conduct which has previously fallen outside the scope of that offence”. He relied on the judgment of McHugh J in R v Rogerson (1992) 174 CLR 268 at 304. He equated the position to the case where a court would construe a criminal statute narrowly. For completeness, it may be noted that McHugh J was in dissent in the result in Rogerson, and, more importantly, that common law offences are susceptible of incremental change, as noted in R v Clark (Mark) [2003] EWCA Crim 991; [2003] 2 Cr App R 23 at [13], endorsed in R v Rimmington [2005] UKHL 63; [2006] 1 AC 459 at [33], although if the scope of a common law offence is to be enlarged, it should be done “step by step on a case by case basis and not with one large leap”.
	


C. Does Article 9 require the indictment to be stayed?


	
	Senior Counsel for Mr Obeid mentioned, at the beginning of his address, that one “effect of the operation of parliamentary privilege might very well be to mean that his hands are tied completely or largely behind his back and that he cannot properly defend himself”. He added that:
	


“[O]ne of the things that was mentioned to Beech-Jones J, was that that application would be made before him in due course and that that was a matter which was as I say raised and in a sense hived off and is not part of what is before your Honours.”


	
	That may or may not be an accurate statement of what occurred. Nothing in these reasons should be read as endorsing any practice of splitting up applications for a stay, close to the time of trial, if that has occurred (as to which no view is expressed). It is mentioned merely to emphasise the narrowness of the point sought to be agitated in this appeal, which is narrower than the more familiar notion of a stay by reason of parliamentary privilege, as in Prebble v Television New Zealand Ltd [1995] 1 AC 321 at 338 and Rann v Olsen [2000] SASC 83; 76 SASR 450 at [38]ff.
	
	
	This submission overlaps with the threshold question of jurisdiction. As noted above, Mr Obeid relied upon a formulation of parliamentary privilege extending to what was incidental to speech or proceedings in Parliament. He then submitted that the Crown’s case was that the communication by Mr Obeid to a senior member of the Executive was “necessarily incidental to” the powers, duties and responsibilities exercisable by that member in Parliament. Mr Obeid then submitted:
	


“The primary judge accepted that the Crown’s case is that the relevant communications which are the subject of the Amended Indictment were communications with a senior public servant in relation to government policy. If a communication between an MLC and a senior member of the Executive were not subject to the privilege under article 9, then that could adversely affect the flow of information between legislature and executive and adversely impact the ability of MLCs to perform the parliamentary role of scrutinising the conduct of the Executive.

It follows that such communications come within the protection of article 9. That is, such communications are privileged, in the sense that the communications cannot be used in court proceedings for the purpose of establishing that the privileged material was false, misleading or made in bad faith.”


	
	Mr Obeid also submitted that even if the communications were not proceedings in Parliament, their examination would involve the questioning of Mr Obeid’s conduct in the performance of his parliamentary duty, and would therefore be prohibited by Article 9.
	
	
	The primary judge rejected these submissions. His Honour said at [132]-[133]:
	


“It is at this point that the argument breaks down. It elides the distinction between the function of an MLC in communicating with the Executive and its employees on the one hand and whether a particular communication had the requisite nexus with proceedings in Parliament on the other. ...

In this case the relevant action is not communicating with the [E]xecutive generally but communicating with Mr Dunn about the renewal of the leases in particular. There is nothing to suggest that particular communication had any connection to Parliamentary proceedings much less that denying it privilege was likely to impact adversely on the core business of Parliament. This conclusion is consistent with Greenway (see [53]). In Greenway Buckley LJ concluded that the prosecution of a member of the House of Commons for accepting a bribe to use their influence to support an application for citizenship was not affected by s 9 of the Bill of Rights. Proof of the offence “owe[d] nothing to any speech, debate or proceedings in Parliament”. His Lordship contrasted this with Ex p Wason (1869) LR 4 QB 573 in which it was held that a conspiracy to make false statements in the House of Lords could not be the subject of civil or criminal proceedings”.


	
	Mr Obeid’s submissions on appeal very substantially repeated those made at first instance (paragraphs 115, 116 and 117 of the submissions on appeal closely correspond to the submissions in paragraphs 5(d), (e) and 7 of the submissions dated 4 September 2015). They should be rejected for the reasons given by the primary judge.
	


D. The elements of the offence of misconduct in public office


	
	Misconduct in public office is a common law indictable misdemeanour with a long history predating the tort described or created by Holt CJ in Ashby v White (1703) 2 Ld Raym 938; 92 ER 126: see M Aronson, “Misfeasance in Public Office: A Very Peculiar Tort” (2011) 35 Melbourne University Law Review 1 at 15; and C Nicholls QC et al, Corruption and Misuse of Public Office (2nd ed, 2011, Oxford University Press), ch 3. For present purposes, however, it suffices to proceed immediately to the conclusions reached by the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Quach [2010] VSCA 106; 201 A Crim R 522 at [46], where the elements of the offence were formulated as follows:
	


“(1) a public official;

(2) in the course of or connected to his public office;

(3) wilfully misconduct himself; by act or omission, for example, by wilfully neglecting or failing to perform his duty;

(4) without reasonable excuse or justification; and

(5) where such misconduct is serious and meriting criminal punishment having regard to the responsibilities of the office and the officeholder, the importance of the public objects which they serve and the nature and extent of the departure from those objects.”


	
	It will be seen that the words “or connected to” in the indictment adhere to the second element of the formulation in R v Quach. The primary judge applied R v Quach, as a decision of an intermediate court of appeal on a question of common law: at [86]-[98]. He rejected various submissions advanced by Mr Obeid which do not appear to have been repeated on appeal. Conversely, the submissions advanced on appeal do not appear to have been made to the primary judge.
	
	
	Mr Obeid submitted that, having regard to other paragraphs in the judgment in R v Quach (he identified [38], [40], [41], [45] and [47]), the formulation in [46] could not be accepted at face value. It was said to be “inconsistent with a whole lot of other paragraphs in the judgment which indicate that it isn’t any connection that is sufficient, only some forms of connection”.
	
	
	Mr Obeid’s submission should be rejected. The judgment represents a consideration of various formulations of the offence, and [46] is the Court’s distillation of it. Indeed, it is difficult to see how the judgment could have been clearer: [46] commences “So amended, the elements of the offence are ...” and [48], answering the questions referred to the Court, is as follows:
	


“In respect of question 1, the elements of the common law offence of misconduct in public office are as set out in [46]. In light of the conclusion reached on this question, it is unnecessary to answer question 2.”


	
	Mr Obeid also submitted that the precedential weight of R v Quach was reduced because, subsequently, the High Court has criticised the procedure relied upon, namely, referral of a question of law pursuant to s 302 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2009 (Vic). The criticism of answering questions of law divorced from the facts of the case was made in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v JM [2013] HCA 30; 250 CLR 135 especially at [41], where the High Court confirmed that the section did not empower the referral of questions which would not arise in the particular proceedings in the trial of JM. But Mr Obeid did not submit that s 302 was inapplicable in R v Quach, where the questions were referred in the light of the factual circumstances reproduced in some detail in [3] of the reasons (essentially, alleged sexual activity by an off-duty police officer with a woman who had been seen in the course of the officer’s duties earlier that day). The fact that s 302 was improperly used in some other case in no way bears upon the precedential authority of R v Quach.
	
	
	Mr Obeid then submitted that R v Quach was plainly wrong in relation to this element of the offence. Mr Obeid acknowledged that the precedential question was that stated in Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; 230 CLR 89 at [135]. Three points were relied on in order to surmount this hurdle. The first was that more recent Hong Kong authority, HKSAR v Wong Lin Kay [2011] HKCFA 28; 15 HKCFAR 185, had held that in order for the conduct to be “in relation to” a public office, it must be conduct “in relation to powers and duties exercisable by him for the public benefit” (at [17]). The second was that United Kingdom authorities required as an essential element that the misconduct be of a public officer acting as such: see eg Attorney General’s Reference (No 3 of 2003) [2004] EWCA Crim 868; [2005] QB 73 at [6], [54] and [61] and R v Chapman [2015] EWCA Crim 539; 2 Cr App R 10 at [17]. The third was that “to frame the elements of the offence by reference to the need for a ‘sufficient connection’ with the office, without proving guidance on the nature of the connection required, is to leave the boundaries of the offence entirely at large”.
	
	
	All these submissions should be rejected. The Victorian Court of Appeal conducted a review of Australian, Canadian, English and Hong Kong decisions on precisely this question, and rejected an arguably narrower formulation proposed by the accused, namely, that the misconduct be by the public officer acting as such. (For completeness, it may be that there is no difference between a formulation using the words “acting as such” and one using the words “in relation to”: they are regarded as identical in Nicholls’ work at p 87; it is not necessary to resolve this question.) Further, R v Quach predates the reformulation in Wong Lin Kay. Thus the first and second of Mr Obeid’s submissions merely pointed to variations in overseas common law jurisdictions, one of which had been rejected by the Victorian Court of Appeal, the other of which (Chapman) post-dated it. Indeed, the Court in Chapman, although taken to earlier Hong Kong decisions, does not appear to have been taken to the reformulation in Wong Lin Kay. Nor does reference appear to have been made to the Australian decisions.
	
	
	More is required. Merely pointing to different overseas appellate decisions falls short of a submission of sufficient cogency to convince this Court that the considered decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal was plainly wrong.
	
	
	Turning to Mr Obeid’s third submission, what delineates this offence is not the presence or absence of connection between the conduct and the office, but rather the qualitative assessment required by the fifth element, which reflects what has been said in R v Dytham [1979] 1 QB 722 at 727-728, Question of Law Reserved (No 2 of 1996) (1996) 67 SASR 63 at 78-79, by Mason NPJ in Shum Kwok Sher v HKSAR (2002) 5 HKCFAR 381 at 409-410 and by the Court of Appeal in Attorney General’s Reference (No 3 of 2003) at [56]. These authorities were considered in R v Quach at [42]-[45]. Far from leaving the boundaries of the offence “entirely at large”, it is a necessary condition that the misconduct have the requisite serious quality, meriting criminal punishment, in light of the nature and importance of the office and the public objects served. It is this requirement, ultimately, which confines the scope of the offence. In an appeal in which many points were taken, there was no objection taken to the fact that the qualitative assessment required by the fifth element rendered the offence uncertain.
	
	
	This ground is not made out.
	


E. Duty


	
	No duty owed by Mr Obeid is mentioned in the indictment, nor in the statement of the Crown case. However, in answer to a request for particulars from Mr Obeid, the Crown stated that it asserted a breach of duty by Mr Obeid as amounting to his wilful misconduct. The particulars supplied by the Crown were the subject of submissions before the primary judge.
	
	
	The primary judge analysed the authorities concerning the duties of members of Parliament, including three decisions of the High Court: Wilkinson v Osborne (1915) 21 CLR 89; Horne v Barber (1920) 27 CLR 494 and R v Boston. His Honour did so, extensively, from [63]-[72]. His Honour’s analysis continued at [78]-[85], responding to particular submissions advanced by Mr Obeid.
	
	
	His Honour drew together the authorities and concluded at [75]-[76] as follows:
	


“Just as with the duties of a fiduciary, the various statements in Wilkinson, Horne and Boston as to the nature and scope of a parliamentarian’s duty reduce to a negative obligation not to use their position to promote their own pecuniary interests (or those of their families or entities close to them) in circumstances in which there is a conflict, or a real or substantial possibility of a conflict, between those interests and their duty to the public.

On this approach, and subject to hearing from the parties in this case, the jury would be instructed that the functions of MLCs extend to scrutinising the executive government of this State including the actions of Maritime. They would also be instructed that, unless it is self-evident that an MLC is only dealing with the executive in their personal capacity, an MLC’s functions extend to communicating with government Departments. Further, the jury would be instructed that, in so dealing, MLCs must not promote their own pecuniary interests (or those of their families or entities close to them) in circumstances in which there is a conflict, or a real or substantial possibility of a conflict, between those interests and their duty to the public. It would also follow that the jury would have to be instructed that, to conclude that Mr Obeid wilfully misconducted himself, they would have to be satisfied that in the circumstances he knew or was reckless that he was precluded from using his position to make representations to the Executive or its employees for the purpose of financially benefiting himself or members of his family or entities closely associated with himself or members of his family, but nevertheless chose to do so.”


	
	Mr Obeid was critical of the duty formulated by the primary judge. He maintained that members of Parliaments were not fiduciaries. He submitted that the duty as formulated was wrong, because there was no duty owed to “the public”, because the content of the duty was not revealed, and because there was further error in the application of the notion of informed consent in the circumstances. He also submitted that the parties were bound by what had been said, citing Rogers v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 251 and Bass v Permanent Trustee Company Ltd [1999] HCA 9; 198 CLR 334 at [57]. The essence of the submission was captured as follows:
	


“[S]o far as it is a duty owed by a fiduciary, only fiduciaries owe duties of that kind and we have submitted that a parliamentarian is not a fiduciary within that realm of discourse.”


	
	There is nothing in this ground.
	
	
	First, the primary judge did not find that members of Parliament were fiduciaries. Indeed, his Honour went out of his way to state that the duty encapsulated by him was merely analogous to that of a fiduciary (“Just as with the duties of a fiduciary”). The duty enunciated by the primary judge substantially conformed with what had been said by Meagher JA in Sneddon at [218]. The duty formulated at [75] drew upon, and on one view conflated, the two overlapping themes to which Deane J referred in Chan v Zacharia (1984) 154 CLR 178 at 198-199. Obviously there are similarities (hence, for example, the pecuniary interests register referred to above, and Lord Mansfield’s reference to “office of trust” in R v Bembridge), and it is to be recalled that the term “trust” is not a term of art in public law: see Bathurst City Council v PWC Properties Pty Ltd [1998] HCA 59; 195 CLR 566 at [47]. But there was not on any fair reading of the reasons a finding that a member of Parliament was a fiduciary in the strict private law sense on which Mr Obeid’s submissions rested.
	
	
	Secondly, his Honour said that “subject to hearing from the parties in this case”, the jury would be instructed in the terms stated. The primary judge was, expressly, indicating merely a preliminary view as to the content of the duty. Nothing was determined by the primary judge, so as to engage the proposition mentioned by the High Court in Bass at [57] that “[o]nce an issue is determined at the interlocutory stage, and the trial continues, the primary judge’s hand is tied ...” The precise formulation of the directions to the jury would, inevitably, turn upon the course of the trial, and the way the evidence unfolded. It is, with respect, impossible to read the reasons of the primary judge as somehow binding the parties, or for that matter the Court, in relation to the directions to be given to the jury.
	
	
	This ground should be dismissed.
	
	
	The following may be added. It will be an issue for the jury whether there was wilful misconduct. Accepting that the Crown case to date has proceeded on the basis that the misconduct involved a breach of duty, the precise articulation of that duty, to the extent it goes beyond the case as particularised, can, and should, await the course of the trial.
	


Orders


	
	A non-publication order made by a single judge constituting the Court of Criminal Appeal applied to the hearing. However, during the course of the hearing, it was indicated that it should be reviewed whether this Court’s judgment, and that of the primary judge, should be the subject of such an order. Because the considerations which arise relate to the conduct of the trial, that review is best left to the trial judge.
	
	
	The formal orders will be:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	
	
	Subject to order (4) below, order that, pursuant to s 8 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), it being necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice, this judgment not be published pending the determination of the trial.
	
	
	Remit for the consideration by the trial judge whether an order pursuant to the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) should be made in relation to this judgment and the judgments at first instance R v Obeid (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1380 and R v Obeid (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 1441.
	


[Note: Order 3 was discharged on 7 April 2016; see R v Obeid (No 8) [2016] NSWSC 388.]

		28 June 2016",2015-12-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2768413,New South Wales Crime Commission v Sakr [2015] NSWSC 1872,"Judgment


	
	By summons which I grant leave to file today, the New South Wales Crime Commission applied ex parte, seeking restraining orders under s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) in relation to the interest in certain property of the defendant, Helal Sakr. Other orders under s 12(1) and s 27 of the Act were also sought, as well as other consequential orders.
	
	
	The application was supported by an affidavit sworn on 8 December 2015 by Jonathan Lee Spark, the Commission’s Director (Financial Investigations) and an authorised officer under the Act, as well as by a statement of facts and circumstances provided in accordance with Rule 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that the orders sought should be made.
	
	
	The property sought to be restrained is identified in a schedule to the summons as real property located at Bankstown, registered in Mr Sakr’s name, as well as a vehicle and a boat registered in his name, funds held in identified bank accounts and cash seized on execution of a search warrant.
	
	
	Mr Spark deposed that he suspected that Mr Sakr had engaged in serious crime related activities within the definition of a “serious criminal offence” in s 6 of the Act, namely, supplying a prohibited drug (cocaine) contrary to ss 25(1) and (2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	Mr Spark provided a detailed explanation of the basis upon which he came to hold these suspicions. It rested on a consideration of a Court attendance notices and police facts sheets provided by Detective Senior Constable Howes of the New South Wales Police Force; answers to questions he asked of Detective Sergeant McGeachie in relation to the matters dealt with in these documents; as well as information obtained from searches conducted by Crime Commission officers of the COPS database, records held by the Land and Property Information in the Department of Finance, Services & Innovation database, information provided by the NSW Roads and Maritime Services by email, and information provided to the Commission on 1 December by the Westpac Banking Corporation pursuant to s 51 of the Act, as to monies held in the accounts the subject of the orders sought.
	
	
	This material disclosed that Mr Sakr has been charged with various supply offences under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, as well as an offence under s 193C of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) of dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime, after an investigation in which his calls were legally intercepted. A search warrant was executed at his premises, after he was heard to say that he had quit his employment and was living off money earned from the supply of cocaine.
	
	
	On search a large amount of drugs, cocaine and cannabis were found, as well as ammunition a replica firearm, cash and an application for a firearms license.
	
	
	Mr Spark deposed to his experience that, in the absence of a restraining order, it is possible for people to enter into unregistered mortgages in relation to real estate very quickly; to dispose of vehicles and vessels or to backdate forms disposing of such assets and to dispose of funds held in bank accounts very quickly, in order to defeat the operation of the Act. He also deposed to his view that, given the serious nature of the criminal activity in which Mr Sakr is apparently involved, that he should not be given notice of this application. That is a course available under the Act, although s 10A(4) permits a different course to be taken, if the Court thinks fit.
	
	
	Section 10A(5) requires the making of the orders sought under the Act, if the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the material which is relied on well establishes that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed and that the requirements of s 10A(5) of the Act have been addressed. In that situation, the Act requires that the orders sought in relation to the property in question be made. In the circumstances, I concluded that it was also appropriate to make the other orders sought.
	
	
	On the evidence, I am also satisfied that the Commission ought not to be required to give notice of this application and that it should be dealt with ex parte. In coming to that view, I had regard to the provisions of s 10C of the Act, which permits an affected person to apply to have a restraining order set aside, as well as the liberty granted in the order to the parties to apply to the Court on three days’ notice.

	I accordingly make orders in the terms sought, as well as ordering that the Commission serve a copy of this judgment on Mr Sakr. Those orders are:

		01 February 2016",2015-12-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768416,R v Payam [2015] NSWSC 1819,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	On 24 July 2015 Kazem Mohammadi Payam pleaded guilty on indictment to the charge that, on 7 July 2014, he murdered Nabil Naser. Various sentencing hearings later took place in which extensive documentation was tendered by both the Crown and the defence, and oral evidence was given. Mr Ierace SC, who appeared for the offender, objected to certain portions of the so-called Agreed Facts which had been tendered by the Crown, and a voir dire hearing was held in order to determine this issue. At the conclusion of the hearing I determined that the evidence was inadmissible, and said that I would give my reasons later. My written reasons for rejecting this evidence are being handed out together with these Reasons for Sentence.
	


Background of the Offence


	
	The background of the offence is as follows. The offender and the deceased knew each other by reason of the fact that they had had successive relationships with the one woman, whom I shall call Ms E. The deceased and Ms E commenced a relationship in 2005 and were married in 2006. They had a son, T, who was born in April 2008. In early 2010 the two of them separated. Ms E and her son moved to another address, but the deceased continued to see T on a regular basis. In September 2011 Ms E met the offender and they were married shortly afterwards. Thereafter there were considerable tensions between the offender and Ms E on the one hand and the deceased on the other, largely relating to the care and custody of T. The deceased commenced proceedings in the Family Court, seeking custody of T. On 30 May 2014 the Family Court ordered that T should continue to reside with his mother. The deceased was to have access to him every second weekend and for half of the school holidays.
	
	
	This did nothing to alleviate the tensions between the offender and Ms E on the one hand and deceased on the other. The situation was seriously exacerbated when the deceased, in accordance with the Family Court order, took T to Melbourne at the end of June 2014 to stay with relatives. While there the deceased took the boy to visit Ms E’s brother, from whom she had been estranged for a number of years. The two of them returned to Sydney on 5 July, and T was returned to the care of the offender and Ms E. When Ms E learned that T had been taken to visit her brother she became very upset.
	
	
	The next day, 6 July 2014, she telephoned the deceased, who confirmed that he had taken T to visit her brother. Ms E was apparently talking for most of the ten minute conversation. At the end of the call, the deceased said:
	


“Who cares where I take him. Next time I take him to Iran, maybe to your father”.


	
	Ms E was also estranged from her father, and at this she became very upset and was crying. The offender was said to be nearby, and could no doubt hear at least her part of this conversation. Indeed the offender later told the psychologist, Ms Jolan, that Ms E had been emotionally disturbed and hysterical as a result of the deceased’s actions, and this in turn had elevated the offender’s stress levels.
	
	
	That evening, 6 July 2014, the offender telephoned the deceased and asked to meet him the following morning. At first the deceased refused, saying that he did not want to meet the offender. However he later agreed to meet him the following morning at the Westfield Shopping Centre at Parramatta. The deceased’s nephew was with him at the time, and heard his end of the conversation. The deceased told his nephew the next morning that he had changed his mind and agreed to meet the offender because if he and the offender could talk calmly and logically, they might be able to solve the problems between them.
	


Events of 7 July 2014


	
	At about 10 o’clock the next morning, 7 July 2014, the deceased went, as arranged, to the Westfield Centre. The offender had already arrived at the centre by that stage, and had gone into Woolworths. There he bought a large kitchen knife which was still in its wrapping when he left the store, but was later concealed in the left sleeve of his jacket. A little over half an hour later the two of them met up and, after a few minutes, in which they were walking around the centre, apparently talking in a normal manner, they went and sat on a couch outside the Myer department store, with the offender sitting to the right of the deceased. The area was covered by CCTV, which showed what happened thereafter.
	
	
	The two of them were talking, sometimes in a reasonably animated fashion, but without any apparent conflict, for about seven minutes. Suddenly the offender got up, put his left arm around the back of the deceased and threw him to the ground, so that he was lying on his back. The offender had the knife in his right hand. He straddled the deceased’s upper body and stabbed him in the chest region on at least four occasions. He then sat on the couch beside where the deceased was lying and slashed him again, at least twice. After a short time he got to his feet and started to walk away, apparently dialling on his telephone.
	
	
	He returned to where the deceased was lying on three further occasions. The first time he did so he raised his right arm over the deceased, but it is not possible to discern whether he was again stabbing him. The second time he appeared to be feeling for a neck pulse. On the third occasion he picked up the knife from an ottoman beside the deceased and appeared to stab the deceased before sitting down beside him, still on the telephone. He then stood up, stabbed the deceased twice in the chest, and walked off, leaving the knife in the deceased’s chest. Shortly afterwards the offender removed his jacket, pullover and shirt. He told police later that he did this because he was “burning”. He was walking around, naked to the waist and talking on his telephone, when the police arrived.
	
	
	The offender made two telephone calls during this time. The first was a 000 call in which he apparently asked for the police and the ambulance. He was said to be in an emotionally heightened state during this call, sometimes yelling and swearing at the operator. He then telephoned Ms E. He told her that he had killed the deceased and that he loved her. It was at about this point that the police arrived. The offender was taken into custody and conveyed to Parramatta Police Station. There he agreed to participate in an electronically recorded interview with the assistance of a Persian interpreter. He declined the services of a lawyer.
	


The Offender’s Interview


	
	The interview commenced a little after 7.00pm and took approximately two hours. The offender first gave an account of his background, which I will be describing later in these reasons. He said that the deceased was his second cousin and, although they had never been close, they had enjoyed a cordial relationship. All this changed, he said, when the offender commenced his relationship with Ms E, at which point they became enemies. His own relationship with Ms E was, he said, a very good one. He described his relationship with T as “beautiful”, saying that the boy regarded him as his father. He denied that he had ever threatened the deceased, but said that the deceased had once threatened him.
	
	
	The offender admitted to telephoning the deceased the previous day and asking to meet him. He said he wanted to talk about the future of “their” son. The deceased eventually agreed to meet him the next morning at the Westfield Centre. Before meeting the deceased that morning, the offender said he went into Woolworths to buy a drink and saw a knife which he then bought. He was asked why he bought it, and said that he did not know…it was “by accident”, as he put it. After he and the deceased had been talking for a while, the offender said the deceased started saying rude things about the offender and E, and spat in his face. The offender lost control, and – to use his own words – said “I think it was Satan that came to me”. Later he said that he did not want to kill the deceased, but the deceased had provoked him. He thought that he had stabbed the deceased twice. When asked whether it could have been more than twice, he said “I don’t think so”. Later he was shown the CCTV of the events, and said that he did not think that he had stabbed the deceased so many times.
	


Post Mortem Report


	
	An autopsy was conducted some time later by the forensic pathologist Dr Duflou. At that time the knife was still embedded in the deceased’s chest. Dr Duflou found there had been one stab wound to the deceased’s neck and six stab wounds to the chest, as well as three superficial chest wounds. The neck wound was about six to seven centimetres deep. It was the chest wounds which constituted the direct cause of death. Dr Duflou noted that they had caused extensive injury to the interior of the deceased’s body, with stab tracks passing into the cervical spine, the chest wall, the heart, the aorta, the left lung, the diaphragm and the stomach. No defensive injuries were identified.
	


Aggravating and Mitigating Factors


	
	I turn to discuss the potential aggravating and mitigating factors as relevant to this offence. In this regard, by far the most significant issue is the extent, if any, to which this killing was premeditated by the offender. As already indicated, the offender told the police in his interview that he had not intended to kill the deceased, but that he had been provoked by the things the deceased said about his wife, and by the deceased spitting at him. As to his purchase of the knife, the offender said that it was “by accident” that he went into Woolworths to buy a drink, and at the same time happened to see the knife and bought it. A little later he was asked whether he had bought the knife to stab the deceased. He answered:
	


“I swear to God that I didn’t want to kill him … he provoked me and he said very rude things.”


	
	When asked what he wanted to do with the knife, he said:
	


“I thought that, if necessary, I could just frighten him.”


	
	But when asked how he was going to frighten him, he said that his thoughts were “all over the place”.
	
	
	This is a particularly difficult issue in the circumstances of this case. As Mr Ierace’s submissions point out, there are a number of grossly irrational aspects to this killing. By committing the offence in a public place, and then telephoning 000 immediately afterwards, the offender was placing himself in a situation where he would inevitably face a lengthy prison sentence. His own personal background, which I will be describing later, gave him every reason to dread the prospect of incarceration. Indeed, he said to Ms E when he telephoned her immediately after making the 000 call: “My life is over now…”.
	
	
	On the other hand, the objective evidence points towards a killing which was contemplated, at the very least that morning and very possibly the previous evening. I have viewed the CCTV footage of these events on numerous occasions, particularly with a view to discerning whether anything unusual happened in the interplay between the two men immediately before the offender threw the deceased to the ground and started stabbing him. The camera was to the side and back of the men, so the angle is by no means perfect, but you can still get a generally reliable idea as to who was speaking at any particular time, and whether anything unusual was happening.
	
	
	I could discern nothing at all unusual in the interplay between the two men immediately before the offence. Certainly the deceased was the last one to talk, but his hand movements were no more pronounced than previously. As to whether their voices were raised immediately before the killing, there is a conflict of evidence. A Myers employee said that the first time he heard yelling between the two men, they were still sitting next to each other on the couch. A few seconds later he heard screaming and saw the offender leaning over something on the floor, which was clearly the deceased. On the other hand, an elderly man who was sitting on the other end of the same couch, said that the two men were chatting casually, and were not arguing at all, until suddenly the offender pushed the deceased to the ground and started stabbing him.
	
	
	One thing the CCTV footage does show with certainty is that the deceased did not spit at the offender immediately before these events, nor was there any sign of the offender “ducking”, as he later told the police.
	
	
	The accumulation of events leads me irresistibly to the conclusion that there must have been a degree of premeditation on the part of the offender, at the very least to injure the deceased and possibly to kill him. The fact that Ms E had been so distressed the previous day by the deceased’s actions is highly relevant here, as is the fact that it was on that same evening that the offender telephoned the deceased and asked to meet him the next day.
	
	
	The final straw in this regard is the purchase of the knife. It was a large knife, with a blade 20 centimetres long and a sharp point. Given the background of events at that stage, it is impossible to accept that it was a mere coincidence or accident which led to the offender selecting and purchasing this knife very shortly before he was due to meet the deceased. The fact that he then concealed it in his clothing when he met the deceased supports this, as does the fact that he already had it in his right hand immediately after he got up and pushed the deceased to the ground.
	
	
	For these reasons I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at least by the time the offender met the deceased on the morning of 7 July 2014, he had determined that he would, at the very least, stab him causing him injury. In addition, at the time the offender actually inflicted the fatal injuries, he must have intended to kill the deceased, not merely to injure him. The number and ferocity of the stab wounds bear clear testimony to this intention.
	
	
	This is a significant matter when one is assessing the objective seriousness of this offence. The culpability involved in a killing which is completely unpremeditated, and is an unplanned response to unexpected circumstances, is significantly less than that which arises from a killing which has been planned in advance. On the other hand, I accept that it was probably only that morning that the offender determined to injure or kill the deceased, in a situation where his wife had been extremely distressed by the deceased’s actions. This in turn involves significantly less culpability than a killing which has been premeditated well in advance, or for purposes of personal gain.
	
	
	In addition, it is almost certain that the offender’s impulsivity and anxiety problems must have played a major role in his behaviour that morning. As already mentioned, there are a number of highly irrational features to this offence. This in turn is a potentially mitigating feature, so long as it does not increase the offender’s level of dangerousness. I shall be saying more about this when discussing the psychiatric evidence given on sentence.
	
	
	A further aggravating factor, as the Crown submissions point out, is that this offence took place in a public area. The CCTV footage shows that several people came into this general area before the police arrived. The offender still had the knife in his hand during some of this time. Indeed, he pointed it in the direction of security staff, thereby no doubt causing considerable anxiety and alarm to a number of people.
	


Personal Circumstances of the Offender


	
	The offender was born in Baghdad in November 1978 and is of Kurdish heritage. His parents had little formal education. When he was still a baby his family moved to Iran, and thereafter lived in Tehran. Because they were refugees the offender was not allowed to go to school. Nevertheless he managed to gain literacy and numeracy skills through other means. From the age of eight he worked as a street vendor. By reason of his belonging to a particular military group, the offender was imprisoned for over eight years in an Iranian gaol. It is clear that during that time he suffered unspeakable horrors. These included spending nine months in solitary confinement in a small space with no running water or toilet facilities, so that he was forced to live with his own effluent. Moreover he suffered serious torture and horrific sexual assaults. He was apparently very depressed after his release from prison. In 2009 he came to Australia by boat and later gained a permanent visa. Thereafter he lived at various addresses in the western suburbs of Sydney.
	
	
	On 16 May 2011 the offender was convicted of one count of stealing from a person, the offence having been committed on 14 March 2011. He was fined $550. On 19 November 2011, he was convicted of one count of common assault, one of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and one of stealing from a person. All three offences were committed on 13 July 2011. The offender was placed on a bond to be of good behaviour for 18 months. A number of conditions were attached, including attending counselling and taking treatment in accordance with medical advice. The nominated psychologist was Ms Afsaneh Jolan.
	
	
	The offender had already been referred to Ms Jolan, whose report, dated 15 September 2015, was tendered on sentence. Between October 2011 and May 2014 the offender attended regular sessions with her. She said that his symptoms back in 2011, were consistent with a diagnosis of depression, anxiety associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, and anger problems. Other psychological disorders surfaced later, particularly the offender’s impulsivity. She said that in the last psychological sessions before he committed this offence, the offender had shown significant improvement. She did not see him again until shortly before writing her report, at which time, she said, he was extremely remorseful about this offence.
	
	
	The offender was also assessed by the forensic psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen, whose reports, dated 27 December 2014 and 11 September 2015 were tendered by the defence. Dr Nielssen interviewed the offender at the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre on 5 December 2014 for the purpose of his first report. In that report the doctor diagnosed the offender as suffering from an anxiety disorder associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, and a possible psychotic illness, based on the offender’s history of having had aural hallucinations in the past. However, the doctor said that there was little in the way of objective signs of a psychotic illness during the interview.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen again interviewed the offender on 26 August 2015 for the purpose of his second report. After that interview the doctor considered that it was less likely that the offender has a psychotic illness, as he reported no further symptoms and there was again little in the way of objective signs of such illness. On the other hand, the offender had been taking anti-psychotic medication and it was possible, the doctor said, that these were masking his symptoms. Dr Nielssen was unable to elicit a history of a direct link between the offender’s psychological symptoms and the present offence.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen gave evidence on sentence, in which he was asked by the Crown Prosecutor about this aspect of his report. The doctor said that a person who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder can have a heightened perception of threat and of arousal. These are the symptoms of anxiety disorder. When asked whether this might make the offender more of a risk on his release, he said that it would probably do so if his condition remained untreated, but these symptoms are very treatable. In any event, the risk of homicide recidivism is very low.
	
	
	I accept that, in all the circumstances, including the extreme irrationality of this offence, the offender is unlikely to present a risk to others upon his release, so long as he continues his treatment for his psychological condition.
	


Level of Criminality


	
	Since the High Court judgment in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39, a two-stage approach to sentencing is no longer to be undertaken. Nevertheless, it is still appropriate to assess the objective criminality of the offence in question. In this case, both the Crown and the defence agree that the objective criminality is below the mid-range, although the Crown submits that it is only slightly so, and I would have to agree that it is not significantly below the mid-level of criminality, taking account of the aggravating factors mentioned earlier. Mr Ierace did not seek to argue to the contrary.
	


Other Considerations on Sentence


	
	A moving Victim Impact Statement was presented on behalf of the offender’s nephew, who is still a school student. The rest of his immediate family lives in Iran, and he had come to regard the deceased as his father. He has been severely affected by the deceased’s death. The Crown has applied, pursuant to s 28(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Family Member Victim Impact Statement) Act 2014, to have the Victim Impact Statement taken into account on sentence. In accordance with the legislation, I take the statement into account as part of the harm which this offence has done to the community, and in accordance with the judgment of McCallum J in R v Halloun [2014] NSWSC 1705.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty to murder, and is therefore entitled to a reduction on sentence. The plea was not entered at the earliest opportunity, the reason being – as Mr Ierace’s submissions make clear – that the offender was waiting to receive a psychiatric assessment in order to determine whether a defence was available to him. As soon as he received this assessment, he entered his plea of guilty. In these circumstances, the offender is entitled to a significant discount on sentence. The Crown acknowledged this, and suggested that a reduction of 15% to 18% would be appropriate. In the circumstances I propose to reduce the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by approximately 18%.
	
	
	Given the offender’s background, the great majority of subjective factors are of a mitigating nature. Indeed the only aggravating factor is the offender’s previous record of convictions. In this regard, the fact that he was fined or placed on a bond on both occasions indicates that the offences were of a relatively low order of culpability. Apart from his imprisonment in Iran, he has never been in prison before.
	
	
	Mr Ierace has submitted that there are special circumstances in this case which warrant a departure from the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term of sentence, pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”). The offender would benefit, he submitted, from an extended period of supervision and counselling in the community, given his troubled life before arriving in Australia. In addition, the experience of imprisonment is likely to be significantly more onerous for the offender by reason of the trauma he suffered during his imprisonment in Iran, and the impact that this has had on him ever since. The Crown submitted that, given the length of sentence which is likely to be imposed for this offence, there will already be a lengthy period on parole which will be ample for the offender’s supervision and readjustment to community life.
	
	
	I accept that the offender’s experience of imprisonment is, by reason of his background, likely to be more difficult for him than it would be for a normal person, and that a lengthy period on parole might be of significant benefit to him. I propose to take account of these matters by reducing the non-parole period I would otherwise have imposed, but for the reasons expounded by the Crown, the reduction will not be a substantial one.
	
	
	The maximum sentence for the offence of murder is life imprisonment, and the standard non-parole period is imprisonment for 20 years. Since the decision in Muldrock, both of these have been recognised as guide-posts to be taken into account during the sentencing process.
	
	
	For the sake of the record I should say that, in determining the appropriate sentence, I have taken into account the purposes of sentence as set out in s 3A of the Act.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since 7 July 2014, and his sentence is to commence on that date.

	Kazem Mohammadi Payam, for the murder of Nabil Naser I sentence you to the following term of imprisonment:

2768417,R v Payam (No.2) [2015] NSWSC 1820,"Judgment


	
	The offender pleaded guilty to the murder of Nabil Naser on 8 July 2014. During the course of the sentencing proceedings the Crown sought to rely on the evidence of two witnesses to the effect that they had been told by the deceased that the offender had previously threatened him. This evidence was objected to by Mr Ierace SC, who appeared for the offender, and a voir dire hearing took place in which the two witnesses gave evidence of their conversations with the offender. Oral submissions then followed, after which I ruled the evidence inadmissible. I said that I would deliver my reasons later. These are my reasons for rejecting the evidence.
	
	
	The first witness, Mr Hamid Jaafar, was a cousin of the deceased who was living in Melbourne. He said that the deceased came and stayed with him on two occasions in 2014: first in January, when he stayed for three days, and again for one week, between 28 June 2014 and 5 July 2014, very shortly before his death. On the second occasion he brought his son, T, with him. Mr Jaafar said that on the first occasion, in January 2014, the deceased told him that the offender was in a relationship with his ex-wife, and that he kept threatening him, and that he had threatened him on two or three occasions. On the second occasion he said that the offender would be in trouble if he took any steps against him as he, the deceased, had written a letter to his lawyer and the police, telling them about the offender’s threats.
	
	
	The second witness, Mr Khalid Mohammad, was also a cousin of the deceased and who lived in Melbourne. The two of them kept regular contact over the telephone. He said that about a year before the murder the deceased told him that the offender had threatened him. The witness advised him to go to the police, and the deceased later telephoned him and told him that he had done so, and the problem had been resolved. He also said that the deceased told him that the offender had said to him:
	


“If you keep seeing your son and making my girlfriend unhappy, I am going to cut your head off.”


	
	There was a degree of uncertainty, from Mr Mohammad’s evidence, as to whether he was told about these threats in the one conversation, or whether there were two occasions on which the deceased told him about the threats. When asked in cross-examination about whether his memory of these conversations was better in July 2014, when he made a statement to the police, the witness answered:
	


“It has been more than a year, and I’m not sure even what I had for breakfast.”


	
	The evidence of these alleged threats was tendered to support the proposition that the offender had been planning this murder well in advance. Accordingly, it is hearsay and is thus prima facie inadmissible. The Crown relied upon the exceptions contained in s 65 of the Evidence Act 1995. That section, as relevant here, provides:
	


“(1)   This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.

(2)   The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation:

(a) …

(b)   was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication; or

(c)   was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable;”


	
	After hearing the evidence, the Crown accepted that there was nothing to establish that these representations were made by the deceased shortly after he had received the alleged threats, and therefore paragraph (2)(b) had no application. The submissions then centred upon paragraph (2)(c), and particularly whether there was evidence which made it highly probable that the representations were reliable. Mr Ierace pointed out, and the Crown accepted, that it is impermissible to use “bootstraps” reasoning, namely that the fact that the offender did indeed murder the deceased supports the reliability of the latter’s representations that the offender had threatened to kill him.
	
	
	Both counsel were in agreement that, in accordance with the judgment of Mason P in R v Ambrosoli [2002] NSWCCA 386, the focus must be upon the circumstances surrounding the making of the representation, rather than on the reliability of the asserted facts.
	
	
	In this case, Mr Jaafar said that the deceased told him that he had written a letter telling his lawyer and the police about the offender’s threats. However, there is no evidence of any letter written to the deceased’s lawyer. The deceased did make one complaint to the police, on 7 March 2014, but that was in relation to a threat said to have been made by the offender earlier the same day. There was no complaint made about other threats from the offender. Accordingly, there is no objective evidence to support the reliability of these representations.
	
	
	Mr Ierace pointed out that these representations were made by the deceased in circumstances where there had been an acrimonious split between the deceased and his former wife, who had then commenced a relationship with the offender, and the acrimony had then spread to the relationship between the two men. Indeed, an apprehended violence order had been taken out against the deceased on behalf of his former wife, his son and the offender. Mr Ierace submitted that it is not uncommon, in such a situation, for one person to make allegations about another which might not always be correct. I accept this to be the case. It is a highly relevant matter in the present circumstances, and potentially affects the reliability of the deceased’s assertions.
	
	
	Paragraph 65(2)(c) requires the Court to be satisfied that the relevant representations were made in circumstances which make it “highly probable” that the representation is reliable. In the circumstances of this case, for the reasons given above, I could not be satisfied of this matter. In the case of Mr Mohammad, his admittedly poor memory constituted an additional reason for having serious reservations as to the reliability of his account of the representations said to have been made by the deceased.
	
	
	It is for these reasons that I ruled the evidence to be inadmissible.

		11 December 2015",2015-12-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768420,New South Wales Crime Commission v Karim [2015] NSWSC 1873,"Judgment


	
	By summons which I grant leave to file today, the New South Wales Crime Commission applied ex parte, seeking restraining orders under s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) in relation to the interest in certain property of the defendant, Rose Abdul Karim. Other orders under s 12(1) and s 28A of the Act were also sought, as well as other consequential orders.
	
	
	The application was supported by an affidavit sworn on 4 December 2015 by Jonathan Lee Spark, the Commission’s Director (Financial Investigations) and an authorised officer under the Act, as well as by a statement of facts and circumstances provided in accordance with Rule 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that the orders sought should be made.
	
	
	The property sought to be restrained is identified in a schedule to the summons as real property located at Auburn, registered in Ms Karim’s name.
	
	
	Mr Spark deposed that he suspected that Ms Karim had engaged in a serious crime related activity within the definition of a “serious criminal offence” in s 6 of the Act, namely, obtain financial advantage by deception contrary to s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), by obtaining a loan from the ANZ Bank, having made false statements and provided false documents in support of the loan application.
	
	
	Mr Spark provided a detailed explanation of the basis upon which he came to hold this suspicion. It rested on a consideration of documents produced to the Commission by various entities under notices given under s 29 of the Act. The documents produced included:
	


the ANZ file relating to the loan application for Ms Karim's purchase of the Auburn property, which included documents stating her yearly gross income and claiming that she was to receive an inheritance of approximately $280,000 which would be used to purchase the property, as well as supporting documents stating her employment, salary superannuation and taxable income, as well as Bank and legal documents, contractual documents in relation to the purchase of the property and receipts for cheques provided by various banks.

Email information from Colonial showing that Ms Karim was not recorded as having a superannuation account with it, as he had stated in her application;


	
	Mr Spark had also had regard to Information provided by the Australian Tax Office which showed that she had not been employed or earned the income which she had stated in her application. He had also considered information provided by Centrelink which disclosed that Ms Karim had been in receipt of carer payments at relevant times.
	
	
	It was on the basis of this information that Mr Sparks came to suspect that the advice she had provided for the purpose of the loan application to the ANZ was false.
	
	
	Mr Spark deposed to his experience that in the absence of a restraining order, it is possible for people to enter into unregistered mortgages in relation to real estate very quickly in order to defeat the operation of the Act. He also deposed to his view that, given the serious fraudulent nature of the criminal activity in which Mr Karim is apparently involved, that she should not be given notice of this application. That is a course available under the Act, although s 10A(4) permits a different course to be taken, if the Court thinks fit.
	
	
	Section 10A(5) requires the making of the orders sought under the Act, if the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the material which is relied on well establishes that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed and that the requirements of s 10A(5) of the Act have been addressed. In that situation, the Act requires that the orders sought in relation to the property in question be made. In the circumstances, I concluded that it was also appropriate to make the other orders sought.
	
	
	On the evidence, I am also satisfied that the Commission ought not to be required to give notice of this application and that it should be dealt with ex parte. In coming to that view, I had regard to the provisions of s 10C of the Act, which permits an affected person to apply to have a restraining order set aside, as well as the liberty granted in the order to the parties to apply to the Court on three days’ notice.
	


Orders


	
	I accordingly make orders in the terms sought, as well as ordering that the Commission serve a copy of this judgment on Ms Karim. Those orders are:
	


“Upon the Plaintiff giving the usual undertaking as to damages (the giving of which by its solicitor is noted) and

Considering that, having had regard to the matters contained in the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 4 December 2015, there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions stated therein

		01 February 2016",2015-12-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768422,Ramos v R [2015] NSWCCA 313,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: The applicant, David Joshua Ramos, was sentenced on 11 December 2012 for various offences, to each of which he had entered a plea of guilty, resulting in a non-parole period of 14 years with a balance of term of five years. The applicant was one of three co-offenders sentenced together by Johnson J in the Common Law Division. [1]  The most serious offence was one of murder. The application for leave to appeal was directed primarily to the sentence imposed for that offence.
	
	
	The sentence for murder involved a non-parole period of 12 years, commencing on 22 July 2012 with a balance of term of five years, giving an overall sentence of 17 years imprisonment. The applicant did not participate in the physical attack on the deceased; rather, he was the driver of a vehicle which transported those directly involved in the assault to the premises where the assault took place and drove them away after the event. The combination of a lengthy sentence and the room for debate as to an appropriate sentence for murder where culpability is based on circumstances commonly referred to as “extended joint criminal enterprise” warrant a grant of leave to appeal. For the reasons explained below, the appeal should be allowed.
	


Factual background


	
	The factual circumstances relating to the applicant’s offences have been carefully set out in the judgment of the sentencing judge and need not be repeated, except to the extent necessary to address the issues raised on the appeal.
	
	
	The primary sources are twofold. First, there was an agreed statement of facts with respect to the applicant tendered at his committal for sentence on 4 July 2012. One difficulty in using that statement is that, while it is clear that many of the events and conversations took place when the applicant was not present, the statement did not make clear precisely what the applicant knew as to those events and conversations. The second source of information was evidence given by the applicant at the hearing on sentence on 30 and 31 October 2012.
	
	
	The offending in which the applicant was involved occurred between 29 June 2010 and 2 July 2010. The applicant was arrested on 22 July 2010. The activities were carried out by a group who called themselves the United Brotherhood, most of whom were young men in their early twenties or, in two cases under 18 and in the case of the applicant a few months over 18. The leader of the group, John Khoury was 29 years at the time of the offences. The modus operandi of the group appeared to be carrying out home invasions of persons believed to have drugs or significant sums of money on their premises. One of the group was Richard Vergara who was a friend of the applicant and a co-offender, known as MA. The applicant and MA were also friends, the applicant having been at the same school as MA, but a year ahead of him. The members of the group referred to Khoury’s home as “the compound”, as did the applicant in his evidence. At the time that the applicant was recruited to join in the activities of the group, he was allowed to drive a Toyota Tarago which belonged to his father.
	
	
	On Tuesday, 29 June 2010 Khoury and his lieutenants, Ray Tuki, Mohammad Karimi and Anaterea Tamapua, planned a home invasion at premises owned by the uncle of an ex-girlfriend of Khoury. The purpose was to steal firearms held in a safe in the uncle’s home in Lakemba, including a Desert Eagle, two Berettas and a Glock. Tamapua identified the applicant and Vergara as persons present at the meeting at the compound when Khoury gave the group a large serrated machete and a sawn-off .22 calibre rifle for the invasion. Two vehicles were taken, the applicant carrying five members of the group, while Tamapua went with Khoury and his then girlfriend. Vergara had the rifle, which was loaded. Four members of the group approached the house, one of the others having the machete and a third carrying a bag for the proceeds of the proposed robbery. However, the robbery did not proceed because, as Vergara told Karimi, “there were three boys and two girls in the house and they thought they were outnumbered.” They were sent back by Karimi, but the occupants had apparently left the house and the home invasion was abandoned for a second time. These events were the subject of a charge of conspiracy to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon included on a Form 1 and taken into account in sentencing the applicant on the murder charge.
	
	
	On returning to the compound, the group was then directed to go to an address in Ashcroft, being a residence occupied by a married couple and their teenage children. When the male occupant, James Stiff, opened the door, he was immediately assaulted by Vergara with a machete. When Stiff put up his left arm to protect himself he received a deep cut to the forearm and started to bleed profusely. The robbery netted 7 grams of cannabis and a school computer stolen from one of the children.
	
	
	When giving evidence at the sentencing hearing about the events at Ashcroft, the applicant’s counsel asked him, “You knew the men were armed with machetes?”, to which the applicant answered “Yep.” [2]  Further, the agreed facts stated: [3] 
	


“As they drove back to the compound, Vergara smiled and laughed when he told the others in Ramos’ Tarago how he ‘chopped’ the male victim in the arm.”


	
	The events at Ashcroft were the subject of a charge of specially aggravated break, enter and steal, for which the applicant was sentenced to four years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of three years to commence from the date of his arrest, namely 22 July 2010.
	
	
	Khoury ran a business, involving the sale of mobile phones and various accessories and implements. On the day after the Ashcroft offence, 30 June 2010, a group including the applicant met at Khoury’s shop to discuss plans for further home invasions. Ramos and MA collected Tamapua and Vergara in the Tarago and went to Khoury’s shop in Chester Hill. Two female members of the group left the premises but became involved in a confrontation with two males. Tamapua and other members of the group confronted the males and a brawl eventuated. Police then went to Khoury’s shop and arrested a number of persons in the shop, including the applicant. He said they were taken to Bankstown Police Station. [4]  On being released, they went to the compound, where the rifle was taken from a cupboard, cleaned and handled by members of the group.
	
	
	The next offence was planned for 1 July 2010 involving premises at Warwick Farm. Vergara arranged for the applicant (who appeared to have been expecting the call) to go to the compound with the Tarago. The group congregated at Khoury’s shop shortly before 10pm. After the applicant and MA arrived at the shop, four members of the group were allocated to carry out the offences, with the applicant as the driver and Tamapua and Karimi going along to identify the address and oversee the job. Each of the four members were given an Elephant brand meat cleaver as a weapon. They then went to an address in Warwick Farm where a drug dealer known as “beanie boy” was believed to live. The four men with the weapons were told to go and scare him a bit and take whatever drugs he had. The men entered a unit occupied by a mother with two daughters who were threatened with the meat cleavers. The men demanded drugs, but obtained nothing, except a laptop computer which they stole. (The intended victim lived in the unit next door.)
	
	
	The applicant was charged in respect of this offence with robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, being sentenced to 5.5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years.
	
	
	On the same night, the group went to Lurnea to commit a second home invasion which had been planned at the same time as the Warwick Farm job. With the applicant driving, they went first to an address in Granville to find out the address of the proposed victim, another dealer in cannabis.
	
	
	The premises at Lurnea were occupied by Tracey Burgess (who was 47 years of age), Kesley Burgess (25 years) and his girlfriend, and another male aged 56 years. Ms Burgess’ second son and intended victim, Jacob Burgess (20 years) was not at home. When a member of the group knocked on the door, the male friend, thinking that it was Jacob, opened the latch, at which point one of the men flung the door open, knocking the male over; four of the group then entered the home.
	
	
	Seeing four men enter the home with large meat cleavers, Tracey Burgess ran to her son’s bedroom and asked him to let her in. She was chased by a co-offender identified as Tomasi Natuba. Natuba threatened Tracey Burgess with a meat cleaver, demanding drugs and cash. At one point he swung the weapon at her; it glanced off the palm of her hand before the weapon wedged in the laundry door. Natuba pulled the meat cleaver free and started smashing items on bookshelves in the hallway. Kesley Burgess armed himself with a large kitchen knife and lunged at Natuba, stabbing him in the shoulder. Other members of the group then attacked Kesley Burgess; one of the co-offenders, Byquar, struck his own foot, causing a deep gash. Kesley Burgess was viciously attacked, suffering eight incised wounds, to his lower left forearm, his left wrist and right wrist (each of which severed arteries), his left calf (also causing arterial damage), his left mid-thigh and both buttocks. He died in hospital as a consequence of the loss of blood at about 9.15pm on 2 July 2010.
	
	
	Before the men left, Tracey Burgess threw a tin containing a small amount of cannabis at one of the males, while another grabbed her handbag which contained her wallet and other personal effects. MA, Byquar and Natuba got into the applicant’s Tarago. The group reassembled some time later at Khoury’s shop.
	
	
	The applicant and Vergara then drove Natuba to Bankstown Hospital for him to get medical treatment for his wounded shoulder. They devised a story that he would tell the police that he had been “jumped” in Bankstown and had rung his mate (the applicant) to come and take him to hospital. He made a call to the applicant’s phone number to support the story. After being told that the police had arrived at the hospital, the applicant and Vergara were directed to return to Khoury’s shop. The applicant dropped four members of the group at separate addresses.
	
	
	The events at Lurnea and the death of Kesley Burgess were the subject of the charge of murder. The events of that evening also gave rise to a charge of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, an offense which was contained on the Form 1 and taken into account with respect to the conviction for murder.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	The applicant was sentenced by Johnson J on 11 December 2012. The grounds of appeal appear in an application for leave to appeal filed on 27 May 2015. The delay of some 2.5 years was not explained, but it appears that the applicant obtained the benefit of numerous extensions of time to permit the application to be brought. There were two grounds of appeal identified in the notice, namely:
	



	
	His Honour erred in his assessment of the applicant’s objective culpability. In the alternative, his Honour failed to give proper effect to the parity principle when sentencing the applicant having regard to the sentences imposed on MA and Byquar for the offence of murder.
	
	
	His Honour erred in failing to give proper effect to his finding of special circumstances.
	



	
	The first element of the first ground relied upon the fact that the applicant was the driver, whereas the two co-offenders sentenced with him had entered the Burgess house and one (Byquar) had inflicted wounds on the deceased. The second element of the first ground required a comparison of the sentences imposed on each offender charged with the murder.
	
	
	Whereas the sentences for each of the other offences reflected participation in a joint criminal enterprise, the attack resulting in death, although foreseen by the applicant as a possible consequence of the joint criminal enterprise, was not within the criminal purpose. On the other hand, because Byquar actually inflicted serious harm on the victim his liability for murder was that of a principal.
	
	
	The second ground raises a more limited issue relating to the relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term. While a finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”) allows the court to reduce the non-parole period so as to increase the balance of term beyond the proportion permitted by the section, the exercise must be undertaken for the purpose of allowing a longer period of supervised release. That purpose will be based on considerations specific to the individual.
	


Sentences imposed and conduct of each offender


	
	To consider how these matters should properly have affected the sentencing of the applicant, it is necessary to identify the sentences imposed on MA and Byquar. Each entered a plea of guilty to the charge of murder and each received a 25% discount for the plea. Each also obtained the benefit of a finding of special circumstances for the purpose of s 44. As has been noted, the applicant was sentenced to 17 years with a non-parole period of 12 years. MA was sentenced to imprisonment for 20 years with a non-parole period of 14 years. Byquar was sentenced to imprisonment for 23 years with a non-parole period of 16 years.
	
	
	A further method of comparison involved looking at the undiscounted starting point of each sentence which was, in the case of Byquar, 30 years 8 months (with a non-parole period of 21 years 4 months); in the case of MA, 26 years 8 months (with a non-parole period of 18 years 8 months) and in the case of the applicant, 22 years 8 months (with a non-parole period of 16 years). Not being an adult at the time of the offending, MA was not subject to a standard non-parole period; in the case of the others, the standard non-parole period was 20 years. [5]  The disparities may thus be identified as three year steps with respect to the total sentence and two year steps with respect to the non-parole period which, in each case, constituted approximately 70% of the total sentence. The disparities appear greater if regard is had to the undiscounted starting points for each sentence: the sentences, in the same order, decrease by steps of four years and, with respect to the non-parole periods, two years nine months.
	
	
	In considering the roles played by MA and Byquar in the events at the Burgess home, two principal circumstances were identified. First, each entered the home with a meat cleaver; secondly, while Byquar was actively involved in striking the deceased from behind, MA did not use his meat cleaver to attack. On the other hand, the sentencing judge found that MA “willingly participated in the offence” and did nothing “to suggest withdrawal from the house or desisting from any attack or continued attack upon Kesley Burgess by others.” [6]  Of the applicant, the sentencing judge stated: [7] 
	


“Ramos did not enter the premises of any home invaded by his co-offenders. He did not see them in action inside the houses. However, he heard what was said as his co-offenders emerged from the premises on each occasion, and he was aware of the distribution of meat cleavers for use in the crimes. He saw bloodied persons and items leaving the Burgess house. He nevertheless continued his assistance to his co-offenders.”


	
	The reference to hearing what his co-offenders had said included, following the Ashcroft offence, Vergara boasting about chopping one of the victims. Although MA clearly had an opportunity to withdraw, or intervene to stop the attack, when the joint enterprise escalated to a vicious attack on Kesley Burgess, the applicant had no such opportunity, not being in the house or knowing what was occurring. On the other hand, the judge recounted MA’s agreed admission, “I saw someone get hacked last night … I seen it happen in front of me. I was in shock”. [8]  Thus, in a practical sense MA’s opportunity to withdraw was limited.
	
	
	Before turning to the personal circumstances of each offender, a factor relevant to the comparison between the sentences imposed, it is convenient to identify the principles which may be applied in assessing the objective elements of the offence of murder, as it affected each offender.
	


Joint enterprise liability


	
	In considering the position of individuals involved in a joint criminal enterprise, it is important to distinguish between responsibility and culpability. The law imposes responsibility where the accused has a particular state of mind and undertakes particular acts; culpability is an assessment of moral blameworthiness. If, in a moral sense, the accused is not seen to be blameworthy (or sufficiently blameworthy to be guilty of a particular crime) that may provide a basis for criticising the level of responsibility imposed by the criminal law. However, it is not a reason for the sentencing court to impose a sentence appropriate to a lesser offence than that for which the offender was, it must be accepted, properly convicted.
	
	
	That is not to say that moral blameworthiness (culpability) is not relevant to sentencing; it is central to that exercise. Nevertheless, the limits on the sentencing discretion are imposed by the offence for which the person has been convicted.
	
	
	This reasoning is important in a case such as the present where the offender is convicted of murder, but based on the principles of extended joint criminal enterprise. However far, physically and in terms of awareness, the offender may have been removed from the act of killing, the law says that he or she is responsible for it. That leads to a dilemma: the law prescribes a maximum penalty for murder (life imprisonment) and, in the case of the applicant, a standard non-parole period (20 years). Because of the broad range of circumstances that can result in a conviction for murder, it is by no means easy to characterise where particular circumstances fall on a scale of culpability; nor is it easy to assess culpability where the law ascribes to the offender’s conduct a particular level of criminality, namely, in this case, murder.
	
	
	Indeed, the term “culpability” refers to only part of the sentencing process. As explained by Gibbs CJ in Lowe v The Queen: [9] 
	


“It is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal, and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender, and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence, have to be taken into account.”

Objective seriousness of applicant’s conduct

(a)   principles of appellate review


	
	The first complaint raised on the appeal was a challenge to the assessment by the sentencing judge of the objective seriousness of the applicant’s conduct.
	
	
	Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) provides that if the court is of opinion that “some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed” it is obliged to quash the sentence and pass such other sentence. Although the power conferred on the court by s 6(3) is stated succinctly and in neutral terms, a constrained approach has generally been followed with respect to some aspects of the sentencing process. Because, following the decision in the High Court of Carroll v The Queen, [10]  there has been discussion in this Court as to the proper course to be taken in considering a challenge to the characterisation adopted by the sentencing judge of the objective seriousness of the offender’s conduct, [11]  it is convenient to restate the relevant principles.
	
	
	Section 6(3) is silent as to whether the appellate court is required to identify error and, if so as to the kind of error which is sufficient to warrant intervention. However, with respect to a judicial function requiring an evaluative assessment of the culpability of an offender and the characterisation of the conduct constituting the offence, the court should only interfere in accordance with the principles established almost 80 years ago in House v The King. [12]  That case requires the establishment of error, including any error of law, or mistaking the facts. In language which foreshadowed that used in relation to legal error of an administrative decision in the absence of reasons, [13]  the Court recognised that even if the error did not appear in the judgment, “if upon the facts [the result] is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance.”
	
	
	Where, as in this case, comprehensive reasons have been given, this last principle is unlikely to be engaged. Thus, if error is to be identified in the present case, it should be possible to point to some aspect of the reasoning of the sentencing judge, including by way of omission, reflecting error.
	
	
	On the other hand, it may be said that characterisation of the objective seriousness of the offending, being an evaluative judgment, is not readily explained or justified by a precise reasoning process. As explained by Spigelman CJ in Mulato v Regina, [14]  the question for the appellate court must be whether or not the particular characterisation which the sentencing judge gave to the circumstances of the offence was open. In the same case, Simpson J noted that such an assessment was “reviewable in this Court only on the principle stated in House v The King”. [15]  That proposition is not to be doubted; however, Simpson J further suggested that the principle of constraint was based on what were correctly identified as the separate roles of the first instance judge and the appellate court.
	
	
	These statements of the principle of restraint were repeated by Bathurst CJ in Regina v KB, [16]  continuing at [53]:
	


“This is particularly so in the case of an offence of this nature which can occur in a very wide variety of different circumstances. That is not to say that appellate courts should not intervene once they have reached a concluded view that the sentencing judge was in error in his or her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. However, the approach in Mulato …, emphasises the need for caution in reaching such a view and the importance of paying due regard to the opinion of the sentencing judge.”


	
	The question raised in recent authority is whether the constrained approach adopted in Mulato and cases referring to it is consistent with the following proposition stated in Carroll at [24]:
	


“In deciding whether the sentence passed by the primary judge was manifestly inadequate it was open to the Court of Criminal Appeal to consider how the appellant's offending was properly to be characterised. In particular, it was open to the Court of Criminal Appeal to form a view different from the primary judge about where, on an objective scale of offending, the appellant's conduct stood.”


	
	There is, however, no reason to suppose that this language intended any departure from established principle. Carroll involved an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions against the leniency of a sentence, on the single ground of manifest inadequacy. As the High Court stated at [4]:
	


“The determinative issue in this Court is whether the majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in concluding that the sentence imposed by the primary judge was manifestly inadequate. The division of opinion in the Court of Criminal Appeal on that question hinged about differing assessments of the objective gravity of the offence. And, of course, the adequacy of the sentence passed on the appellant could not be determined without close attention to that issue.”


	
	After setting out the statutory provision relevant to a prosecution appeal (s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act), the joint judgment continued at [7]:
	


“It has long been established [17]  that ‘[i]nadequacy of sentence, an expression not found in the Criminal Appeal Act ... is not satisfied by a mere disagreement by the Court of Appeal with the sentence actually imposed’. [18]  Rather, as pointed out in Dinsdale v The Queen, [19]  error must first be identified by the appellate court. And as was held in House v The King, [20]  an appeal against an exercise of discretion, in this case a sentencing discretion, is governed by established principles.”


	
	Although in Carroll the error on the part of the Court of Criminal Appeal was intervening in respect of findings of fact which had not been challenged on appeal, there can be no doubt that the principles to be applied were those laid down in House v The King. Nor could Mulato properly involve any qualification or departure from those principles laid down by the High Court. Accordingly, the question is whether the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending in the present case was shown to be outside the range properly available to the sentencing judge, bearing in mind that the reasonableness of the range should not be too readily confined, nor error too easily inferred.
	


(b)   assessing objective seriousness


	
	The principal argument articulated for the applicant was that the sentencing judge failed to identify the applicant’s involvement in the killing as based on the principle of extended joint criminal enterprise. That is, the common purpose of the offenders did not extend to the infliction of grievous bodily harm or fatal injury on any person, but the possibility of such conduct occurring was within the contemplation of the parties to the joint enterprise. [21] 
	
	
	It is true that the sentencing judge did not use the phrase “extended joint criminal enterprise”, nor did he analyse the conduct of the three offenders before him in those terms. Nevertheless, no other basis for sentencing could fairly be derived from the reasons. Thus, in describing the proposed offending, the judge noted that “[t]he intended purpose of the offence was to target Jacob Burgess, and to forcefully steal drugs and money from him using weapons.” [22]  There was no suggestion that the common purpose was to inflict grievous bodily harm or to kill. It is in that context that the following passage should be understood:
	


“[224]   Concerning the murder charge, then, the present offenders include those in the house who struck Kesley Burgess with machetes (Byquar), those in the house who did not strike him (MA) and those outside the house who had assisted and remained willing to assist in the commission of offences (Ramos).

[225]   Although it cannot be said that any person intended to inflict grievous bodily harm or death to Kesley Burgess until he armed himself to challenge the intruders, events that followed saw persons striking Kesley Burgess in a manner demonstrative at least of an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, if not death.”


	
	It is clear from this passage that the applicant could only have been party to a common purpose which did not include the elements of murder. In dealing with the applicant’s circumstances, the trial judge stated:
	


“[235]   Ramos did not enter the premises of any home invaded by his co-offenders. He did not see them in action inside the houses. However, he heard what was said as his co-offenders emerged from the premises on each occasion, and he was aware of the distribution of meat cleavers for use in the crimes. He saw bloodied persons and items leaving the Burgess house. He nevertheless continued his assistance to his co-offenders.

[236]   Ramos was involved in the enterprise from 29 June 2010, commencing with the provision of transport for the conspiracy to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon (the Form 1 offence), followed by the Ashcroft offence and, the next night, the Warwick Farm offence and then the invasion of the Burgess house leading to the murder of Kesley Burgess.”


	
	It is apparent from the manner in which the sentencing judge dealt with the conduct and involvement of each of the offenders separately that he expressly took into account the different bases upon which they were guilty of murder. No factual error was identified in his description of the applicant’s conduct. Nor was his assessment merely descriptive; it included evaluative considerations appropriate to a comparative exercise which, in due course, was undertaken. Thus, although noting that the applicant became involved “at the request of others because he had available to him a large vehicle which could be used as a type of people mover for the planned home invasions”, the judge also noted that the vehicle was “an important part of the enterprise.” [23]  He also said: [24] 
	


“Ramos was criminally involved in the enterprise over what was, comparatively speaking, an extended period. Even allowing for the view that he felt himself, in a sense, trapped in the situation, this was a serious course of criminal conduct.”


	
	Finally, the judge accepted that the applicant displayed “a lesser level of criminality” than the other two offenders before him for sentencing, stating that “[i]t was more serious to enter premises and threaten (and harm) persons than to wait outside in a car”. [25] 
	
	
	Where a standard non-parole period is to be taken into account, a sentencing judge may adopt the statutory language of offences “in the middle of the range of objective seriousness”. [26]  In this case, the sentencing judge did not do this, being more concerned with the relativities as between each of the three offenders before him, and as between those offenders and others involved in the events, including some who had been sentenced, and some who were awaiting trial. Indeed, the applicant criticised the reasons for spending more time analysing the conduct of other offenders in the group who had not been charged with murder, than comparing the respective roles of the offenders then before the court.
	
	
	There was no complaint that the judge did not seek to place the applicant’s conduct above or below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. A finding that an offence is in (or outside) the middle of the range of objective seriousness can be of limited assistance and usually involves a high degree of imprecision. The assessment of the applicant’s conduct was neither inaccurate nor, taken in isolation, outside the appropriate range for assessment of objective seriousness. The first limb of the first ground cannot be upheld in its terms. However, it will be appropriate to return shortly to the weight given by the judge to the assessment of the starting point for conduct of this kind, when taken into account with the applicant’s favourable personal circumstances.
	


(c)   assessing disparities


	
	The second limb involved a complaint as to what was described as “parity” but was better identified as an inadequate level of disparity.
	
	
	It was clear that the conduct of Byquar was by far the most culpable of the three. He knocked at the front door of the Burgess home and entered immediately the door was opened. He was directly involved with the attack on Kesley Burgess. Thus, after Kesley Burgess had struck Natuba in the shoulder, Byquar hit him from behind and later slashed at him again, although he missed and struck his own foot. As the judge noted, “there is little difference objectively between the striking of machete blows with intent to cause grievous bodily harm or intent to kill.” [27]  By contrast, although MA entered the premises with a meat cleaver and intimidated the occupants, he did not use the meat cleaver to strike anyone. [28]  He was thus an active participant in the house, who did not seek to withdraw or intervene when Kesley Burgess was attacked, but also did not get involved in the attack.
	
	
	There was a separate issue raised with respect to the applicant, who gave evidence of “an element of fear affecting his decision to continue his involvement in these criminal activities, even though no direct threat had been made to him”. [29]  The judge accepted that the applicant found himself in a “position from which it was difficult to extricate himself, given the serious violent criminal activities being carried out by those with whom he was involved.” The judge did not accept, however, that there was any element of duress or pressure sufficient to “significantly reduce his criminality”, finding that he was “aware that serious crimes of violence were being committed and there were clear opportunities for him to withdraw from the process, and not continue to make available his father’s Tarago vehicle.” [30] 
	
	
	On one view, the level of variation in the sentences noted above [31]  might be seen as reflecting the respective levels of objective seriousness of the conduct of each. In assessing the sentences imposed, it is, of course, necessary also to factor in the personal circumstances of the separate participants, as explained in Lowe and by Spigelman CJ in R v JW. [32] 
	


(d)   assessing subjective circumstances


	
	Turning to the subjective circumstances, disparities may be noted between the circumstances of the offenders which tended to accentuate their disparate roles in the offending.
	
	
	The sentencing took place some two years and three months after the commission of the offences. Their ages at the time of the offending were 17 years 8 months (MA), 18 years 7 months (the applicant) and 18 years 11 months (Byquar). Reports on each indicated a greater level of maturity developed whilst in custody and a degree of insight into his offending.
	
	
	Both MA and Byquar had prior criminal histories, each being on conditional liberty, in the case of MA as the result of a probation order and in the case of Byquar as a result of a parole order, at the time of the further offending. With respect to Byquar, the judge noted that his early response to his offences was “hardly indicative of contrition and remorse” but that during his period in custody he had developed “some insight, and a measure of contrition”. [33]  With respect to MA, the judge found that he too had developed “a level of insight” and “a level of contrition and remorse”. [34]  These were favourable findings, but expressed in muted terms.
	
	
	The findings with respect to the applicant were markedly different. The applicant had no prior criminal history, he had a “stable family upbringing until his parents separated in 2009”, following which misbehaviour at school led to him being asked to leave. [35]  He then undertook TAFE studies and was on vacation in the course of those studies when the offending occurred.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence of contrition and remorse which the sentencing judge accepted as genuine. [36]  The judge concluded:
	


“[217]   In addition, I am satisfied that Ramos has good prospects of rehabilitation. Although he had displayed some antisocial conduct prior to his involvement in these offences, he had no prior criminal history. These most serious offences constitute his first involvement with the criminal justice system.

[218]   The evidence of Ramos, his sister and the documentary material provides a solid foundation for conclusions favourable to him in the area of rehabilitation. The principal difficulty for him will be the length of time for which he will remain in custody, given the gravity of the offences for which he is to be sentenced.”


	
	It is a basic element of the principle of equal treatment according to the law that like cases be treated alike and cases which are materially different be treated differently “according to differences between them relevant to the scope, purpose and subject matter of the law.” [37]  The question is, therefore, whether the material differences between the circumstances and the conduct of the applicant and the other offenders were adequately reflected in the differential sentences imposed upon him, MA and Byquar.
	
	
	The applicant accepted that there were differences in the sentences, but, it was submitted, they did not differ “by a substantial margin.” That submission is difficult to accept and may depend upon the comparison being undertaken. If, as seems appropriate, the comparison should be between the undiscounted starting point for each sentence, the difference between the sentence imposed on the applicant and that imposed on Byquar is eight years and the difference between that imposed on MA and that imposed on the applicant is four years. These are not insignificant periods. On the other hand, the discounted non-parole periods, reflecting the minimum periods to be served in custody, involve differentials of four years and two years respectively. On the last calculation, the applicant would expect to serve a non-parole period being 75% of that imposed on Byquar and 86% of that imposed on MA.
	
	
	No specific calculation or comparison is determinative; further, the applicant must establish that the differential was so inadequate as to take it outside the range reasonably available to the sentencing judge, on the basis of the findings made which are either not challenged or the challenges to which have been rejected.
	
	
	Before concluding the analysis, it is convenient to turn to the second ground of the appeal, namely failing to give proper effect to the finding of special circumstances.
	


(e)   finding of special circumstances


	
	The finding of special circumstances with respect to the applicant, was based on the necessary accumulation of sentences for the different offences, together with the fact that he would have to serve a lengthy sentence as his first sentence of imprisonment. [38]  Similar findings were made with respect to the co-offenders, although, with respect to Byquar, the basis of the finding was limited to the effect of accumulation, whereas in respect of MA, it was said to be both the effect of accumulation and “having regard to MA’s youth”. [39] 
	
	
	A common purpose for a finding of special circumstances under s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, in cases where there has been an accumulation, is to provide an overall sentencing regime within which the non-parole period bears a relationship equivalent to that required for each sentence with respect to the balance of term. In other words, absent any other consideration, the accumulation of the longest sentence on earlier sentences will result in the balance of term being less than one-third of the combined non-parole periods. On one view, primary consideration appears to have been given to the effect of accumulation as a similar proportion was allowed for each offender. On that view, the allowance made for the fact that this would be the applicant’s first term of imprisonment was said to be inadequate.
	
	
	In its terms, this submission should not be accepted. There is a wealth of consistent authority at least doubting whether “the age and lack of antecedents of an offender and the fact that the sentence is one involving a first occasion of custody are, of themselves, special circumstances within the meaning of the legislation.” [40]  In R v Kaliti, Woods CJ at CL, referring to the last quotation, stated: [41] 
	


“[11]   I share that doubt, save to the extent that in an appropriate case, those circumstances may be reasons why, in conjunction with the remaining subjective circumstances, an assessment was justified that the applicant required a longer period than usual subject to a supervised release. …

…

[13]   Where special help is needed to overcome an alcohol or drug problem, or where some form of psychiatric assistance is needed to deal with the underlying circumstances which generate those problems, and where that help cannot adequately be provided within the corrective system, or where it would require an extended period of release subject to supervision, then it may be accepted that special circumstances do exist.”


	
	The question raised by this ground is, therefore, whether a lengthier period on parole would necessarily be beneficial for the applicant’s rehabilitation. As a practical matter it is unlikely that supervision would extend beyond some three years after release. The balance of term fixed by the sentencing judge was five years. It was open to the sentencing judge to consider that after 14 years in custody (or a little less if that period were to be reduced) a period of five years on parole was sufficient. No basis for extending the period of supervised release was identified.
	
	
	There is no doubt that the sentencing judge took into account the subjective circumstances concerning the applicant which have been noted above. Those included his age, his lack of criminal history and his progress in custody. In formulating the sentence, the judge noted that his subjective circumstances operated in his favour “in a manner greater than the other offenders.” [42]  That included giving greater weight in his case to “youth and immaturity”. As with the objective seriousness of the offending, the question is whether the sentence imposed for the murder took sufficient account of these favourable relative considerations.
	


Conclusions as to substance of appeal


	
	The grounds of appeal invited the Court to consider the assessment by the sentencing judge of the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending, the relativity of the sentences imposed on each of the three offenders and the subjective circumstances of the applicant, both in their own terms and in a comparative sense. Having regard to the combined effect of those considerations, in my view the starting point was excessive. That is, disregarding the discount for the plea of guilty, the sentencing judge needed to give proper weight to the following considerations, namely that:
	



	
	the applicant was party to a joint criminal enterprise involving robberies undertaken with weapons (meat cleavers), with the awareness that, no doubt if resistance were met, the meat cleavers might be used to inflict grievous bodily harm or even possibly to kill a person;
	
	
	nevertheless, the joint criminal enterprise did not extend to such conduct which occurred inside the victim’s home when the applicant was not present and of which he had no immediate knowledge;
	
	
	although his conduct in driving the vehicle was an important element in executing the joint criminal enterprise, he did not physically invade any person’s home or threaten or intimidate any person;
	
	
	his role as driver was that of a loyal participant, but not an organiser or planner;
	
	
	the sentence imposed, taken in combination with the other sentences for conduct occurring within a matter of days before the murder, would be his first period of imprisonment;
	
	
	he was, at the time of the offending, 18 years 7 months, and
	
	
	the judge accepted his expressions on oath of contrition and remorse and found that he had good prospects of rehabilitation.
	



	
	A combination of these circumstances should, without in anyway diminishing the horrendous behaviour inside the Burgess home, or the pointless and vicious killing of Kesley Burgess, have warranted a starting point in sentencing the applicant significantly less than 22 years and 8 months.
	
	
	Although the maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment, and the standard non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness is 20 years, a further indicator of the level of sentence which can be derived from the standard non-parole period is that, when account is taken of the relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term provided in s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, a standard non-parole period will involve a balance of term of 6 years 8 months and an overall sentence of 26 years and 8 months.
	
	
	Taking these various factors into account, together with the two further matters referred to on the Form 1, an appropriate starting point would have been 19 years and an unadjusted non-parole period of 14 years 3 months. Taking the plea into account would give a discounted sentence of 14 years 3 months. Adopting the same proportion of the sentence to be a minimum period of custody as that used by the sentencing judge (that is 70%) would result in a non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	Accordingly, the Court should make the following orders:
	



	
	Grant the applicant leave to appeal with respect to the sentence for the murder imposed by Johnson J on 11 December 2012.
	
	
	Set aside the sentence imposed for the murder and in place thereof sentence the applicant for the murder of Kesley Burgess at Lurnea on 1 July 2010, taking into account the offences on the Form 1, to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 10 years, commencing on 22 July 2012 and expiring on 21 July 2022, with a balance of term of 4 years and 3 months commencing on 22 July 2022 and expiring on 21 October 2026.
	
	
	The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole is 21 July 2022.
	



	
	CAMPBELL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA and substantially with his Honour’s reasons. In particular, I agree that the factors identified at [67] (a) – (g) justify the conclusion that a lesser sentence than that imposed by the learned sentencing judge is warranted for reasons which follow.
	
	
	I am persuaded that the applicant has made good the second aspect of his first ground, that is, with respect, that the learned sentencing judge “failed to give proper effect to the parity principle” when sentencing the applicant.
	
	
	To Basten JA’s quotation from Lowe v The Queen at [31] above, I would add that the powers conferred on this court by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW):
	


“… are wide enough to empower the court in its discretion to reduce a sentence not in itself manifestly excessive in order to avoid a marked disparity with a sentence imposed on a co-offender … [and] the reason why the court interferes in such a case is that it considers the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done.”

I acknowledge that the operative sense of grievance must be assessed by “objective criteria”. It does not involve “a judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity”: Green at [31]; see also Lowe at 613; Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 323 and 338.


	
	In Postiglione Dawson and Gaudron JJ, with whom Kirby J formed the majority, said the following (at 302):
	


“If regard is had solely to the head sentences — twenty-five years in the case of Savvas, eighteen years in Postiglione's case — the difference may fairly be regarded as reflecting their different roles in the conspiracies in respect of which they were convicted and Postiglione's subsequent co-operation with police and prosecuting authorities. However, the head sentence is but one component of the sentences. A proper comparison involves a consideration of all components.

One component of each of the sentences involved in this case and one which is susceptible of easy comparison is the non-parole period.”

To similar effect, Kirby J said (at 338):

“The focus of the attention of an appellate court is not upon the nominal sentence but upon the actual punishment which it appears likely the prisoners in suggested comparison will undergo.”


	
	Without wishing to unnecessarily multiply references to authority, I also refer to Siganto v The Queen [1998] HCA 74; 194 CLR 656, where Gaudron J reiterated her position in Postiglione (at 670 [51]):
	


“Once it is appreciated that the principle of parity in sentencing is concerned with consistency in punishment, it is apparent that all components of a sentence must be taken into account to determine whether the principle has been violated, including the maximum and minimum periods of actual incarceration. That is so whether the question is that of parity between co-offenders or parity across the range of those convicted of the offence in question.” [Footnotes omitted]


	
	In my view, it was insufficient for the learned sentencing judge to adopt a starting point which, on its face, may have reflected the legitimate differences between the co-offenders in terms of culpability and subjective circumstances. It was necessary for “the principle of parity in sentencing” to be taken into account throughout the whole of the sentencing task. As Kirby J pointed out in Postiglione, after making the various adjustments that the instinctive synthesis calls for in a given case (at 341):
	


“… it still remains for the judge to look back at the product of these calculations and discounts. It is then that the sentencing judge must consider whether the resulting sentence needs further adjustment. It may do so because it is out of step with the parity principle requiring that normally like cases should be treated alike.”

And due allowance made for relevant differences.


	
	In my judgment, the learned sentencing judge failed to consider the application of the parity principle throughout the process; it was considered at the outset, but not at the end.
	
	
	As Basten JA has pointed out, the end result of this enterprise was a horrendous crime. Although the applicant’s liability arose on the extended operation of the joint criminal enterprise principle, his knowledge of what happened at Ashcroft proved that he must have contemplated the infliction of serious bodily injury by use of the meat cleavers at Lurnea as a very real possibility. It is this conclusion which makes him liable for the murder as a secondary party. But, as the learned sentencing judge fully appreciated, his culpability was less than the others being sentenced at the same time. And his subjective circumstances entitled him to greater leniency, so far as there was scope for it, than the others.
	
	
	Although I have concluded that it is the discounted sentence of each offender which throws up the relevant disparity, to cure that disparity, “looking back at the product of these calculations and discounts”, and as suggested by Basten JA, the starting point should be adjusted to produce the final sentence he has proposed, and thus eliminate the disparity.
	
	
	BUTTON J: I have had the benefit of reading the judgments of Basten JA and Campbell J in draft. Although I respectfully agree with much of what Basten JA has written, I do not consider that the sentence imposed upon the applicant should be the subject of interference by this Court. Because Basten JA has comprehensively dealt with all of the salient features of the matter, and because mine is a minority view, I can be brief.
	
	
	I gratefully adopt the conspectus of evidential and procedural matters provided by Basten JA, and shall not elaborate upon any aspect of them.
	
	
	I agree with Basten JA that the characterisation of the objective seriousness of the offence was open to the evaluative judgment of the learned sentencing judge, and that the first basis of ground one should be rejected. In that regard, I accept the submission of the applicant that he was to be sentenced for murder by way of the doctrine of extended joint criminal enterprise. I do not accept, however, that the learned sentencing judge was under any misapprehension about that fact, or failed to give it appropriate weight.
	
	
	I respectfully disagree with Campbell J that the applicant has demonstrated erroneous disparity, when one compares the sentence for the murder imposed upon him with the sentence for the murder imposed upon Byquar, and upon the juvenile MA. I consider that the level of differentiation in the sentences imposed upon the three of them was open to the discretion reposed in the learned sentencing judge, whether one focuses upon notional starting points or the ultimate sentences actually imposed. For that reason, I respectfully consider that the second basis of ground one should be rejected.
	
	
	I agree with Basten JA that the approach of the sentencing judge to the question of special circumstances does not bespeak error of itself. For that reason, I consider that ground two should be rejected.
	
	
	I respectfully disagree with the ultimate conclusion of Basten JA that the sentence imposed upon the applicant should be reduced on the basis that the starting point adopted by the sentencing judge was excessive. That is so for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, that proposition was not explicitly notified and pressed by the applicant as a ground of appeal.
	
	
	Secondly, I do not accept that the grounds focusing upon the characterisation of the objective seriousness of the offence; the sentences imposed upon the two co-offenders; and the approach to special circumstances can be “aggregated” to impugn successfully the sentence by way of its notional starting point. In other words, in light of my view that no individual ground should succeed, I do not consider that the whole of the grounds is greater than the sum of their parts.
	
	
	Thirdly, the murder – featuring as it did the hacking to death of a young man in his own home in the presence of his mother – was an exceptionally brutal offence.
	
	
	Fourthly, that offence occurred in the context of the applicant having previously involved himself in the activities of a criminal gang that made it its business to commit premeditated offences of ruthless violence.
	
	
	Fifthly, it may be accepted that, speaking generally and all other things being equal, sentences for offences that are established against a principal in the second degree by way of the doctrine of extended joint criminal enterprise may be expected to be shorter than sentences imposed upon a principle in the second degree whose liability is established by way of the doctrine of basic joint criminal enterprise, and also shorter than sentences imposed upon a principle in the first degree. However, each case depends very much upon its own facts.
	
	
	Here, pursuant to the doctrine of extended joint criminal enterprise, and by way of his plea of guilty to the offence of murder, the applicant accepted that he foresaw that there was a significant possibility that, in the course of the armed robbery of prohibited drugs and cash (the foundational offence of 1 July 2010 at Lurnea in which he had agreed), one of his co-offenders would do an act with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. That state of mind was established, at least very largely, by the fact that, less than 48 hours before, one of the members of the gang had used a machete almost to sever the arm of a victim of a very similar home invasion committed by the same gang. It will be recalled that, after the completion of that act, the co-offender who had done it saw fit to boast about it in the presence of the applicant. And it will also be recalled that, prior to the commencement of the armed home invasion that saw the deceased hacked to death, the applicant observed the distribution of the weapons of choice: meat cleavers.
	
	
	In other words, in the circumstances of this particular case, I consider that the moral culpability of this particular offender (even within the context of his liability being established by way of extended joint criminal enterprise) was extremely high, as a result of his state of specific knowledge of what could very well occur, even accepting that he did not agree in it.
	
	
	Sixthly, I have not overlooked the fact that the applicant was only some months beyond 18 years of age, the age of full adulthood for the purposes of the criminal law. Nor have I overlooked his absence of prior criminality before he fell in with his co-offenders; his remorse; his good prospects of rehabilitation; and the finding by the sentencing judge that the applicant involved himself in a situation from which he found it difficult to extricate himself. Those subjective features may lead one respectfully to regard the adoption by the sentencing judge of a starting point of a putative head sentence of 22 years 8 months as a stern approach.
	
	
	But it is one thing to characterise the starting point in that way; it is another to characterise the starting point as excessive, and manifestly so, to the point of it being beyond the legitimate exercise of the sentencing discretion. And it is yet another to be satisfied that the sentence of imprisonment for 17 years with a non-parole period of 12 years actually imposed upon the applicant for this murder demonstrates the same error. I am not satisfied of either of those propositions.
	
	
	In light of my opinion that the sentence should not be the subject of interference, the orders that I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

Introduction


	
	The applicant was convicted of two offences, the first committed on 24 March 2012 and the second on 26 August 2012. The first offence was a charge of breaking and entering a dwelling house with intent to commit larceny in circumstances of aggravation (being in company) and special aggravation (whilst armed with a firearm). The second offence was a charge of armed robbery. On 17 December 2013 the District Court imposed an aggregate sentence under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) of imprisonment for 11 years, with a non-parole period of 8 years 4 months. The indicative sentence for the first sentence was 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years 3 months and, in respect of the second, 6 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 9 months. On 4 July 2013 the applicant had been sentenced for a number of motor vehicle offences, the non-parole periods imposed in respect of two of which were accumulative periods of 6 months, giving an effective non-parole period of 8 months commencing on 27 October 2012 and concluding on 26 June 2013. The present sentences commenced on the expiration of this effective non-parole period. Since the conviction of the first offence followed a trial, no discount applied; however, the applicant pleaded guilty to the second offence on the first day of trial, and a 15 per cent deduction was applied and reflected in the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his sentence upon the following grounds –
	


Ground 1: The sentencing judge failed to give proper or adequate expression to his finding of special circumstances in relation to the aggregate sentence imposed.

Ground 2: The sentencing judge failed to have regard to his assessment that the applicant had been institutionalised when he found that special circumstances existed but “only marginally”.

Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in imposing the aggregate sentence which he did when regard is had to the excessive accumulation of the indicative sentences.

Objective circumstances


	
	A statement of agreed facts was tendered in the sentence proceedings which formed the basis of the primary judge’s findings of fact. The following account is taken from his Honour’s reasons for sentence. In respect of the first offence, the home in question was a three bedroom house in which resided the victim named in the indictment, his partner, his sister, mother and her partner. At about midnight on 24 March 2012 the victim and his partner were watching television, with the other occupants elsewhere in the house. The applicant and at least one other unknown male began to smash down the front door of the house, forcing it open. The main door and a screen were extensively damaged and almost removed from their hinges. The assailants entered the house. The victim had pushed his bed up against the back of the bedroom door and the applicant or his co-offender attempted to force entry by kicking and hitting the door, demanding that the victim open it. One of the men managed to kick through the lower portion; as his foot came through, the victim grabbed it and a short struggle ensued before the foot was retracted. The victim’s sister came out of her bedroom armed with an electric guitar with which she attacked the applicant and his accomplice as they attempted to force open the victim’s bedroom door. She raised the guitar above her head and ran towards them demonstrating, as the primary judge said, “considerable courage”. Her action forced the two men to retreat through the front door of the house where she saw someone near the front steps holding a firearm. At this point the victim emerged from his bedroom. The applicant and another man re-entered the house, one of them, either the applicant or an accomplice, now being armed with a long barrelled rifle which he raised with both hands and pointed directly at the victim. He grabbed his sister, pulled her into the lounge room and closed the door separating it from the hallway. The pair, together with their mother, barricaded the door and held it firm despite attempts to push it open. The victim called police on a mobile phone and told the attackers that police were on their way. In the meantime, the applicant and one of his accomplices gained entry to the victim’s bedroom and rummaged through the chest of drawers and various other areas of the bedroom. As it happened, the victim’s partner was still hiding in the room and, as the primary judge justifiably observed, must have been very frightened. The applicant and his accomplices fled the house shortly before police arrived. A number of fingerprints were located, one of which was the applicant’s. He was arrested on 27 October 2012 and declined to be interviewed. He pleaded not guilty, electing for trial by judge alone, but was convicted.
	
	
	The armed robbery committed on 26 August 2012 took place at a bowling club where one of the co-offenders, Scott Lynch, worked. He and one Hudson agreed to rob the club. A week before the robbery, Lynch, Hudson and the applicant travelled to just outside the club where Lynch indicated to the others the door that they should enter because it had no camera surveillance. He also told them where to go inside the club. On the day of the robbery Lynch obtained a pre-paid phone which was to be used to signal the other two as to when they should enter the club. An annual event was held at the club during the afternoon and evening of this day, which was one of the busiest in the year. At about 10pm, when trading ceased and the patrons left the club, it was secured. Shortly after, Lynch telephoned the other offenders who were waiting outside. About 20 minutes later, when he had almost completed emptying all the cash from the 31 poker machines in the club and the manager, Ms Stirrat, was working in the office area, amongst other things placing other money in the safe, the applicant and Hudson forced their way through the rear door, wearing balaclavas and gloves both armed with shotguns. They ran through the club into the poker machine area and pretended to hold up Lynch. He indicated the office area where Ms Stirrat was counting the money. The two men entered the office and confronted Ms Stirrat, telling her to sit down and remain still. They put cash from the open safe into bags, then returned to the poker machine section and took the money that Lynch had collected, together with his mobile phone. The two told Stirrat and Lynch to remain where they were and left the club. Something over $34,000 was stolen. Police were alerted and commenced investigations. Shortly after, a motor vehicle was found completely destroyed by fire and a shortened double barrelled shotgun about three metres away. About three or four days after the offence Lynch went to Hudson’s home, where the applicant was also present, and was given $4000 for his part in the crime. As the investigation proceeded, suspicions focussed on Lynch being one of the offenders and, on 8 November 2012, he was confronted by police with these suspicions. He admitted he was involved and participated in an electronic recorded interview in which he made full admissions implicating the applicant and Hudson. The applicant declined to be interviewed and was charged with armed robbery of the club on 27 November 2012. As I have mentioned, he pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial.
	


Criminal Record


	
	The applicant’s criminal record commences in 2006, shortly after he turned 20, when he was convicted on charges of aggravated assault, intent to rob and aggravated robbery, with two charges of robbery taken into account. He was sentenced on this occasion to an overall term of 3 years with an effective non-parole period of 18 months expiring on 14 September 2007. On 14 May 2008 he was sentenced for resisting police to 4 months imprisonment from 27 March 2008 and, for damaging property, to 4 months imprisonment (following appeal) which commenced on 26 March 2008. In May and September 2012, he was fined (respectively) for driving with a middle range PCA and possession of a prohibited drug. On 8 May 2012 a 6 months suspended sentence had been imposed, commencing on 8 May 2012, for driving whilst his licence was suspended. On 4 July 2013, having reoffended, he was called up and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment which commenced on 27 October 2012. On the same day he was also sentenced for dangerous driving and not stopping when pursued by police to 12 months imprisonment with a 6 months non-parole period which commenced on that date and also for driving whilst disqualified to 12 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months which commenced on 27 December 2012.
	
	
	It appears, therefore, that although the applicant had spent significant periods in prison after turning 20 years of age, he was at large from August 2008 to October 2012, with no offences on his record during that period.
	


Subjective features


	
	A psychologist’s report had been tendered on behalf of the applicant, which contained the following information under the heading “Criminal history” –
	


“Mr Laupama was first convicted of an offence in 2006 when he was 20 years of age. His offences since have been largely violent robberies, although he has also been charged with a destruction of property, resist arrest, driving while suspended, police pursuit, drug possession, drive while intoxicated and drive without a license. As a result of these convictions, Mr Laupama advised that he has been incarcerated for much of his adult life. Although he seems to have lived in the community for brief periods throughout his 20s, Mr Laupama advised that the longest he has been in the community was 12 months from the age of 24 or 25 to 26, when he was incarcerated on the current charges.”


	
	Although Mr Laupama was noted by the psychologist to be a “poor historian”, the history he gave was, in substance, accepted by her. However, it is not supported by the criminal record. Leaving aside the fact that he was at liberty for a significant period during his adulthood, the robberies were apparently committed in 2006 (he was charged in March and sentenced in October of that year) with no other like offences recorded.
	
	
	The psychologist noted other significant aspects of the applicant’s history, for example, that when the applicant was six years of age he was made a ward of the state (in New Zealand), residing in a “boys’ home” in harsh conditions, from which he absconded when he was 12 years old to find his family. He told the psychologist that he “continues to adhere to the rules common in institutional settings when he is living in the community”. She commented, “he is unsure and easily confused by daily tasks in the community; tasks and skills he has never had any particular need for or consistent exposure to… [which], given his long history of institutionalisation and lack of appropriate guidance… is unsurprising”. The applicant told the psychologist that he relies heavily on those around him for guidance and support and, when this is lacking, “he becomes emotionally unstable and he begins to engage in unhelpful behaviours… [including] criminal activities that will result in his incarceration”. He said that, during his last period of community living, he actively engaged in minor antisocial behaviours (such as riding his bicycle whilst intoxicated) so he would be incarcerated. He feels safer in custody when the pressures of reality are significantly reduced. The psychologist concluded, “Mr Laupama’s institutionalisation and his desire to remain in custody raises concern about his risk of reoffending and it is evident he will require significant support if he is to live successfully in the community post release”.
	
	
	The psychologist also reported a lengthy period of significant drug abuse.
	
	
	The apparent failure of the psychologist to raise with the applicant how he managed during the four years or so that he was in the community and the lack of information about how he coped at this time renders the conclusion about the effects of institutionalisation somewhat weaker. Nevertheless, the applicant’s family and developmental history as recounted to the psychologist is appalling; his parents relinquished care of him in his infancy and he was sent to live with various family members until he was six years of age, then (as I have mentioned) he was sent to a boys’ home, where the conditions were particularly harsh and it was necessary for him to steal food because he was not adequately fed; after he absconded, he lived with his aunt, who sent him to his mother but he found it difficult to reconnect with her and left after a month to live “on the streets”, engaging in criminal behaviour to support himself. He said to the psychologist that his antisocial behaviour resulted in periods of detention but, again, there is nothing in his record to support this until, as I have mentioned, his first offence shortly after his 20th birthday.
	
	
	With respect to his education, he told the psychologist that he attended many primary schools but was regularly suspended or expelled for misconduct, truanting regularly and failing to develop functional literacy skills, being still unable to read or write with any proficiency and struggling with comprehension and articulation. Although he went to secondary school, he was homeless during this period. He left school after gaining his School Certificate but was unsure if he passed or what grade he received. He was functionally illiterate. He worked for brief periods, first at the age of 13 and since then as a scaffolder, bricklayer, concreter, bobcat driver, forklift driver, fencer and as a dance teacher at a youth centre. In the months prior to his arrest he reported working as a dump truck driver in the mines. He said that he was able to develop the skills necessary to engage in work, although he had difficulty with following instructions and rapidly learning tasks. He left these jobs because he was required to undertake tests or complete forms. The psychologist observed that the applicant’s motivation to work is now low, indeed that he would prefer not to work because the challenges in the workplace “are too overwhelming for him”. Nonetheless, she observed, “employment and, importantly, the structure offered by work, will be beneficial in helping Mr Laupama achieve stability”. She recommended that he seek employment in a supported work environment where people are aware of his limitations. The applicant told the psychologist that he entered into a supportive relationship “soon after being released from custody at the age 24”, which enabled him to “avoid re-incarceration during the 12 months” it lasted. In several respects, however, the relationship was unhappy and ultimately his partner terminated the relationship after accusing the applicant of being unfaithful.
	
	
	Cognitive assessment demonstrated a verbal score that placed the applicant in the Extremely Low to Borderline range and at the first percentile. On the performance scale, his score was Extremely Low to Low Average range, only outperforming four per cent of his age related peers. Overall, his intelligence scores fell in the Extremely Low to Borderline range, in the first percentile. The psychologist noted, “he can be considered an individual of limited intellect and will likely struggle with self-regulation and self-monitoring”. These, and other tests, indicated that the applicant’s cognitive capacity is limited but “with learning, he is able to develop functional skills for living”. The applicant said that he had witnessed a number of shootings, including the shooting death of his brother and described ensuing symptoms consistent with chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
	
	
	The psychologist’s formulation concluded as follows –
	


“For Mr Laupama the custodial environment offers him the protection, structure and safety he requires to function and alleviates the pressure associated with the realities of life. Since entering custody, Mr Laupama’s mental health seems to have stabilised somewhat and this highlights further the deficits in his coping with community living. However, at present, there is still evidence of post-trauma and his low cognitive functioning will remain an ongoing concern. These factors combined with his history of antisocial behaviour will negatively impact his ability to function successfully in the community and avoid contact with the criminal justice system in the future.”

The primary judge’s reasons


	
	The applicant had given evidence in his trial. His defence amounted to saying that he had gone with his friends to obtain marijuana and was drunk at the time, otherwise denying that he committed the offence. The primary judge noted that the applicant was vague and slow in his responses to questions and appeared at times to have difficulty understanding them, although there was no evidence called to suggest that he suffered from a mental, intellectual or drug induced disability. During the sentence proceedings his Honour observed that the way in which the applicant gave his evidence during the trial confirmed many of the observations made by the psychologist.
	
	
	No objection was taken by the prosecutor to the tender of the psychologist’s report. Although in submissions it was noted that the history it contained came from the applicant, was not sworn or tested and was largely self-serving, the criminal history in it was not corrected. The prosecutor appeared to accept that the report set out the applicant’s dysfunctional upbringing which created great difficulties in enabling him to adjust to the demands of daily life. He pointed out that it was disturbing that the applicant’s position seemed to be that he preferred custody to being at liberty and, furthermore, appeared to be uninterested in obtaining employment on his release and the psychologist was guarded in relation to the issue of future offending.
	
	
	The primary judge did not express a conclusion about the objective criminality of the first offence in terms of where it stood in a range of seriousness, but noted the various factors that bore on this question. By contrast, his Honour held that the second offence was “below the objective medium criminality for this range of offences … certainly at the higher end of the lower range.” No issue is taken as to his Honour’s approach to objective seriousness in respect of either offence: both the grounds of the application and the submissions made to this Court focused on the non-parole period and the indicative overlap of the non-parole periods to reach the aggregate non-parole period of 8 years and 4 months, a complaint, in other words, about the accumulation of the indicative sentences.
	
	
	The primary judge quoted extensively from the psychologist’s report and then commented –
	


“[The applicant] … has a reasonably length[y] criminal history, being first convicted in 2006 when he was 20 years of age. It is surprising in view of his formative years as a child and teenager that there do not appear to be any offences before then. His offences, however, since then have been violent and usually involve attempts to obtain money. As a result of convictions for these matters he has been incarcerated for much of his adult life.” [Emphasis added.]”


	
	It is clear that his Honour had referred to the applicant’s criminal history. His convictions after the first two did not involve attempts to get money. I would read the phrase “since then” as referring to the time he commenced to offend and thus to the first two offences on his record, which involved extensive periods of incarceration. Whether the applicant’s history showed that he had been incarcerated for much of his adult life (which was what the psychologist reported the applicant as saying), is perhaps doubtful, but rather depends on what his Honour meant by “much”. His Honour had earlier referred to the applicant’s time as an adult as having involved “a substantial period of time in custody”. To my mind, these imprecise terms are accurate enough and certainly do not bespeak error. Be that as it may, the primary judge accepted the psychologist’s opinion that the applicant had “developed an institutionalisation that it is more convenient and easy for him to adopt and adhere to rules in an institutionalised settings rather than living within the community”. His Honour said that he was not convinced that the applicant had demonstrated any remorse; there was an underlying suspicion that the offences were committed to ensure he was re-incarcerated. He accepted the evaluation of the psychologist that the applicant’s prospects of not reoffending were not good.
	
	
	His Honour concluded the discussion of the relevant objective, subjective and statutory considerations with the following –
	


“The offences of such a significant violent nature that it is appropriate that the sentence pay particular attention to the protection of the community and I propose to sentence him with that in mind. Counsel for the offender has requested that I find special circumstances. I will vary slightly the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period to take into account the concepts of totality and proportionality in the overall sentencing of the offender.”

The ratio between the indicative non-parole and parole periods for the first offence was the default ratio in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act but that in respect of the second was varied slightly, in that the indicative non-parole period was 4 years 9 months as distinct from the 4 years 10 ½ months which the default ratio would have yielded. The aggregate sentence was 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years 4 months. (The default ratio would have produced a non-parole period of 8 years 3 months. I do not doubt that his Honour had intended to apply the default ratio and the result was an error of calculation.)

Discussion


	
	It is convenient to deal with the grounds of appeal together, as they are interrelated.
	
	
	So far as the non-parole periods and the primary judge’s finding of special circumstances are concerned (aside from the calculation error), his Honour’s reasoning is reasonably clear and, indeed, justified. First, as to the ultimate non-parole period, it is apparent that the primary judge did not intend to impose a longer non-parole period than would have resulted from application of what might be called the default ratio in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act: his Honour made no reference to the need to vary the ratio to increase the proportion of the sentence to be served in prison and a mere additional month – which his Honour’s (miscounted) calculation produced – would have amounted to mere tinkering which, I am satisfied, was not his Honour’s intention. So far as the adjustment to which his Honour referred in the above quoted passage is concerned, this was, as I read his Honour’s remarks, designed to ensure that the aggregate sentence, despite accumulation of the indicative sentences, would nevertheless reflect the default ratio. The reference to “totality and proportionality” make it clear that his Honour had concluded that there was no basis, for example relating to rehabilitation or other personal considerations, for reducing the ultimate non-parole period which the default ratio would produce. It follows that the aggregate sentence reflected his Honour’s conclusion as to the appropriate outcome and I am unpersuaded that it was inconsistent with his Honour’s finding of special circumstances. It seems to me, however, that the calculation of the non-parole period imposed should be corrected, although this would result in a reduction of only a month.
	
	
	Although this is not the subject of a distinct ground of appeal, it is submitted on the applicant’s behalf additionally to the contention in the ground of appeal that the primary judge gave no or inadequate significance to his finding of institutionalisation in relation to the issue of special circumstances and erred in his conclusions about the effect of the psychological evidence tendered on behalf of the applicant. However, in addition to specifically accepting that the applicant “has developed an institutionalisation that [makes] it more convenient and easy for him to adopt and adhere to rules in institutionalised settings” and then setting out the substance of the psychologist’s assessment of this problem, noting “his desire to remain in custody raises concerns about his risk of reoffending”, his Honour went on also to note the possibility that he suffers from a post traumatic response, the results of the psychometric testing, problems with behavioural regulation and lack of skills for coping in the community. It is apparent that the primary judge accepted that all these matters were relevant to the applicant’s conduct in the sense of his ability to avoid offending and the prospects for effective rehabilitation. He expected that some of these issues would be addressed in prison and by services available to him on release. Of particular importance was the applicant’s indication to the psychologist (accepted as truthful) that, in effect, “he feels safer in custody and the pressures of reality are significantly reduced”. His Honour concluded –
	


“[The] emphasis must be upon deterrence, specific and general, and the protection of the community in preference to his rehabilitation … [which] if it does take place will have to do so within the confines … of imprisonment.”


	
	In oral submissions, counsel for the applicant responded to the point that the applicant’s adult incarceration was considerably less than that indicated in the psychologist’s report (adopted by the primary judge) by submitting that his Honour therefore acted under a misapprehension of the applicant’s criminal history which led him to conclude that the applicant’s chances of rehabilitation were worse than his history indicated. This was the first occasion upon which such a submission was made; it was not mentioned below on the applicant’s behalf. Counsel pointed to the fact that the applicant had spent a significant period of his early childhood in a boys’ home and submitted that the conclusion of the psychologist that he was institutionalised – as in effect stated by the applicant himself in his history – was appropriate but that his Honour’s error about the extent of his adult incarceration meant that his scepticism about the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation was not justified or, at least, excessive.
	
	
	Quite apart from the fact that the psychologist’s report was tendered on the applicant’s behalf without any mention of the error and on the basis that it should be accepted, I am of the opinion that a fair consideration of his Honour’s reasons reveals, with respect, that his Honour considered the whole of the applicant’s psychological situation as explored in the report and did not act simply on the basis that the extent of the applicant’s incarceration significantly reduced his chances of rehabilitation. His Honour’s observation that the applicant’s lack of remorse and his apparent eagerness to be incarcerated, including having no “significant concern” about his incarceration on the current offence was entirely justified. Though some part of the opinion of the psychologist as to the extent of applicant’s institutionalisation was based on a mistaken understanding of his criminal history, his Honour does not appear to have made the same error and was entitled to act on the basis that it was appropriate to place weight on the psychologist’s conclusion, which was founded on other highly significant material. I think his Honour’s discussion of this matter indicates that he was far more concerned with what the applicant himself had said about his feelings, attitudes and conduct. Furthermore, in considering the significance of this matter, there was no basis for inferring that it showed the applicant was actually able to cope in the community, since there was no evidence as to what he did when he was at large except for the time (perhaps a year) when he was able to be assisted by his partner. The fact that he had become involved in the offences for which he was being sentenced was eloquent evidence of his inability to avoid serious criminality.
	
	
	It cannot be right to criticise here the judge’s failure to take the period when the applicant was free explicitly into account, when the applicant put no material at all before the court about it except that he found it difficult to avoid re-incarceration in the absence of his partner’s support. That it appears the applicant was not charged with any offences during this period does not, without more information about what he was actually doing, show much about his rehabilitation, particularly in light of his statements that he committed offences in order to be incarcerated – though the example he gave to the psychologist of riding a bicycle whilst intoxicated excites scepticism that this is what he actually had in mind. However, this matter was not relied on below, perhaps for good reason, and it is not for this Court to consider it now.
	
	
	Counsel in this Court relied on the primary judge’s conclusion as to the applicant’s institutionalisation in his submissions about special circumstances. Counsel submitted that the risk of institutionalisation, even if in the face of entrenched and serious recidivism, may justify a finding of special circumstances, citing Jackson v R [2010] NSWCCA 162 and Jinnette v R [2012] NSWCCA 217. In Jinnette Johnson J (Hoeben JA (as his Honour then was) and Beech-Jones J agreeing), observed (at [98]) that the risk of institutionalisation is a factor capable of constituting “special circumstances” but this did not require such a finding. As here, Jinnette was very likely already institutionalised when he came to be sentenced and would almost certainly be so when his sentence had been served. Johnson J pointed out (at [103]) that the relevance of this factor might give rise to a need for an increased period of conditional and supervised liberty “to assist the protection of the community, by maximising the prospect that the Applicant will not reoffend”. His Honour went on to say –
	


“[104] It is the case that the Applicant has had a terrible life involving a dysfunctional family and constant negative events involving abuse and exploitation of him by others. There is no way that his life can be recalled and a more positive life substituted for it. All reasonable persons will have a considerable measure of sympathy for him.

[105] At the same time, reasonable members of the community will observe what the Applicant has done consistently when at large in the community, offending in different ways including placing members of the community at risk and harming them. There is a history of failed conditional liberty and breaches of parole. The criminal justice system has no ready solution for cases such as this given the relatively blunt instruments available to it.

[106] The protection of the community remains a most important consideration in a case such as this, involving incapacitation through incarceration of the Applicant, and also the protection of the community in taking reasonable steps to provide an opportunity for intensive supervision when the Applicant comes to be considered for release on parole.”


	
	The applicant has also a history of breaching bonds and I would accept that the same considerations to which Johnson J referred are applicable in this case. However, it is obvious that the principles to which his Honour referred may have different outcomes in different cases and his Honour was far from suggesting that institutionalisation must in every case amount to special circumstances requiring a longer parole period than otherwise would result by applying the default ratio, so that the failure to do so amounts to appealable error. The primary judge discussed at some length the rehabilitative needs of the applicant, including supervision of various kinds upon release. Furthermore, the additional problem in the present case was the applicant’s attitude towards incarceration. I am not persuaded that his Honour overlooked the significance of institutionalisation in the applicant’s case for the purpose of considering special circumstances.
	


Conclusion


	
	I would reject all three grounds of appeal. I propose the following orders –
	



	
	Leave to appeal against sentence granted.
	
	
	Appeal allowed in part by varying the non-parole period from 8 years 4 months to 8 years 3 months, commencing on 26 June 2013 and expiring on 25 September 2021. The earliest date upon which the offender is eligible for release is 25 September 2021.
	
	
	Otherwise appeal dismissed.
	



	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Adams J.

		11 December 2015",2015-12-10 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2768442,B v R [2015] NSWCCA 314,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Applicant, B, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on 5 December 2014 for an offence of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) contrary to s.25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. A pseudonym is used in this judgment to describe the Applicant because of evidence before the Court concerning his assistance to authorities.
	
	
	After a plea of guilty, the Applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Berman SC at the Sydney District Court to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years commencing on 26 September 2014 and expiring on 25 September 2016, with a balance of term of 18 months commencing on 26 September 2016 and expiring on 25 March 2018.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	


Ground of Appeal


	
	The Applicant relies upon a single ground of appeal which asserts that the sentence imposed was, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.
	


Facts of Offence


	
	It is not necessary to set out in fine detail the facts of the offence for the purpose of determining this application. The events which comprised the offence occurred in July-August 2013, when the Applicant was 41 years old. The sentencing Judge described the offence in the following way (ROS1-2):
	


“There was a significant police operation in progress over the last few years. An undercover officer was involved. The undercover officer made arrangements to purchase drugs. A kilogram of methylamphetamine was what he was after and the person to whom he was speaking indicated that he could supply them. Unfortunately for that person, and probably unfortunately for the offender, that person's usual supplier of drugs was unable to come up with what was required and so the offender was approached.

Through his involvement with others, who themselves are involved in organised crime, he was able to introduce the man who had promised to supply the undercover officer to those involved in organised crime who could supply a kilogram of methylamphetamine.

The offender's role was as an essential conduit between purchaser and supplier. It was not simply a case, however, of making the introduction and leaving. The offender engaged, over a number of days, in communications, ensuring that the supply would actually take place, as it eventually did.

On that occasion the offender was the person who carried the drugs into the premises where the transaction was to take place. He was given a relatively small sum of money after the transaction occurred and then he transported the bulk of the cash out of the premises returning it to another location where it was counted.”


	
	The sentencing Judge expanded upon the Applicant’s role and his motivation (ROS2-3):
	


“I should mention that the offender's role extended beyond what I have outlined by reason of the circumstance that the first people he approached to supply the drugs could not do so. Rather than giving in, he approached others who, as it turns out, did supply the drugs the subject of this charge. The offender's conduct was seriously criminal. 

The offender's motivation was relatively simple. He was not a drug user. He said that his desire was to help out a man who he thought was a friend. He realised he would probably get some money, but I rather gather that his motivation was simply to do something to assist the person he thought was a friend. Of course, once he was involved in the transaction, it was very difficult to back out. He saw a firearm at one stage and explains his involvement in the actual transaction, taking the drugs in and the money out, by saying that he felt pressured to do more than just put people in touch with one another, by the reputations and conduct of those involved.

This was, of course, very serious conduct by the offender. It is fortunate that ultimately the drugs were purchased by an undercover police officer so they were not distributed to drug users which would have only added to the misery that drug supply causes.""


	
	The quantity of methylamphetamine involved was 999.6 grams (with a purity of 59%), four times the commercial quantity and a small amount short of the large commercial quantity of one kilogram as prescribed at the date of the offence. (From 1 September 2015, the threshold for a large commercial quantity has been reduced to 500 grams). The purchase price for the drugs was $235,000.00. The Applicant received $2,700.00 for his role in the drug supply.
	


Some Other Findings by the Sentencing Judge


	
	The sentencing Judge noted that the Applicant has a criminal history for fraud and driving offences but had no drug offences on his history. This was the Applicant’s first full-time custodial sentence.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge stated that the Applicant had assisted the authorities “to a remarkable degree”. The assistance had been both past and promised future assistance. The sentencing Judge outlined aspects of that assistance, which supported the finding of assistance “to a remarkable degree”. That finding is not challenged in this Court. It is the case that there have been significant consequences for the Applicant as a result of this assistance.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge allowed the Applicant a combined discount on sentence of 60% for his early plea of guilty and his assistance to the authorities, both past and promised for the future. His Honour indicated that 15% of that discount was for promised future assistance.
	
	
	His Honour had regard to the Applicant’s family circumstances and work history.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge was satisfied that the Applicant’s expression of remorse was genuine. Regard was had, as well, to a psychological report which stated that the Applicant suffered from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.
	
	
	His Honour observed that, given the gravity of the offence, a significant component of general deterrence was required despite the Applicant’s psychological matters.
	


The Ground of Appeal - A Claim of Manifest Excess

Submissions


	
	Mr Edwards, counsel for the Applicant, submitted that a notional starting point of imprisonment for eight years and nine months, with a non-parole period of five years, supported the claim of manifest excess in this case.
	
	
	He submitted that the Applicant had acted as a conduit, and that his principal motive was to assist persons he knew, rather than monetary gain alone. Counsel pointed to a number of other sentencing decisions which he submitted supported the Applicant, including R v Shi [2004] NSWCCA 135; Blair v R [2005] NSWCCA 78; 152 A Crim R 462; Hockey v R [2006] NSWCCA 146 and R v Anderson [2012] NSWCCA 175.
	
	
	Mr Edwards sought to rely, as well, upon sentencing statistics which, he submitted, supported the claim of manifest excess in this case (by reference to a notional starting point).
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the focus on a sentence appeal must be the sentence actually imposed rather than a notional starting point: Mun v R [2015] NSWCCA 234 at [54]-[55].
	
	
	It was submitted for the Crown that the sentencing Judge had characterised properly the Applicant’s role as being essential, with a substantial quantity of methylamphetamine being involved.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to a number of sentencing decisions which, it was submitted, indicated that the sentence imposed upon the Applicant was not manifestly excessive: R v Dang [2005] NSWCCA 430; R v Shi; Do v R [2008] NSWCCA 34; R v Mendez [2005] NSWCCA 246; 155 A Crim R 241; Blair v R.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that manifest excess has not been demonstrated by the Applicant.
	


Decision


	
	To succeed on his single ground of appeal, the Applicant must demonstrate that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust. A claim of manifest excess is not justified simply because, if it be the case, the result arrived at at first instance is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538-539 [58]-[59].
	
	
	Caution must be exercised when a claim of error on sentence is sought to be supported by reference to a notional starting point rather than the sentence actually imposed: SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 at 257 [40]; Mun v R at [54].
	
	
	That said, I am not persuaded, in any event, that examination of the notional starting point discloses error in this case. This was a serious offence of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. The quantity involved fell just short of the large commercial quantity, for which the maximum penalty is life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 15 years.
	
	
	The Applicant played a significant role in the offence over a number of days. This role involved establishing contacts between people and having physical responsibility, at one stage, for the substantial quantity of drugs involved together with the large sum of cash which was the purchase price.
	
	
	The standard non-parole period of 10 years was a guidepost on sentence.
	
	
	The Applicant received a combined discount of 60% for his plea and his assistance to authorities. It is necessary to keep in mind, as well, that the sentencing Judge was obliged to comply with s.23(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which required that a lesser penalty imposed because of assistance to authorities “must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence”.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge considered all relevant aspects of the case. The Applicant’s subjective case was taken into account. The psychologist’s report did not suggest any causal link between any condition and the offending conduct. General deterrence still had a role to play on sentence as well. After making the substantial (and appropriate) allowance for the Applicant’s assistance to authorities, the Court imposed a sentence which reflected the objective seriousness of his offence.
	
	
	The non-parole period was 57% of the head sentence, reflecting a finding of special circumstances in the Applicant’s favour.
	
	
	Sentencing statistics provide no real assistance on sentence in this case: Thompson-Davis v R [2013] NSWCCA 75 at [53].
	
	
	I accept the Crown submission that a comparison with sentences imposed in broadly similar cases such as R v Dang; R v Shi; Do v R; R v Mendez and Blair v R serve to demonstrate that the sentence imposed upon the Applicant was not manifestly excessive. Brief mention is made below to these decisions.
	
	
	In R v Dang, a 24-year old offender was sentenced for supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine (983 grams) of 82.5% purity. The offender was more than a mere courier and was in contact with the supplier and the buyer. This Court (on a Crown appeal) imposed a sentence (after a 25% discount for a guilty plea) of imprisonment for nine years with a non-parole period of five years.
	
	
	In R v Shi, a 19-year old offender was sentenced for supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (992.2 grams) of 84.5% purity. The offender had played a delivery role. This Court (on a Crown appeal) imposed a sentence (after a 25% discount for a guilty plea) of imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of three years.
	
	
	In Do v R, a 46-year old offender was sentenced for supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (497.4 grams) of 74% purity. The offender was more than a mere courier and provided bags of drugs to a co-offender who supplied an undercover officer. This Court (on Do’s appeal) imposed a sentence (after a 20% discount for a guilty plea) of imprisonment for six years and six months with a non-parole period of three years and six months.
	
	
	In R v Mendez, a 22-year old offender was sentenced for supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (478.8 grams) of 84% purity. He was not a mere courier and was involved in a number of aspects of the drug supply business. He was convicted after trial. This Court (on a Crown appeal) imposed a sentence of imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of five years and six months.
	
	
	In Blair v R, the offender was sentenced for supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (371.3 grams) of 6-14.5% purity. He was a courier and storeman who collected and retained drugs. He was convicted after trial. This Court (on Blair’s appeal) imposed a sentence of imprisonment for seven years with a non-parole period of five years and three months.
	
	
	The Applicant has not demonstrated that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	BUTTON J: I agree with Johnson J.
	
	
	FAGAN J: I agree with Johnson J.

		11 December 2015",2015-12-10 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2768443,R v Zolfonoon [2015] NSWDC 296,"Remarks on sentence


	
	On 17 July 2014, the offender, Mr Kamran Zolfonoon, pleaded guilty and was committed for sentence in this court on two counts of supplying prohibited drugs in a large commercial quantity. The first count concerned the supply of slightly in excess of 3½ kilograms of heroin and the second count concerned the supply of just over 9 kilograms of methylamphetamine. The offender maintained his pleas in this court and appears today for sentence, following a sentence hearing which commenced on 5 June 2015 and was then adjourned for further hearing on 30 October 2015.
	
	
	The offender asks that when I sentence him in relation to the second of those two counts that I take into account 3 additional offences of possession of prohibited drugs, which are contained on a Form 1. The offender has acknowledged his guilt to the matters on the Form 1 and I consider it appropriate to take them into account, and will do so, when sentencing him in relation to the relevant count.
	
	
	In November 2011, NSW Police commenced investigations in relation to the supply of prohibited drugs by a number of people including the offender. That investigation was conducted under the name Strike Force Taipan. The Police had 2 registered informers (one male and female) who agreed to provide information and assistance in those investigations. Those informers acted at the direction and upon the instruction of Police.
	
	
	The male informer arranged to meet the offender on 16 November 2011 and on that day he introduced the female informer to the offender. The male informer told the offender that he and the female informer had been with lawyers all day and that they were under financial pressure on account of exorbitant legal fees. The male informer sought the assistance of the offender to source drugs for the female informer so that she could alleviate her financial difficulties through drug dealing. In the ensuing period, to February 2012, the female informer had numerous contacts with the offender, both by phone and in person. The offender made it clear to the female informer that he did not have the financial capacity to purchase the drugs sought by the female informer and that he did not have much control over the amounts of particular drugs that he could access for the female informer.
	
	
	On 24 November 2011, the female informer introduced the offender to an undercover police officer (UCO). During this meeting the offender and the UCO discussed the offender’s capacity to supply prohibited drugs. The offender indicated that he had access to large quantities of prohibited drugs including heroin and methylamphetamine. The UCO requested that the offender obtain samples of these drugs so she could assess their quality prior to purchasing larger quantities. Immediately after this meeting the offender contacted a co­offender Hendawi and asked if they could meet and if Hendawi could provide drug samples. Hendawi was unable to comply. The offender met with the UCO and the female informer on 4 occasions over the following weeks and explained delays that were hindering his ability to supply the samples as arranged. Notwithstanding representations about his capacity to access prohibited drugs, including in large quantities, the offender evidently had considerable trouble obtaining access even to samples to provide the UCO.
	
	
	On 4 January 2012 the female informer met the offender in person. During this meeting the offender and the female informer discussed the price of drugs and the offender stated that there was 3.5 kg heroin available that he could put on hold, but he was unsure of its quality. The female informer urged the offender to try and source suppliers that could provide drugs on an ongoing basis. The offender indicated that he could not guarantee that he could fulfil that request.
	
	
	On 6 January 2012 the UCO and the female source met with the offender and the offender supplied the UCO 28.35 grams of methylamphetamine (with a purity of 80%), at a cost of $8,500 and 19.83 grams of heroin (with a purity of 47.5%), at a cost of $5,000, a total cost of $13,500.00. This supply took place in a car park underneath the offender’s place of work. The offender told the UCO that he could supply kilogram quantities of methylamphetamine for $220,000 and of heroin for $150,000.
	
	
	Surveillance disclosed that the offender’s source for the drugs supplied at this meeting was Hendawi and the offender paid Hendawi for the drugs after the supply had taken place.
	
	
	On 10 January 2012 the female informer placed an order with the offender for one kilogram of heroin, to be purchased by the UCO. Following this conversation the offender met with Hendawi. During that meeting the offender contacted the UCO and indicated that the heroin could be supplied on 17 January.
	
	
	On 17 January, Hendawi met with another co-accused, Dashti, from whom he obtained a kilogram of heroin. Hendawi then met with the offender and passed the heroin to him. The offender then met with the UCO at a café across the road from the martial arts training facility which he ran at Rozelle, the Wu Shu Academy. The offender and the UCO then went across to the Academy, where the offender supplied the UCO with what was purportedly 1 kilogram of heroin in exchange for $150,000 in controlled monies. Subsequent analysis revealed that the heroin supplied weighed 993 grams (with a purity of 46%).
	
	
	The offender subsequently met with Hendawi who, in turn, subsequently met with Dashti, all presumably to pass the proceeds of the supply back up the line.
	
	
	On 1 February 2012 the female informer met the offender and placed an order for a further half kilogram of heroin to be purchased on 6 or 8 February 2012. The offender indicated a desire to supply two and a half kilograms. The female informer indicated that the UCO needed to purchase the half kilogram prior to purchasing the further two kilograms.
	
	
	Following this meeting the offender placed an order with Hendawi for half a kilogram of heroin.
	
	
	Hendawi then placed an order with Dashti for that quantity of heroin to be supplied on 6 February, with the possibility of a further two kilograms being supplied on 9 February.
	
	
	On 6 February, Hendawi obtained the half kilogram of heroin from Dashti and then on-supplied it to the offender at the Wu Shu Academy. The offender then met with the UCO and exchanged the heroin, later analysed to weigh 496 g (with a purity of 31%), for $75,000.
	
	
	On 8 February 2012 the female informer contacted the offender and placed an order for the remaining 2 kilograms of heroin. The offender then placed the order with Hendawi, who himself subsequently placed an order with Dashti. On 9 February 2012, the offender made arrangements with Hendawi and the UCO in anticipation of the supply later that day. That supply was eventually frustrated by the intervention of police, who arrested Dashti at a storage facility in Artarmon where he stored prohibited drugs. Hendawi’s numerous attempts to contact Dashti that day to arrange the supply of the heroin for on-supply to the offender were fruitless as Dashti was in police custody.
	
	
	On 24 June 2012 the UCO met with the offender. This meeting was scheduled after the offender had indicated to the female informer, during two meetings she had with him in May 2012, that he currently had access to multiple kilograms of methylamphetamine. At this meeting the offender supplied the UCO with small amount of white crystal substance, as a sample of the available methylamphetamine, and discussed supplying large quantities of the drug. He told the female informer he was leaving to go overseas with family but would be able to return if needed to participate in the supply of drugs. Subsequent analysis indicated that there was 0.48 grams of methylamphetamine (with a purity of 76%) in the sample supplied by the offender to the UCO.
	
	
	On 25 June 2012 the offender left the country for an extended period of time, returning to Australia on 2 September 2012.
	
	
	Between September 2012 and May 2013 there were 9 meetings between the male informer and the offender.
	
	
	On 24 May 2013, the male informer met with the offender at Rozelle. The male informer was provided with a sample of heroin by the offender who stated that he currently had access to between 4 and 10 kilograms of the drug. The male informer indicated that he would make enquiries about the heroin and let the offender know. Subsequent analysis indicated that the sample provided to the male informer by the offender was 0.44 grams of heroin (with a purity of 28.5%).
	
	
	On 30 May 2013, the male informer again met with the offender in Rozelle. The male informer was provided with a sample of methylamphetamine by the offender who stated he had access to 10 - 15 kilograms of that drug and a quantity of heroin. The offender stated that these drugs were being provided by an associate in Bexley and that the price of the methylamphetamine was $215,000 per kilogram. Subsequent analysis indicated that the sample provided to the male informer by the offender was 0.23 grams of methylamphetamine (with a purity of 74%).
	
	
	As a result of lawfully intercepted conversations and the two samples supplied to the male informer investigators apprehended that the offender had access to suppliers who could obtain large amounts of prohibited drugs, including heroin and methylamphetamine. Consequently further investigations were commenced into the offender’s activities in an attempt to identify other individuals involved in the supply of prohibited drugs. As a result, investigators identified a co-offender Haissan Saleh (Saleh) as a current up line supplier to the offender.
	
	
	On July 10 2013, the male and female informer introduced a further undercover police officer (whom I will refer to as UCO 2) to the offender as someone wishing to purchase methylamphetamine. During this meeting the offender indicated that the price of a kilogram of methylamphetamine had increased to $235,000. During this meeting UCO 2 indicated a desire to purchase a kilogram 'sample' of methylamphetamine prior to purchasing multiple kilograms on an ongoing basis. The offender stated that this would not be a problem. Tentative arrangements were made for the offender to supply UCO 2 with the kilogram 'sample' on Friday 19 July 2013.
	
	
	On 17 July 2013 the female informer met with the offender and they spoke about the possibility of again obtaining heroin for the UCO who had been involved in the heroin supplies in 2012.
	
	
	The proposed supply of methylamphetamine to UCO 2, originally arranged for 19 July was postponed to 22 July, apparently on account of Saleh being unable to obtain the kilogram sample in sufficient time.
	
	
	Between 19 July and 22 July 2013 the offender made repeated attempts to source the methylamphetamine sought by UCO 2. He had a number of intercepted conversations concerning a meeting with Saleh on 22 July 2013. It became apparent on 22 July that Saleh had again been unable to source the kilogram of methylamphetamine for the offender to provide to UCO 2. During this same period Saleh was having coded conversations with another co-accused, whom I will simply refer to as AB, enquiring how AB was progressing in obtaining an unidentified item. It became apparent in the afternoon of 22 July that AB was unable to source a promised kilogram of methylamphetamine, indicating it would be at least another day.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 22 July 2013, in a telephone call with the offender, Saleh indicated that he needed to see the offender in person to show him something. About 3:30pm police observed Saleh and the offender meet on the Pacific Highway, at Artarmon. After approximately 15 minutes of conversation, Saleh and the offender approached Saleh's vehicle where another co-accused, Hijazi, was seated. Hijazi then joined the conversation with the other two.
	
	
	At about 4:46pm UCO 2 met with the offender at the Wu Shu Academy. The offender told UCO 2 that he had been unable to source the kilogram of methylamphetamine earlier promised. Whilst still in the presence of UCO 2, the offender contacted Saleh by phone. After this call, the offender requested more time and told UCO 2 he was attempting to source the drugs from someone else who he simply identified as a female friend of a friend.
	
	
	At 4:42 pm another co-accused, Negash, met with Saleh and Hijazi. Negash is the female friend the offender had referred to following his conversation with Saleh. At about 5:05pm Saleh and Hijazi left the meeting in Saleh’s vehicle, with Negash following them in her vehicle.
	
	
	At 5:05pm Saleh contacted the offender and indicated that he was 10 to 15 minutes away. About 5:38pm Saleh, Hijazi and Negash arrived at Rozelle. Saleh was seen obtaining parking tickets from a nearby meter before speaking with Negash. A short time later Saleh entered the Wu Shu Academy. At 5:52pm the offender contacted UCO 2 and asked him to come to the Wu Shu Academy.
	
	
	At 6:05pm UCO 2 met with the offender at the Wu Shu Academy. The offender handed UCO 2 a parking ticket that contained a small amount of white crystal substance. This parking ticket was from the location where Saleh had been seen obtaining a parking ticket on his arrival at Rozelle. The offender indicated to UCO 2 that this was a sample of methylamphetamine and an associate had 100 grams nearby to purchase if UCO 2 was interested. UCO 2 indicated that he was interested. The offender then contacted Saleh by phone and told Saleh to “tell her it's okay” and to “just bring it”.
	
	
	About 6:09pm on 22 July, Saleh and Hijazi got out of Saleh’s vehicle. Hijazi walked to a nearby Thai restaurant where Negash was waiting with a small child, believed to be her daughter. Hijazi then went to Negash’s vehicle and using a key opened the front passenger door. Saleh leant into the vehicle before turning and walking away with a small dark package in his hand. Saleh walked to the Wu Shu Academy where he met with the offender and UCO 2. Saleh handed UCO 2 a black sock containing methylamphetamine. An agreement was reached for UCO 2 to pay $21,000 for these drugs, which were subsequently analysed to be 97.1 grams of methylamphetamine (with a purity of 85.5%). The drugs earlier supplied in the parking ticket weighed 0.21 grams, making a total supply that day of 97.31 grams of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	On 29 July 2013 the female informer met with the offender to enquire whether heroin supplied to the male informer on 24 May 2013, and said to be available for $60,000 a kilogram, was still available. The offender indicated that the $60,000 per kilogram heroin was no longer available, however he had a new up line supplier with kilograms available for between $210,000 and $220,000 per kilogram. The offender supplied the female informer with a small piece of paper containing a sample, which was analysed to contain 0.4 grams of heroin (with 4.5% purity).
	
	
	Also on 29 July 2013, UCO 2 and the offender had a telephone conversation in which the offender enquired when UCO 2 would be available to purchase the one kilogram of methylamphetamine previously sought by him. UCO 2 informed the offender that it would most likely be on Monday 5 or Tuesday 6 August 2013.
	
	
	Intercepted communications revealed subsequent arrangements between the offender and Saleh, and then between Saleh and AB, concerning the possibility of supply of a kilogram of methylamphetamine on 5 or 6 August.
	
	
	The offender met with Saleh, AB and a man named Kocak on the afternoon of 4 August 2013 at Rozelle. Kocak is described in the statement of facts as a fully patched member of the Eastlakes Chapter of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club. Later that day, the offender and Saleh spoke on the telephone and discussed how the others were after the meeting. The offender queried specifically how ""the guy"" was and whether he was happy. Saleh indicated that both men appeared happy with what was discussed at the meeting.
	
	
	At about noon on 6 August 2013, AB and Kocak met at an address in Greenacre. About half an hour later Saleh, who was in the company of the offender, had a phone conversation with AB in Arabic, in which Saleh informed AB that “it had worked out” and to wait for Saleh to call him.
	
	
	A few minutes later, AB and Kocak left the Greenacre address with another man named Restom, but police surveillance lost sight of the vehicle after a short period of time.
	
	
	Shortly before 1pm, UCO 2 met with the offender at Mascot, in accordance with an earlier arrangement. Saleh was also at that location, but remained in his vehicle whilst the offender spoke with UCO 2. The offender told UCO 2 that they had to travel to Greenacre to obtain the kilogram of methylamphetamine. The offender instructed UCO 2 to follow Saleh’s car, which was the vehicle in which the offender would be travelling. In the course of the journey to Greenacre, Saleh, in the presence of the offender, phoned AB twice and told him that they were on their way and to get ready. He called a third time, at about 1:14 pm to tell AB that they were about a minute away. Very soon after that call Saleh and the offender arrived at the Greenacre address with UCO 2 following behind them. Saleh left his vehicle and went into the house. The offender got out of Saleh’s car and spoke to UCO 2. UCO 2 told the offender that he was not prepared to go inside the premises and asked the offender to bring the kilogram of methylamphetamine to his car for the exchange to take place. The offender went into the house and emerged again a short time later carrying a purple bag which contained the drugs and which UCO 2 exchanged for $235,000 in controlled monies. Subsequent analysis indicated that what UCO2 purchased was 999.6 grams of methylamphetamine (with a purity of 59%).
	
	
	After a short discussion with UCO2 regarding prices for future multi-kilogram purchases of methylamphetamine, the offender went back into the house carrying the pre recorded 'buy' money in a large brown paper bag and UCO 2 drove away.
	
	
	The whole transaction had been overseen by Kocak who had been sitting in a car nearby. Three minutes after the offender entered the Greenacre house with the money, AB left the house carrying a bag identical in appearance to the brown paper bag supplied by UCO 2 to the offender that contained the controlled money. AB got into his car and drove to another address in a different part of Greenacre. He was followed back to that address by Kocak and both of them went inside the second house.
	
	
	Whilst the exchange was taking place in his car at Greenacre on 6 August, UCO 2 placed an order with the offender for multiple kilograms of methylamphetamine, specifically 8 - 10 kg. The offender attempted to organise that supply via AB by contacting Saleh. The offender and UCO 2 also subsequently had several phone conversations about this proposed drug supply.
	
	
	The offender thereafter met twice with AB, Saleh and Kocak. The first meeting was a few days after the 6 August supply. On that occasion Saleh and AB drove Kocak to meet with the offender in Rozelle. The second meeting was in the afternoon of 13 August 2013, also at Rozelle, in a coffee shop near the Wu Shu Academy. In the course of that meeting the offender and Kocak left the others and walked and talked for about 15 minutes before returning to the café to re-join Saleh and AB.
	
	
	At around 7 pm that night, the offender and UCO 2 spoke by phone about the potential for more drug supplies.
	
	
	On 18 August 2013, AB left the country. Thereafter the syndicate involving Kocak was no longer accessible to the offender, as he had no means of contacting Kocak directly.
	
	
	Surveillance revealed that the offender then began making enquiries elsewhere, including through Saleh, trying to locate an alternative source of multiple kilograms of methylamphetamine to sell to UCO 2.
	
	
	On 26 August 2013, the offender met with UCO 2 and another undercover officer, UCO 3. UCO 2 enquired about the progress of the multiple kilogram order of methylamphetamine he had placed with the offender. The offender indicated that he had located a source of 'ice' different from the source of the previous kilogram. At this meeting the offender supplied UCO 2 a small amount of 'ice' for UCO 2 to sample. Analysis indicated that this sample was 0.31 grams of methylamphetamine (with a purity of 79.5%).
	
	
	Around 9pm on 27 August 2013, the offender met with Saleh and another co-offender, Kassim Saleh, who is Saleh’s nephew, at the nephew’s house at Padstow. At that meeting the offender was introduced by Saleh to the co-offender Wilson. Enquiries by Saleh and his nephew, had identified Wilson as a prospective alternative source of multiple kilograms of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Following this meeting the offender spoke to both UCO 2 and to Saleh concerning the pending drug supply.
	
	
	Sometime on or about 28 August 2013, Wilson provided the offender with a Nokia mobile phone, similar to one possessed by Wilson. It is not known exactly when or how Wilson obtained the phones or provided one to the offender, but it must have been prior to the evening of 28 August 2013 when the first communication was made. The call charge records for the two phones show that the phone used by the offender was only used to make calls and send text messages to the other phone used by Wilson and was not used to communicate with any other phone. Wilson's phone was used only to contact the offender, with the exception of one call to a taxi driver who drove Wilson to a meeting with the offender on 29 August.
	
	
	On Thursday 29 August 2013, UCO 2 and the offender met at a warehouse at Kingsgrove to facilitate the supply of 8 kilograms of methylamphetamine to UCO 2 for an agreed price of $1.8 Million dollars.
	
	
	Wilson subsequently arrived at the warehouse by taxi and met with the offender and UCO 2. In the course of that meeting UCO 2 and Wilson counted the $1.8 million dollars. Once this had been done, Wilson left the warehouse in the taxi and returned in a white Ford he had left parked at Beverley Hills. When he returned to the warehouse at Kingsgrove, Wilson opened the boot of the Ford and removed an orange bucket, which contained the 8 kg of methylamphetamine. Wilson exchanged the drugs for the agreed price of $1.8 million dollars, from which the offender removed $240,000, being his cut from the transaction. Wilson walked out of the warehouse, placed a bag containing the remaining $1.56 million on the back seat of the Ford he had arrived in and attempted to drive away. He was stopped by police and arrested. The offender attempted to hide in the warehouse but was eventually arrested. In the course of his arrest he sustained several bites from a police dog.
	
	
	Analysis revealed that the orange bucket supplied by Wilson contained 7.977 kilograms of methylamphetamine (with a purity of 68%).
	
	
	Following the offender’s arrest, search warrants were executed at the Wu Shu Academy. Police gained access to a secured room that led to a small recess located in the roof. In this recess police found small amounts of heroin, opium and methylamphetamine (these substances are the subject of the three offences of possession on the Form 1). Police also found paraphernalia used to ingest drugs.
	
	
	There is no evidence of any specific large quantity supplies of prohibited drug by the offender to anyone other than undercover officers during the whole period of Strike Force Taipan. Police never located or seized any of the usual indicia of supply such as scales or ledgers and the like.
	
	
	The seriousness of the charged offences is self evident from the maximum penalty which Parliament has prescribed of life imprisonment and the applicable standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the present offending falls well above the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind, having regard to the frequency of offending and the weight and the purity of the drugs involved.
	
	
	Without any criticism intended, I should say immediately that whilst I consider the offending serious, I regard that submission as particularly ambitious when one considers the panoply of cases which come before this Court involving the offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of drugs. There are numerous matters that must be taken into account in assessing the objective gravity of offending of this kind. I accept that minds might reasonably differ on the weight that should be attributed to those matters, both individually and collectively. However, in my assessment, an appropriate balance of the various applicable considerations, which I will outline shortly, justifies a conclusion that the present offending falls below the mid-range of conduct that might be caught by the offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of drugs. There are considerations which realistically pull in opposite directions when considering the objective gravity of the offending.
	
	
	The offending occurred over an extended period of time, relevantly commencing on 6 January 2012 and ceasing upon arrest on 29 August 2013.
	
	
	The amounts involved in each case are not insignificant. In the case of the charge relating to heroin supply, 3.5 kgs (including the agreement to supply 2 kg never in fact supplied) and in the case of the charge concerning methylamphetamine, just over 9 kgs.
	
	
	The offending was constituted, in the case of the heroin charge, by 6 discrete transactions, although three of them were relatively small amounts, provided by way of sample. These samples were provided in pursuit either of the two larger principal transactions that were completed, or transactions in prospect that never occurred. One of the transactions comprised a proposed supply of 2kg, which was never consummated. The two larger supplies of heroin that actually took place involved the supply of just less than 1 kg on 17 January 2012 and just less than half a kilogram on 6 February 2012. The purity in each of those cases was only 46% and 31% respectively. Not high by any means, particularly for wholesale supply.
	
	
	In the case of all these supplies, the offender was one of several middlemen between the ultimate source of the drugs and the UCO purchasing from the offender. He was not part of an organised group. Rather, he appears to have been acting on his own account, employing connections he had, at least to the person immediately up line from himself in the chain of supply.
	
	
	In relation to the methyl amphetamine supply charge, there were 7 discrete transactions, 5 of which involved the provision of relatively small samples intended to facilitate larger supplies, which either occurred or were at the relevant time in prospect. The two principal supplies of methylamphetamine involved supply of just less than 1 kg on 6 August 2013 and slightly less than 8 kg on 29 August 2013. The purity of the drugs supplied in the two principal transactions was 59% and 68% respectively. Again, not remarkably high for a wholesale transaction. For example, they are in marked contrast to the purity of the tiny amount, 0.31 g, supplied on 26 August by way of purported sample for the final transaction, the purity of which was analysed to be 79.5%.
	
	
	In respect of all the methylamphetamine supplies, with the exception of the final, largest, transaction, the offender appears also to have been content to be one of several middlemen in the chain of supply. Again, he does not appear to have operated as part of an organised hierarchy, but rather to have employed his connections to identify sources of the drugs to be supplied to the UCOs. This attitude apparently changed following the 6 August supply. I will turn to consider this shortly.
	
	
	I agree with the Crown submission that the offender was a willing and enthusiastic participant in the transactions. I accept that one motivation was, at least in part, to assist the male and female informers in their expressed desire to try and raise funds on the ostensible basis that they needed money to pay lawyers for various criminal and family law matters in which they were, or were purportedly, embroiled. However, at least in respect of the two principal methylamphetamine supplies, the evidence points strongly to the primary motivation of the offender being personal financial gain.
	
	
	It is impossible to conclusively determine how much the offender benefitted from any of the supplies up to and including the 6 August 2013 methylamphetamine supply, however it is apparent that his financial reward in the final transaction was intended to be $240,000. This equates to $30,000 per kilogram and gives considerable force to the Crown submission that the offender’s reward for the 6 August supply was likely $30,000, having regard to the amounts purportedly received by others involved. Whether it was that amount, or less, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his reward for that transaction too was substantial and that it was financial reward more than anything that motivated him in respect of the final two large transactions. On his own account, as captured in the intercept material, the offender was suffering a degree of financial stress throughout the relevant period. This is corroborated by other evidence tendered on behalf of the offender on sentence. The evidence suggests that this financial stress was likely a consequence of a combination of limited success in his legitimate commercial endeavours and possibly maintaining a lifestyle beyond the capacity of his legitimate endeavours to support.
	
	
	The circumstances of the discrete supplies (by which I include also the agreement to supply the 2 kg of heroin) do not admit of a simplistic attribution to the offender of a particular role in the hierarchy of a broader criminal enterprise. The evidence suggests that he was, in each of the supplies, acting on his own account. However, not one of the supplies could have been ultimately affected without the intervention of others known to the offender who enjoyed immediate access to the ultimate source of the drugs; access that the offender did not himself have.
	
	
	The intercept material contains numerous instances of the offender representing that he has access to immediate sources of supply, including in large and consistent quantities. However the events which happened point very strongly to the probability that the offender was talking up the extent of his connections and involvement. Repeatedly throughout the chronology, from beginning to end, his confident assurances to the informers and the UCOs that he could obtain samples of drugs, or obtain supplies in large quantities, were frustrated by his own lack of immediate connection to ultimate sources of the drugs. This necessitated much scrambling around on his part, engaging others that he knew, like Hendawi and Saleh in particular, to try and identify sources of drugs that he could supply to the male or female informer or their undercover colleagues.
	
	
	It appears that the offender was a drug user himself. The nature and extent of that drug use is something I will consider separately in the context of the subjective case put by the offender. However, for present purposes I am satisfied that the offender was at least a user of drugs and, as a consequence, he had connections which he was able to call in aid in locating the ultimate sources of supply of drugs in the gradually escalating quantities sought by those involved in the controlled operations.
	
	
	Without those middlemen to call upon, it seems to me that the offender’s desire to fulfil the requests of the undercover operatives would in each of the discrete transactions have been entirely fruitless. The offender was not situated in a hierarchy of organised supply acting for or at the behest of the ultimate suppliers. It seems to me that the requests for supply by the male and female informers, and the UCOs that they introduced to the offender, provided the offender with an opportunity, which he willingly accepted, to benefit financially by insinuating himself into the chain of supply between them and the ultimate sources of supply to which his intermediary connections gave him indirect access.
	
	
	It appears that the offender’s desire to bring himself closer to the sources of ultimate supply escalated towards the end of the sequence of transactions that constitute the two offences. I am satisfied that after the first large methylamphetamine transaction the offender appears to have attempted to move closer to the ultimate source of supply. This seems a reasonable conclusion from the discussion the offender had with Kocak, to the exclusion of Saleh and AB, on 13 August 2013. In the end, however, AB’s departure overseas frustrated any opportunity for the offender to get closer to Kocak because without AB the offender had no means of contact with Kocak.
	
	
	Even for the purposes of locating a source for the final methylamphetamine transaction the offender was entirely dependent upon the resources or connections of Saleh to identify Wilson. Only once Wilson had been introduced to the offender did the two of them cut Saleh and his nephew out of the transaction, so bringing the offender into direct association with the ultimate source of that supply.
	
	
	This final transaction seems to me to represent a substantial escalation in objective criminality over the earlier transactions. Not only is the quantity of drugs increased by a significant amount, indeed it is the only single transaction which exceeds the threshold for a large commercial quantity, and it does so by a significant factor. The total financial reward to the offender is also increased by a significant amount in this transaction. In addition, positioning himself next in line to the ultimate source significantly elevates his role. This re-positioning was no doubt designed to secure a substantial increase in his own reward, and possibly also to decrease the risk of detection, by removing intermediate steps in the chain of supply.
	
	
	In all the earlier transactions, that is all the heroin transactions and the smaller methylamphetamine transactions leading up to and including the 6 August 2013 supply, it appears to me that the offender was prepared simply to be last in a chain of middlemen between the ultimate source and buyer and to take whatever cut of the proceeds was afforded him in that connection. As I have said it is impossible to ascertain quite what those returns might have been, with the possible exception of the 6 August transaction, if one can reasonably rely on the amounts it is asserted were made from the transaction by others associated with it.
	
	
	There is nothing which permits a conclusion that his reward for any of the earlier transactions approached the return which he appears likely to have derived from the 6 August transaction or that which he certainly would have derived from the 29 August transaction, but for the intervention of the police.
	
	
	Other aspects of the final transaction also suggest an escalation in the objective criminality. The last transaction involved a degree of sophistication and organisation that seems to have been much less a feature of the earlier transactions. This is evident in particular in the use of the mobile phones used by Wilson and the offender solely to communicate with one another in respect of the transaction. That is not to say that no attempt was made to employ techniques designed to minimise detection in relation to the earlier transactions, however the methods apparently adopted in those earlier transactions appear to have been far more ad hoc and to have depended much more on the dictates of those further up the chain of supply than the offender. Even in the final transaction, the greater organisation and sophistication seems primarily to have been achieved at the instigation of Wilson. It was him that provided the mobile phone to the offender and he was, as I found when sentencing him, associated with a well organised and sophisticated group.
	
	
	I do not accept the Crown submission that the objective gravity of the present offending far exceeded that of Wilson. In terms of the final transaction, which is the only one in which Wilson was relevantly involved, my assessment is that the objective criminality of the offender was less than that of Wilson’s. A number of matters seem to me to put the objective gravity of Wilson’s offending above that of the offender. First, is the fact of Wilson’s involvement in an apparently sophisticated organised criminal group. Second, the fact that it was Wilson who seemed primarily to dictate the manner of, and to make the arrangements for, the exchange. Third, the fact that Wilson engaged in other deliberate conduct to avoid detection, such as the use of separate vehicles for his initial attendance at the meeting and the subsequent delivery of the drugs. Fourth, the fact that the financial return to Wilson, or the group with which he was associated, appears, consistently with their up-line status, to have been considerably greater than the financial benefit to the offender.
	
	
	There is a degree of artificiality in attempting a comparison once other transactions are involved, however it seems to me that it is only if one takes into account the additional, smaller, supplies that make up the methylamphetamine supply charge in the present case, that one can sensibly say that the objective criminality in respect of that charge even approximates the criminality of Wilson in relation to the principal transaction involving the supply of nearly 8 kilograms.
	
	
	All that I have earlier outlined hopefully makes clear that there was frequently an incapacity on the part of the offender to make good his optimistic representations about the extent of his connections and his ability to supply. He was a willing participant, to be sure, but as was submitted on his behalf he was not the man, or even a man, relevantly in control of each of the transactions. He was in every case a petitioner to others who had greater control or better connections than him, and his petitioning was not always successful.
	
	
	The objective criminality in respect of the heroin supply charge, whilst undoubtedly serious, is in my assessment considerably less than the gravity of the methylamphetamine supply count.
	
	
	It seems to me that there must be borne in mind in the offender’s favour a number of matters which, at least to a limited extent, mitigate the objective gravity that is otherwise indicated by some of the considerations I have already outlined.
	
	
	First, the offending proceeded wholly in the course of operations initiated and directed by the authorities. This provides some limited explanation for the offending, particularly the offending up to and including 6 August 2013 at least, in that I have accepted that in addition to financial gain, the offender was in part motivated by a sense of loyalty or obligation to the male and female informer, or at least a desire to assist each of them in their respective asserted financial predicament.
	
	
	Second, consequential upon that first matter, none of the product supplied made its way into the community. Accordingly, the sort of danger and harm to which the offending might otherwise have given rise was necessarily excluded, albeit, as Senior Counsel for the offender put it, no thanks to the offender.
	
	
	Third, the offending was promoted and encouraged by the authorities well beyond the point when the police might have intervened and arrested the offender. The conduct in a sense occurs in two distinct periods. That in 2012 and that in 2013, sometime after the offender had returned to Australia from an overseas trip. The resumption of activity in 2013 seems to have been initiated by the employment of a similar tactic as was initially used, of importuning the offender to assist in helping the informer with financial difficulties. The police made an operational decision not to intervene in 2012. It seems that they did so primarily, but perhaps not solely, on account of the fact that the male informer was involved in other ongoing operations, unconnected with the offender, which presumably might have been compromised had intervention in this case occurred earlier in time.
	
	
	There was tendered on sentence, on the accused’s behalf, a report dated 8 October 2014 prepared by a psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen. There was also a supplementary report by the same doctor, dated 30 May 2015. There were also tendered numerous references, in excess of 15, including some from various family members, and a handwritten letter from the offender. There was also tendered a case note report from the Department of Corrective Services.
	
	
	It is from a combination of all that material that I have taken what follows concerning the offender’s subjective circumstances.
	
	
	The offender was born in Iran on 4 October 1968. He is currently 47 years of age. He was the third of four brothers born to his parents, and he also has an older half-brother and half-sister from a previous relationship of his mother. His father was an engineering contractor from a well known family who provided technical services to hospitals prior to the Iranian revolution.
	
	
	The offender had a happy early life in comfortable circumstances, and lived on the grounds of a large hospital in Tehran. The offender was told he walked and talked at the same time as his siblings and started school at the same time as everyone else, and reported that ""I was good in school ... we had a good life ... my father was famous ... but we lost everything with the revolution and the war with Iraq"". At the time of the revolution he was aged ten. The family left Iran at the time of the Iran-Iraq war in 1983, and came to Australia as his older half-brother had already settled here and had started a carpet business. The offender said that the family had to leave Iran in hurry and that his father was unable to work after arriving in Australia.
	
	
	After arriving in Australia, the offender attended an English language school, and then completed years eleven and twelve at Dover Heights High School, in the same years as his two older brothers. He completed high school without any learning or conduct problems. He commenced a degree in electrical engineering at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and did well in the first year. Around this time, he travelled regularly to China to study martial arts and traditional medicine, and was able to speak the Chinese dialect of the region in which he studied and was also able to read some Chinese characters.
	
	
	The offender has been with his partner, now his wife for twenty-five years. They married in 2000, after ten years together, and have one daughter, now aged eleven. His wife, who owns and runs a retail business with her mother, continues to support the offender notwithstanding his present circumstances.
	
	
	The material in the psychiatrist’s reports, save to the extent they record benign historical matters, carries limited weight in my view where the offender chose not to give evidence.
	
	
	Many of the referees have known the offender for years, some for much less time. The observations of all of them however, made in a variety of contexts, describe a man with exceptional qualities. He is widely regarded as mature, caring, loyal, creative, disciplined, highly skilled, hardworking and intelligent. He has deep roots in the Persian community in Sydney. He has devoted considerable time and effort to the needs of others, both within that community and more generally through his martial arts academy. Before his arrest he had owned and operated the Wu Shu Academy for many years in Rozelle. He is apparently among the highest ranking martial arts experts in Sydney, according to one referee. In addition to running the academy, the offender worked as a manager in his brother’s Persian Carpet business at Chatswood.
	
	
	To all the referees, these offences represent an uncharacteristic aberration on the part of the offender. To some of his referees the offender apparently explained his offending as having its genesis in financial problems arising from gambling. To other referees, particularly but not exclusively his family, the offender has sought to explain his offending by reference to an opium addiction. To the psychiatrist, the offender at first attributed the offending to trying to do the right thing by someone he had met (presumably the male informer), by introducing him to others. In an apparent attempt to distance himself from the offending, or to minimise his involvement, he is recorded by the psychiatrist as saying “I thought I would be introducing someone but it was organised in a way that I would be in the middle of it”. Later he also made reference to poor decision making attributable to the extent of his opium use.
	
	
	I accept that the offender used opium and other drugs, at least socially. I also have no difficulty accepting that it was as a consequence of that drug use that he made the various connections, like Saleh, that he employed in his efforts to locate sources of drugs to fill the orders placed by the male and female informants and the UCOs. Without some concrete independent support beyond the offender’s own out of court assertions, I do not accept that he was suffering from an opium addiction. A conclusion to that effect seems at odds with his wife’s observations of him. At odds with the description of someone who worked as much as the offender apparently did and who also was active to the extent of regularly playing golf. At odds with the fact that he needed no treatment once in custody and separated from any access to the drug.
	
	
	It will already be apparent that I accept that at least part of the offender’s motivation was a desire to help out the male and female informer. However, it seems to me that the conclusion is inescapable that a significant motivation was a desire for financial reward. This is consistent with the financial stress that the offender was subject to, which appears to have its genesis in a failed business venture with one of his brothers. Aside from some of the referees making reference to this financial stress, the offender’s wife gave evidence consistent with that conclusion and the offender himself, on some of the intercept material, makes reference to financial difficulties.
	
	
	The offender maintains in the letter to the Court that what he did was not done for greed. Maintenance of that view might be regarded as demonstrating a lack of candour, or at least a lack of insight, either of which might not augur especially well for prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	However, as humans, we tend to have a powerful capacity to rationalise our motives for particular conduct. Having regard to what I consider are substantial indicators in favour of the offender having excellent prospects of rehabilitation, and being unlikely in my instinctive assessment ever to engage again in offending of this character, I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt so far as his own assessment of what motivated him is concerned.
	
	
	There are numerous matters which it seems to me found a conclusion that the offender has excellent prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	First is the depth and strength of support he clearly continues to enjoy, notwithstanding the offending, in particular from his wife and immediate family, but also within the broader community, including among the Persian community and among people who he has trained or otherwise assisted through his martial arts academy. Relatedly, the offender is at an age and stage in his life, and his daughter is at an age and stage in her life, such that the desire to reconnect positively with his daughter will in my assessment be a powerful factor militating against the offender ever again re-offending. He has already deprived himself and his daughter of the experience of his substantial participation in significant years of her development. I apprehend he is well motivated to make appropriate amends for that deprivation.
	
	
	Second, he has a history of consistent employment and seems universally to be considered by his numerous referees as diligent and hardworking.
	
	
	Third, the corrective services records show that his conduct in prison has been exemplary. The relevant records are eloquent in their corroboration of much of what the referees observed concerning the positive personal qualities of the offender. It is not simply that the offender has been well behaved in custody, he has in fact made a positive contribution to the life of other prisoners and the conduct of the facilities in which he has been housed. Numerous corrective services case notes attest to the offender demonstrating an outstanding work ethic, being productive and pro-active in the tasks he is assigned. In addition, he is described as polite and respectful to both staff and inmates. One of the jobs he has taken on in prison is providing haircuts to inmates, including inmates in the mental health unit. Case notes expressly reveal that he conducts himself in a professional manner, has good rapport with the inmates, displaying particular patience with inmates presenting with challenging behaviours, treating them with dignity and making a positive contribution to building their self-esteem. The matters revealed in the Corrective Services case notes not only seem to me to provide support for the conclusion as to excellent prospects for rehabilitation, they indicate that there has already been significant progress towards rehabilitation.
	
	
	Fourth, the time already spent in prison appears to have had a salutary effect upon the offender. My assessment is that he has been well motivated by the experience to ensure that he never again finds himself in that position. It has been stressful for him in some respects, not least among them feeling isolated being among very few openly Shia muslims in an environment where there are reputedly a lot of ISIS supporters among the Sunni muslim population. Among other matters, the offender appears to have been genuinely effected by the significant dislocation and suffering his incarceration has caused for his wife and young daughter. I accept that he has a genuine determination to ensure that they never again have to experience the pain and dislocation which his offending has caused them.
	
	
	Fifth, beyond one driving related offence, the offender has no prior convictions.
	
	
	Before returning to the list of matters supporting my conclusions as to prospects of rehabilitation, I should as an aside deal with a matter raised in the course of the sentence hearing. The Crown tendered material described as a summary of brief material referred to in the footnotes of the Crown Statement of Facts. Objection was taken to 9 paragraphs of that document.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the material was relevant to three matters. First, whether the offender was a person of prior good character. Second, whether the offender’s involvement in drugs or drug supply was limited to dealings with the informers and UCOs. Third, as going to the question of moral culpability, in particular that the offences were committed for financial gain and not solely due to loyalty and obligation to the informers.
	
	
	The debate concerning admissibility of that material in substance centred upon the use to which that material might legitimately be put in the present exercise. I propose to admit the material to which objection was taken, but it will be evident from the whole of these reasons that I consider the Crown sought to draw much more from that material than the nature of it admits.
	
	
	I have already indicated that I consider there is much in the material that appears to demonstrate the offender talking up, or big noting, his involvement in the illicit drug trade. It seems in many respects he could talk the talk, but frequently not walk the walk.
	
	
	It will be evident from what I have already outlined that I consider there is enough in the material relating to the charged offences to conclude that a primary motivation, at least for the most significant methylamphetamine transactions, was financial gain. There is no need to resort to material of questionable import to bolster that conclusion. Where he has not been charged and there has been no relevant testing of assertions as to other offending, and nothing objective to support those assertions, I consider it neither fair nor appropriate to rely upon that material as positively establishing any particular illegal conduct on the part of the offender. The offender is being sentenced in respect of these offences alone. He has not been charged with other offending. No offending involving supply to anyone other than participants in controlled operations has been proved to a point I could sensibly rely upon it in the way the Crown asserts. I will not do so.
	
	
	So far as that material is relied upon in some sort of rebuttal of good character, in the sense that expression is conventionally understood in this context, that is, having no, or no relevant convictions, I do not rely upon it. The offender has no relevant prior convictions. I consider I am entitled to, and will, take that history into account in two ways. Firstly in according to him a degree of leniency to which he would otherwise not be entitled. Secondly, by relying upon it as one of many factors supporting my conclusion as to his prospects of rehabilitation. I will return now to the other factors supporting that conclusion.
	
	
	The sixth matter I rely upon is the offender’s expressed remorse, not just for the consequences for his family, but more broadly. In particular, his time in custody appears to have awoken him to the particular misery that frequently accompanies illicit drug use. He has expressed shame for his participation in the trade of an agent of such misery and destruction.
	
	
	All these various matters I have outlined point strongly, in my assessment, to the likelihood of the offender making a law abiding return to the community. He has the inclination and the capacity for community service generally. He is motivated to provide for the family he has so horrendously let down by his conduct. I am satisfied on the whole of the material that the prospect of him ever re-offending is at best slight.
	
	
	Notwithstanding what I have said concerning rehabilitation, that object of sentencing cannot be considered in isolation.
	
	
	The Crown submitted in this case that general deterrence is a significant factor. Naturally, as in any sentencing exercise, at least whilst it continues to have statutory recognition, appropriate account must be given to the object of general deterrence, along with all the other, some countervailing, objects of sentencing.
	
	
	However, if the notions of individualised justice, which substantially underpin the exercise of the sentencing discretion, are to be given any more than mere lip service, then the various objects of sentencing must be balanced according to the particular circumstances and features of individual cases.
	
	
	To dictate in advance that one object has any particular significance over another, divorced from a consideration of the circumstances of any particular case, for example merely by reason of the character of the offence, operates to fetter the discretion in a way that skews the balancing exercise which must necessarily be undertaken in each individual case. So to skew the exercise neither serves the interests of justice, so far as those interests are comprehended by serving the best interests of the community, nor serves the interests of justice so far as an individual offender is concerned.
	
	
	Indeed, to accord to general deterrence any peculiar significance, without any evidence base to support the proposition that there is any relevant deterrent effect achieved by sentences heavier than they might otherwise be, seems to me to run the significant risk of creating a positive injustice, particularly if other features of a case provide rational support for the proposition that the interests of justice and the community are better served by giving a preponderance of weight to other objects, such as an appropriate mix of rehabilitation and specific deterrence for example.
	
	
	It may be, in due course, there should be reconsideration of the statutory recognition of some of the presently recognised objects of sentencing, so as to reflect an appropriate evidence base.
	
	
	Whether it be by advertence to the notion of general deterrence, or by giving due weight to punishment and denunciation, recognition must be given in this exercise to the reasonable community concern about drug trafficking, particularly where it is conducted to take deliberate financial advantage of existing prohibitions. In any event, whatever might have been the motivation for the present offending, and however little thought might have been brought to bear by the offender as to the broader consequences of the offending at the time, one must acknowledge in this sentencing exercise the fact that the offender’s conduct was directed to the introduction into the community of a not insubstantial quantity of these illicit substances. It is besides the point in this respect that none of the substances did make their way into the community.
	
	
	Appropriate accord must be given to specific deterrence. I am satisfied that the case for the conclusion that the offender has excellent prospects for rehabilitation, and presents a low risk of re-offending, is compelling. However, even where the risk is low, it cannot be discounted entirely. Such risk as might exist can be managed, and the present expressed intentions of the offender for the future fortified, by structuring a sentence which takes account of a degree of specific deterrence.
	
	
	I do not doubt the offender’s expressed determination to maintain a law-abiding existence in the future. My earlier expressed conclusion as to the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation, together with my assessment that he presents a low risk of re-offending, dictate that appropriate weight must be given to the object of rehabilitation, alongside the other objects of sentencing which I have indicated must also feature in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The various considerations I have outlined must be taken into account in a way that reflects appropriate proportionality between the circumstances of the crime committed and the sentence imposed, taking appropriate account, too, of the subjective circumstances so as to properly reflect the fundamental notion of individualised justice underpinning the exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	The nature of this offending is such that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.
	
	
	However, the best interests of the community, to which the task of sentencing must ultimately be directed, are not served in my view by imposing a sentence which would be both crushing and operate to deny the community the considerable contributions which the offender is capable of making and, in my assessment, determined in the future to make.
	
	
	Furthermore, it seems to me that the various countervailing objectives of sentencing can be adequately addressed in this exercise by an appropriately structured sentence. Considerations of general deterrence, punishment and denunciation can be well addressed by a head sentence proportionate to, in particular, the objective circumstances of the offending. It seems to me that a head sentence so determined, will also contribute a necessary dimension of specific deterrence. Any risk of re-offending, to the extent it exists, can be well addressed by the knowledge that if he reoffends when he is released to parole, the offender faces the prospect of completing the whole of a substantial term of imprisonment.
	
	
	As I have sought to make clear, I am satisfied that much of the subjective material points positively to the real likelihood of the offender in the future making a substantial, law abiding contribution to the life of the community and his family. That likelihood needs to be fostered. Other than in recognition of the need for appropriate denunciation and punishment, the community gains nothing from this man’s incarceration. The need for protection of the community does not feature in this exercise. To give predominance to denunciation and punishment for their own sake would operate to perversely undermine the exercise of a discretion which depends upon notions of individualised justice. In the same way that juries are regularly encouraged to bring their common sense and experience of the world and human affairs to bear in the fulfilment of their duty, a judge exercising the sentencing discretion must likewise bring to bear her or his own experiences, both professional and personal, in assessing the likelihood of particular outcomes. That is the nature of the instinctive synthesis which sentencing comprehends. For so long as the offender is incarcerated, the community is denied in the meantime his evident capacity to make a productive and positive contribution to the life of his community and his family. There is also the risk that, if he were denied that opportunity for too long, his motivation and capacity to make a positive return to the community would be defeated, along with the substantial progress which has already been made towards rehabilitation.
	
	
	Having regard to the various matters I have outlined, I am satisfied that the minimum period that the offender must serve, in order to reflect the objective gravity of his offending in the circumstances in which it was committed, and taking appropriate account, too, of the subjective circumstances so as to properly reflect the fundamental notion of individualised justice to which I have already referred, admits of a significant finding of special circumstances in his favour.
	
	
	It is an understatement to record that it is unfortunate there is not more flexibility in the options available to a sentencing judge to achieve justice in individual cases. For example, there might be much to be said in the circumstances of the present case, in favour of the availability of some kind of intensive community based corrections order, permitting some at least of a non-parole period to be served by way of intensive supervision and punishment in the community. In the present day our prisons are filled to overflowing. The daily cost to the community of keeping a prisoner in custody is substantial. The adequate resourcing of the criminal justice system seems beyond the fiscal capacity of governments. They naturally have an assortment of priorities to balance in difficult economic times. That environment suggests a time ripe for the community to engage in serious and considered debate concerning appropriate reforms that might better meet the needs of criminal justice in the circumstances of our times. That debate should be informed and inclusive. It should not be driven by the dictates of an hysterical tabloid commentariat. Ultimately rehabilitation is the best protection of the community. There will always be cases, however, where protection of the community requires keeping a person incarcerated. However, where the immediate protection or safety of the community is not otherwise an issue, there seems to be much to recommend alternative forms of punishment. It is difficult to accept that in this day and age it is beyond the wit and wisdom of our community to devise options for imposing effective and appropriate punishment, which meet all the objectives of sentencing generally, and also represent a better application of our economic, intellectual and social capital than simply locking people in a concrete box for a pre-determined period of time.
	
	
	There was filed after the sentence hearing a supplementary submission on behalf of the offender urging the conclusion that the dog bites he suffered upon his arrest constitute a kind of extra-curial punishment that should be taken into account in his favour. I do not accept that submission. It seems to me that the injuries sustained were far from sufficiently serious to attract that characterisation and, in any event, it seems to me likely that they were occasioned by his own conduct in attempting to evade apprehension at the time.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there should be some accumulation between the two sentences, but not to any significant degree. I consider that a realistic and fair submission in all the circumstances of this case. Some accumulation is warranted, as the Crown submitted, to reflect the discrete offending, willingly engaged in, over two distinct periods of time. Otherwise, it seems to me, as the Crown submission accepted, there is an appropriate case for considerable concurrency between the two sentences. Such accumulation as there will be will be implicit, as I propose to impose an aggregate sentence.
	
	
	There was no issue but that the offender is entitled to a 25% discount in respect of each offence, to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas.
	
	
	For the offence of supply a large commercial quantity of heroin, and the offence of supply a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, the offender is convicted.
	


I impose an aggregate sentence comprising a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 29 August 2013 and expiring 28 August 2017 and a balance of term of 6 years and 9 months expiring 28 May 2024. That is a total effective sentence of 10 years and nine months and a total effective non parole period of four years.

Had I not imposed an aggregate sentence I would, after taking into account the discount for the plea in each case, and the matters on the Form 1 in respect of the second offence, imposed the following sentences:

For the offence of supply a large commercial quantity of heroin, a term of imprisonment of 6 years and nine months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 5 months.

For the offence of supply a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, a term of imprisonment of 9 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months.

		11 December 2015",2015-12-10 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768449,R v Katsis [2015] NSWSC 1890,"Judgment


	
	Alexis Katsis is to be sentenced for the rape and murder of Doris Elizabeth Fenbow on 3 September 1988. He was found guilty of those crimes on 21 October 2015 at the conclusion of his trial by jury over 12 days commencing 6 October 2015. I refer to the first count on the indictment as a charge of rape by way of shorthand for the offence of having sexual intercourse without the victim’s consent, knowing that she had not consented, contrary to s 61D(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	The maximum penalty for an offence against s 61D(1) in September 1988 was 8 years imprisonment. For murder the penalty was “penal servitude for life” pursuant to s 19 Crimes Act. But that section permitted the imposition of a lesser term in the case of a person who committed a murder when he was under the age of 18 years. By the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999 (NSW) all references in the Crimes Act to “penal servitude” were replaced with “imprisonment” from 1 January 2000.
	
	
	For some years until her death Ms Fenbow, lived in a one bedroom unit at the rear ground floor of No 53 Mirrabooka Crescent, Little Bay. No 53 was one of eight blocks of Housing Commission units, side by side on Mirrabooka Crescent. These blocks were street numbers 45 to 59.
	
	
	The offender lived in one of the units in the block at No 49 with his father, stepmother, older sister and younger half sister. He had lived there since 1980. He was born on 10 September 1970. At the date of the offences of which he has been found guilty Alexis Katsis was exactly one week short of his eighteenth birthday.
	
	
	Ms Fenbow was 66 years old when she was murdered. She was the sole occupant of her unit and she lived alone in every sense. Neighbours who gave evidence in the trial reported that Ms Fenbow appeared to have no visitors. The neighbours were not aware of her having any relatives. When she stepped out she was never seen in company. A young man named Jeremy Nicholas lived in the unit above. He appears to have had the closest contact with Ms Fenbow of anyone and that was only because he stopped to talk with her from time to time, helped her carry in groceries and assisted her to regain entry to her unit when she locked herself out.
	
	
	Ms Fenbow did not care for herself well. She had allowed her flat to become untidy and unclean, her clothes were infrequently washed and her personal hygiene was poor. The offender knew her by sight and was heard by one neighbour to refer to her as “smelly”. Ms Fenbow was a slight woman. On post-mortem examination her body weighed only 54 kilograms and she was 172 centimetres in height. To those neighbours who described her in evidence she appeared noticeably thin.
	
	
	Ms Fenbow was last seen alive by a neighbour at 6pm on Friday 2 September 1988. At about 7am on Saturday 3 September the occupants of nearby units noticed smoke coming from her unit. The Fire Brigade was called. Whilst the Brigade was on its way two of the neighbours forced entry to try to rescue Ms Fenbow but found her already deceased.
	
	
	When the Fire Brigade arrived and quelled the fire Ms Fenbow’s body was found face down on her lounge room floor with smouldering cushions beside her and under her. She was in a light slip, consistent with night clothing, and a cardigan and jacket. The slip was pulled up and she was uncovered from the waist down.
	
	
	The burning cushions under and against Ms Fenbow’s body were from her own furniture. One point of initiation of fire was in these cushions. A second was in a chair, also in the lounge room, against the wall which divided that room from her bedroom. A third seat of fire was in a fold up chair in the lounge room. A separate fire had also been lit in the mattress of Ms Fenbow’s single bed. The mattress was thrown out through the bedroom window by a fireman in the course of bringing the fire under control. Close examination of it showed that it had burned slowly, without accelerant. The bed head had also caught alight. None of the three seats of fire in the lounge room nor any of the locations to which the fire had spread showed any evidence of accelerant.
	
	
	The unit had been ransacked. In the kitchen, drawers and the doors of cupboards were open and at least one purse was open on the counter top. Hot plates of her electric stove had been left on and were glowing with heat. In Ms Fenbow’s bedroom, the drawers of her bedside table had been opened, her personal papers had been spread around and another purse had been opened. I have no doubt that Alexis Katsis initiated the fires. The ransacking of the premises may have been done by him to encourage the combustion and possibly with an initial purpose of searching for money or valuables.
	
	
	The window of Ms Fenbow’s bedroom faced to the rear of her unit block. The floor of the bedroom was at approximately the level of a grassed area outside. One large pane of glass was missing from this window. This had been broken some two weeks before her death.
	
	
	A sliding door leading from Ms Fenbow’s lounge room to a terrace outside was open about 100 millimetres. This opening together with the missing pane of glass from the bedroom window would have ventilated the fire. The Fire Brigade investigator who examined the scene gave evidence that it had burned for about one to two hours. This was admittedly a crude estimate. I infer that the fire commenced at some time around 6:00am.
	
	
	In the bedroom there was evidence of a struggle. On the floor were Ms Fenbow’s dentures, a watch with a broken strap and a small amount of blood. The autopsy report showed that the victim had been severely assaulted. Her left eye and left ear were bruised. The fingernails of Ms Fenbow’s right hand were broken. She had scratch marks on her neck and under her chin. There was a rounded red bruise under her left breast, three of her ribs on the left side had sustained fresh fractures, consistent with her having been punched or kicked or a knee being forced against her chest wall.
	
	
	The autopsy examination showed that the cause of death was asphyxiation, partly mechanical and partly chemical. Heavy bruising of Ms Fenbow’s neck muscles and damage to her voice box revealed a
	


“pattern of… injuries… typical of manual compression to the neck, as occurs in manual strangulation”.


	
	In the opinion of Dr Lyons, who gave evidence based upon the autopsy findings, the physical indications were of
	


“severe force and it is sustained in that it hasn’t been something that occurred over a few seconds, it suggests to me it might be many seconds or a few minutes.”


	
	Dr Lyons considered that the strangulation could have rendered Ms Fenbow unconscious but still breathing. That was the mechanical aspect of the asphyxiation. A “heavy amount of soot” in the deceased’s windpipe and lungs indicated that she had inhaled smoke. A blood sample showed 30% carbon monoxide saturation confirming that such inhalation had occurred and constituting the chemical component of the asphyxiation.
	
	
	The post-mortem examination showed that sexual intercourse had taken place. There was blood in the vicinity of Ms Fenbow’s vagina. The internal vaginal wall was bruised in a manner consistent with penetration. Vaginal swabs were obtained and revealed the presence of semen.
	
	
	DNA analysis of human tissue and comparison with the DNA profiles of suspects had not been developed as at late 1988. Collection of other types of forensic evidence from the unit was frustrated by the sparsity of traces and by the damage which had been done by the fire. The police interviewed many of the occupants of the units at 45 to 59 Mirrabooka Crescent but gained no leads.
	
	
	Alexis Katsis was interviewed and told police that on the Friday evening preceding Ms Fenbow’s death he had gone to the Maroubra Bay Hotel with friends. He said that he met with his sister and two other females at the hotel and remained there drinking until 2:30am. At that time, he said, he had returned to his home at 49 Mirrabooka Crescent with his sister and others, by cab. The offender said he “then went to bed shortly after arriving home and heard or saw nothing that can assist in the murder of Doris Fenbow”.
	
	
	The police investigation in late 1988 stalled in the absence of eye witnesses to the actions or movements of any possible suspect and the lack of any other useful evidence. However the case was not forgotten by the police or by forensic technical officers. By October 2003 the science of DNA analysis and profiling had advanced to the point where the retained vaginal swab samples from Ms Fenbow’s body could be profiled by the New South Wales Forensic and Analytical Science Service. A DNA profile of the sperm fraction of one swab was uploaded to a database. Detectives maintained their investigation file open.
	
	
	In March 2014 a buccal swab was taken from the offender when he commenced a term of imprisonment for offences of breaking and entering and possession of house breaking implements. A forensic biologist with the Analytical Science Service profiled the human tissue on this swab. Upon entering that profile in the database it was found to be a match with the DNA profile of the sperm fraction of the sample which had been obtained from the deceased’s vagina. On 26 May 2014 Alexis Katsis was arrested and charged on the basis of this forensic evidence. He was offered a record of interview and declined to participate.
	
	
	Evidence in the trial from a number of witnesses confirmed that the offender was at the Maroubra Bay Hotel on the evening of Friday 2 September 1988 and that he returned home by cab at about 2:30am. His sister and some other friends from the neighbourhood shared the cab.
	
	
	Having regard to the verdicts and drawing inferences from the evidence briefly summarised above, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at some time between 3am and 6am on 3 September 1988 the offender entered the deceased’s unit most likely through the broken window of her bedroom or possibly through the sliding door of her lounge room. There was no sign of entry having been otherwise forced, prior to the front door being broken down when Ms Fenbow’s neighbours attempted to rescue her from the fire after 7:00am on the morning of Saturday 3 September 1988.
	
	
	Contrary to the offender’s evidence at trial and consistently with the jury’s verdicts, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender well knew where Ms Fenbow lived. He admitted that he commonly used the path which ran behind the eight Housing Commission blocks. That path passed close to the deceased’s unit. Over several years of both Alexis Katsis and Ms Fenbow living in this neighbourhood, the offender must have observed which unit she occupied. On 3 September 1988 he targeted her, in her home.
	
	
	Having gained entry the offender took the deceased by force from her bed into the lounge room and there had sexual intercourse with her against her resistance. Either in the course of the intercourse or immediately thereafter he manually strangled Ms Fenbow. The breaking of her ribs occurred either whilst he was forcibly subduing his victim during the intercourse or in the process of him strangling her, if that occurred separately. The severe and sustained compression of Ms Fenbow’s neck, as evidenced by the muscular bruising and the damage to her voice box described by Dr Lyons, may have commenced with a purpose of preventing her from uttering any sound which would attract attention. Ultimately it was intended to cause her death.
	
	
	Having raped Ms Fenbow and manually strangled her to the point of unconsciousness, the offender ignited fires at the four locations in the unit previously described. The manner of cushions being placed under and adjacent to Ms Fenbow and of fires being started in multiple locations proves beyond reasonable doubt his intention to ensure her death and to eliminate her as a witness of his unlawful entry and of the rape. Having ignited the fires Alexis Katsis went home to bed, where his sister saw him at 8am when she went to his room to wake him.
	
	
	The offender’s attack on Ms Fenbow was savage, inhuman and despicable. A vulnerable, inoffensive, lonely old lady was taken from her bed in the small hours of the morning and violently subdued. When her frail body had been used to satisfy the offender’s short lived impulse it was discarded to the fire. Her clothing was left pulled above her waist in the state in which Alexis Katsis had finished with her. Ms Fenbow died in pain, in terror and in degradation.
	
	
	On the offender’s own account, which I have no reason to doubt, he had consumed six to eight beers and four scotches at the Maroubra Bay Hotel on the Friday night. He was affected by alcohol when he arrived home in the cab. He may still have been to some extent affected when he perpetrated these crimes but I cannot say in what degree. On the evidence of his sister he smoked a quantity of cannabis during the first 30 to 40 minutes after returning from the hotel to the family unit at No 49. Again I cannot make any finding as to the degree, if any, of his cannabis intoxication at the time when he committed his crimes. I cannot say what if any contribution intoxication, of either kind, may have made to his state of mind or to his behaviour in the early hours of Saturday morning when Ms Fenbow was raped and murdered.
	


Motive


	
	The question of whether or not the evidence proved beyond reasonable doubt that Alexis Katsis raped and murdered Ms Fenbow was solely for the jury. They answered it by their verdicts of guilty. The verdicts do not however fully determine the surrounding circumstances in which the crimes were committed, so far as those circumstances may be relevant to fixing appropriate sentences. It is my responsibility to make findings about those circumstances, applying the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt to any fact which might go towards increasing the severity of punishment and applying the lesser standard of the balance of probabilities to any fact which might ameliorate penalty.
	
	
	On the basis of only the evidence given in the trial I would have inferred beyond reasonable doubt that Alexis Katsis went to Ms Fenbow’s unit in the small hours of 3 September 1988 for the premeditated purpose of raping and murdering her. The purpose of murder would have followed from that of rape, for an intending rapist in a setting such as this could not have hoped to escape detection unless he killed his victim.
	
	
	At the sentence hearing the Crown has tendered the criminal record of the offender showing that in May 1988 he was convicted in the Children’s Court of an offence of stealing, committed on 22 October 1987. Also in that sentence hearing the offender gave evidence that during 1987 and 1988 he and his sister had had “to provide for ourselves” because their father denied them food at home. The sister’s evidence at the trial corroborated this and I have no reason to doubt this aspect of their testimony. The offender said that he worked “odd jobs up the golf course in the golf range” during 1987 and 1988 to help pay for food.
	
	
	When this additional evidence is taken together with that of the ransacking of Ms Fenbow’s unit referred to at [10], there appears a reasonable possibility that the offender may have intruded for the initial purpose of stealing any money or valuable items that he might have imagined Ms Fenbow possessed. The offender has not disputed the DNA evidence which links him directly to the sexual assault on Ms Fenbow. However he has offered an extraordinary explanation of how the sexual assault came about, which involves him having been brought into the unit against his will and with no intention either to steal from or to rape Ms Fenbow or even to be there. I will return to this purported explanation in more detail shortly. The immediate significance of it is that it has precluded him from offering any evidence of a purpose of his own for having gone there. It is therefore left to the Court to infer from the objectively proved facts whether he came with the intent of rape and murder from the outset or only with an initial objective of theft – with the violation of Ms Fenbow occurring opportunistically and the murder following upon that.
	
	
	I accept the Crown’s fair submission that the latter is a reasonable possibility. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Alexis Katsis went to and entered the unit with a purpose of rape and murder from the outset. I am not able to find to any standard of proof what his original purpose may have been.
	


Character and antecedents of the offender


	
	The offender’s father and biological mother are of Greek birth. They came to Australia before he was born. The family returned to Greece in 1972 and remained there until 1977 or 1978. They then came back to Australia. Alexis Katsis was aged 7 years when they returned. His father remarried. It is not clear whether this occurred before or after the return to Australia.
	
	
	At school in Australia from 1978 the offender had to learn English whilst at the same time trying to acquire knowledge of his school subjects. He struggled with this. There is no objective record of how well he performed at his school work, ultimately. He left school at the end of 1986, aged 16 years. He did not complete the Higher School Certificate. He attained imperfect literacy. In evidence during the sentence hearing the offender said he had been learning reading and writing in prison during the last 18 months.
	
	
	In his teens up to the date when these offences were committed the offender was athletic and active. He played cricket and rugby league in season and engaged in surfboard riding all year round. He spent half a day in the surf, on average, every weekend.
	
	
	Both the offender and his sister gave evidence that their father was harsh and capricious. The offender’s sister, three years older, described the father as “barbaric”. He inflicted corporal punishment on the offender frequently and for little or no cause. He hit both the offender and his sister. The offender described “mental abuse” by his father, involving ridicule of him for one thing or another. The offender testified in the trial that his father kept the household fridge locked and denied his children free access to it. The father appears at times to have been uncaring. On one occasion when the offender injured his leg during play in the neighbourhood his father force-marched him to a doctor in a manner which ran the risk of aggravating the leg injury, possibly to the point of doing irremediable harm. The offender and his sister testified that on the other hand their stepmother was loving, warm and caring. I accept the evidence of family circumstances referred to in this paragraph.
	
	
	The offender and his sister also gave evidence that at times they visited a paternal uncle who lived in Sydney. Whilst in the uncle’s care he too inflicted corporal punishment. According to the offender the uncle on two occasions sexually abused him. I accept on the balance of probabilities that these events occurred in the family life of the offender, prior to September 1988.
	


Alleged sexual abuse of offender by two neighbours


	
	In his evidence before the jury the offender claimed that he was sexually abused by a man named Kevin Hayward who lived in one of the units within No 47 Mirrabooka Crescent. This was said to have occurred in about 1982 or 1983. I accept that there was a man named Kevin Hayward living there at that time.
	
	
	The offender’s description of his sexual abuse by Hayward was an introductory aspect of the false narrative which he gave to the jury to try to explain the presence of his semen in the vagina of Ms Fenbow. The balance of this narrative was that, in the early the evening of Friday 2 September 1988 as the offender walked past Ms Fenbow’s unit on an innocent errand, Hayward was loitering outside her bedroom window. The path on which Alexis Katsis was walking ran past the rear of the unit blocks, parallel to Mirabooka Crescent. The offender said that Hayward pulled him into the unit where Ms Fenbow lay, already unconscious, on the lounge room floor.
	
	
	The offender said that once he was inside the unit Hayward fondled his penis, aroused him, performed oral sex on him and then pulled him into a prone position on top of Ms Fenbow and physically manipulated him to carry out the sexual act, all without volition on the offender’s part. He said Hayward dragged his body backwards, one handed, to align him to penetrate Ms Fenbow. Then, again one handed, Hayward pushed his body forward to effect the penetration whilst holding the offender’s penis in the other hand to ensure that this occurred.
	
	
	In order to explain to the jury how this could possibly have taken place the offender asserted that Hayward had “something like a control over” him which caused him to remain passive throughout, in the fear of harm that might otherwise be inflicted. This “control” was attributed to the alleged experience of sexual abuse at Hayward’s hands six years earlier. The offender told the jury that he fled Ms Fenbow’s unit after having penetrated her against his will. He said he knew nothing of how the fires were started.
	
	
	It is inherent in the jury’s verdict that they found this narrative, at least, not a reasonable possibility. I am not surprised.
	
	
	As the offender’s claim of having been sexually abused by Kevin Hayward in about 1982 or 1983 was an integral part of the exculpatory tale which the jury have rejected, I am left in great doubt as to whether he was ever abused by this man at all. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he was. His sister gave evidence in the trial to corroborate the abuse but she contradicted herself about it. On one account she said she did not see any physical act between Kevin Hayward and her brother but saw circumstances which suggested that it might have occurred. In another passage she claimed actually to have witnessed physical sexual misconduct by Hayward towards her brother. I cannot give any weight to the sister’s evidence on this subject.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence in the trial that over a period of three years, occurring between three and five years prior to September 1988, he had also been sexually abused by one Ronald Jolley. Jolley lived in the unit next to Kevin Hayward’s. Jolley was said to have been in the same school year as one of the offender’s friends, who was one year older than the offender himself. Ronald Jolley was another person whom the offender sought to weave into the rejected narrative of how he came to have intercourse with Ms Fenbow shortly before her murder. The offender told the jury that a third male was in the unit when he was forced in there by Kevin Hayward. He attempted to convey to the jury that he had thought this person might have been Jolley and that, as Jolley was another whom he feared from earlier experience, this might further explain his passivity at the hands of Hayward.
	
	
	I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Ronald Jolley ever sexually abused the offender. I am unable to give any credit to his evidence in this respect because it appears to be part of his endeavour to bolster the story of manipulated intercourse, which the jury have rejected and which I reject.
	
	
	Neither Hayward nor Jolley could be called by either the Crown or the offender, in the trial or at the sentence hearing, because both had died well before the trial.
	


Substance abuse up to the commission of the crimes


	
	On his own evidence given in the sentence hearing before me, the offender was using marijuana once or twice a day in about 1987 and 1988. He was also using LSD less frequently and consuming alcohol. He said that his substance abuse in this period resulted from him feeling depressed and confused and wishing to forget about sexual abuse and “the mental and physical [abuse] at home”. I accept that the offender was misusing alcohol and drugs to the extent he has described.
	


Personal history since the commission of the crimes


	
	About a year after Ms Fenbow was murdered the offender moved out of his father’s unit at Mirrabooka Crescent. Thereafter he lived with his sister and her young son at Matraville for about a year. In that period he worked as a machine operator at WD & HO Wills at Pagewood. Part way through 1990 he went to Greece and lived with a second uncle for a year. When he returned to Australia in 1991 he found accommodation with a friend in Maroubra and commenced work in the construction industry. This lasted for about 4 years.
	
	
	From 1994 or 1995 the offender lived in Sydney with a female partner who became his fiancée. From 1995 to 1997 the offender and his fiancée took care of the young son of the offender’s sister. She was unable to cope with the boy herself. However in 1997 the offender’s fiancée died accidentally, the offender was unable to maintain the care of his nephew alone and he was taken into care by the Department of Community Services.
	
	
	The offender says that it was at this point that he became unable to manage the stresses of his life. He attempted suicide and became addicted to heroin. He says that these setbacks caused his commencement on a course of petty criminal activity from 1997 to 2000, referred to in greater detail at [58] to [60].
	
	
	In 2000 the offender undertook drug and alcohol rehabilitation with the assistance of the Salvation Army at its facility, William Booth House. By about 2001 he was able to resume work and commenced as a bartender. With various employers he moved up to supervisory and management positions. This continued through to November 2007.
	
	
	During this period the offender commenced another relationship. His new partner gave birth to his first son in 2005. A second boy was born in late 2007.
	
	
	In November 2007 whilst the offender was working as a bar manager in Annandale he was the victim of an armed robbery. He said that following this he suffered Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and depression. Those disorders led to abuse of alcohol and other substances and to separation from the mother of his two boys.
	


Sentencing the offender many years after commission of the crimes


	
	Being imprisoned for a substantial term, commencing 27 years after he committed these crimes, will no doubt fall hard upon the offender. His being brought to justice at this stage has abruptly ended the life he has been leading. He will now not be able to participate in the raising of his two sons. He gave evidence that his partner, who met him in 2005 and was unaware of his past, has ceased contact with him in prison since the verdicts were delivered.
	
	
	The offender’s counsel submitted that in some way the additional impact of a sentence now imposed, following a long time lapse between offending and punishment, should be taken into account towards reduction of the term. However I see no justification for discounting the offender’s sentence upon such a consideration. The time lapse in this case has been from the commission of the offences until detection. It stems from the offender’s concealment of his crime. It is not a delay which can be in any degree attributed to the police, the prosecution or the Court.
	
	
	It was further submitted that there should be taken into account in mitigation of penalty the wearing effect upon the offender of a long period of uncertainty about being prosecuted and punished for these crimes. It was submitted that “where an offender has over the years between offending and apprehension experienced severe distress and anxiety as a consequence of the events that ultimately lead to [his] sentence, that may in a limited way be taken into account”. Here, not only has the long period between offending and apprehension been of the offender’s own making but I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he has during that time suffered any “severe distress and anxiety as a consequence of the events” of 3 September 1988, at all. The only evidence he gave of any recurring thoughts about the rape and murder of Ms Fenbow was when he asserted that he had often wished that he had “spoken out” so that “the people that are responsible” might have been “dealt with”. This evidence was not a genuine expression of any haunting thoughts upon Ms Fenbow’s fate. It was just a reiteration of the offender’s attribution of these crimes to others – the case that has been rejected by the jury.
	


Criminal record


	
	Since the subject crimes were committed the offender has been found guilty of numerous petty offences over the last 20 years, mostly involving dishonesty and with two common assaults. The first period of offending was from August 1997 (aged 26 years) to early 2000 (aged 29 years). During that period he was convicted of a few larcenies, possession of suspected stolen goods on a number of occasions and minor drug possessions. The penalties were fines, community service orders, and, in 2000, suspended prison sentences.
	
	
	There were two shoplifting convictions in July and November 2004 which were dealt with by the imposition of supervised bonds. In July 2005 he was convicted on five counts of using a false instrument with intent to obtain more than $15,000. When these offences were dealt with on 30 March 2007 he received a suspended sentence of imprisonment of 12 months.
	
	
	In December 2011 he committed offences of larceny, damaging property, possession of suspected stolen goods and possession of house breaking implements. Sentences of imprisonment were imposed by Burwood Local Court but on appeal the District Court at Parramatta quashed the terms of full-time custody and replaced them with suspended sentences of 12 months. On 13 March 2014 all of these suspended sentences were called up and the offender commenced full-time custody with an earliest date for release on parole fixed at 11 September 2014. It was when the offender was taken into custody on these call-ups that the first buccal swab was taken which resulted in a match to the profile of the swab sample from Ms Fenbow’s body.
	
	
	The offender’s record, which commenced nearly 9 years after the crimes for which he is now before the Court, is not a material factor in determining an appropriate sentence. On the one hand, the record does not include any significant offences of violence nor any sexual offences at all. It could not be said against Alexis Katsis that his conduct subsequent to September 1988 has demonstrated any heightened requirement for specific deterrence with respect to crimes of this nature or that future protection of the community is a pressing consideration.
	
	
	On the other hand, nor could it be said that the offender has since September 1988 lived an exemplary or blameless life which might be regarded as having redeemed in any degree his grave crimes of September 1988. The subsequent record does not attract lenience. It is essentially neutral.
	


Absence of contrition or remorse


	
	I do not consider that the offender has demonstrated any remorse for the crimes for which he is now to be sentenced. He has not even acknowledged them. On the contrary, upon the police brief having confronted him with irrefutable scientific evidence linking him to the scene he has awaited his trial and then put forward a story to explain how his semen could have been found in the vagina of the deceased at the time of her death and yet he not have intentionally had intercourse with her and been her killer. His purported explanation necessarily had to be extraordinary in order to work around the apparently incriminating forensic evidence which he could not deny.
	
	
	In the hearing on sentence Alexis Katsis gave this evidence:
	


“A. [Over the years following September 1988] …every night I used to think what if I'd done something different or spoke out but I didn't because I was afraid. I regret I haven't spoken out. …

Q. What do you mean when you say you regret that you hadn't spoken out?

A. That maybe Doris might still be alive or the people that are responsible could have been dealt with the same way I'm getting dealt with.

…

A. Well when the events took place and keeping it deep inside of me like I've just ‑ I dealt with it in a way with alcohol and drugs and hoping that the police would get the two people that were involved and save the headache from everybody.

Q. Now you adhere to your evidence at trial and to your pleas of not guilty but what can you nevertheless tell the Court in terms of what you feel for the deceased?

A. Well I feel sorry for what happened to Doris, yes. I regret not speaking out and the main person that's the victim is Doris before me or anyone and she's the one that paid the ultimate price here and I regret that I hadn't spoken out earlier to get the perpetrators did what they did here.”


	
	This is the evidence to which I referred earlier as being a post-verdict reiteration by the offender of his claim that he was not responsible for having had sexual intercourse with Ms Fenbow against her consent because he was physically manipulated to perform the act and did so without volition on his part. It is a restatement of his claim to know nothing of the circumstances in which she died. The offender’s continuing denial of responsibility for the crimes which the jury has found he committed demonstrates his lack of remorse or contrition.
	


General principles of sentencing for historical offences


	
	The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) applies to the sentencing of the offender in this case notwithstanding that it came into force after the commission of the offences: MPB v R [2013] NSWCCA 213; (2013) 234 A Crim R 576 at [23] – [25]. That Act therefore governs the methodology by which I must arrive at a sentence of appropriate length for these crimes. An exception to the application of the Act is s 44: the form of that section as in force up to April 2002 applies to the sentences now to be imposed, requiring them to be structured as head sentences with a non-parole period rather than non-parole period plus balance of term.
	
	
	I am required to determine the length of sentence having regard to general sentencing principles and patterns of sentencing for the offences in question, as they were applied at the time of commission: MPB v R at [12]; SHR v R [2014] NSWCCA 94 at [54]; RL v R [2015] NSWCCA 106 at [7], [8].
	


Youth and rehabilitation


	
	On principles which were applicable in the late 1980s and are still applicable today, the fact that Alexis Katsis was a young person when he raped and murdered Ms Fenbow is to be taken into account in his favour on sentence, albeit with limited significance given that he was so close to the age of 18 and considering the adult nature of his offences: KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51 at [26]; SHR v R at [45] – [48].
	
	
	The relevance of an offender’s youth is, in large part, that his offending may have been the product of immaturity and that prospects of rehabilitation with increasing years may appear favourable. In sentencing Alexis Katsis after the lapse of so many years the adoption of this approach is confirmed by subsequent events. I have mentioned that his conduct since 1988 has been entirely free of sexual offences and free of any significant violence. After the lapse of 27 years I see no risk of him reoffending in the manner of the crimes for which he is now to be dealt with.
	
	
	His sentence must nevertheless show the Court’s denunciation of his brutal crimes against Ms Fenbow and provide general deterrence to others. The Court’s task of balancing these competing considerations was described by the Court of Criminal Appeal in RL v R in the following terms at [46]:
	


“[46] … [T]here is a high level of tension in relation to sentencing offenders years after the events which constitute the criminal conduct, in providing adequate punishment, giving some effect to general deterrence, denouncing the conduct of the offender and recognising the harm done to the victim, in circumstances where there is no palpable risk of reoffending, no need to deter the offender, no need to protect the community from the offender nor to promote the rehabilitation of the offender.”

Aggravating circumstances


	
	Of the aggravating factors listed in s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, those which are present in the facts and circumstances summarised earlier in these remarks are para (eb) (the offences were committed in the victim’s home) and para (l) (the victim was vulnerable).
	


Consistency with sentences in comparable cases of murder


	
	The requirement that the sentence now to be passed should conform to patterns of sentencing applicable at the time of his offending (see [67] above) is a particular application of the Court’s general endeavour to achieve consistency between sentences imposed for similar crimes committed by offenders with similar subjective attributes: Wong v R (2001) 207 CLR 584; Green v R; Quinn v R (2011) 244 CLR 462.
	
	
	Both counsel have referred me to statistical studies which suggest trends in the severity of sentences imposed for murder in New South Wales over the decades from the 1980s to the present. I have not relied upon the statistical information because it does not provide any detail of the manner of commission of the murders for which individual sentences were imposed nor any description of the subjective attributes of the individual offenders. I have instead reviewed unreported sentencing remarks in a number of cases of murder and murder/rape committed in the 1980s and 1990s, with a view to gauging the measure of punishment imposed by other judges of this court in comparable circumstances.
	
	
	In R v Bossie (Supreme Court (NSW), Studdert J, 16 April 1992, unrep) the offender was sentenced for the rape and murder of a 24 year old victim on 16 February 1991. The offender had been 21 years old at the date of the offence. He had followed the victim after she left a discotheque, pulled her off the road along which she was walking into scrub, where he clubbed, strangled and raped her. He pleaded guilty on the fourth day of trial but was found by the sentencing judge to have shown no contrition. The offender had a borderline intellectual disability and was extremely immature but had no background of violent crime. He was given credit for previous good character. The sentencing judge found it difficult to assess his prospects of rehabilitation. He received a fixed term of 6 years for the rape concurrent with the sentence for murder being 20 years with a non-parole period of 14 years. For the purposes of comparing that case with the present it is important that Bossie pleaded guilty, albeit belatedly, and thereby ultimately acknowledged responsibility. The sentence reflected a degree of leniency on account of the plea, in accordance with R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604.
	
	
	In R v Sharpe (unreported, 9 September 1992, Wood J) the offender was sentenced for a murder committed on 4 August 1990, when he was 19 years old. The victim was a 43 year old woman indirectly related to the offender, being his mother’s sister in law. The offender had gone to the victim’s home for the purpose of having sexual intercourse with her, in circumstances where he believed that this was appropriate retribution for what he falsely perceived as interference by the victim in the marriage of his own parents. The offender beat the victim about the head and strangled her. The cause of death was fracture of the skull with injury to the brain. The offender had attempted unsuccessfully to have sexual intercourse with the victim.
	
	
	The offender made a strong impression upon the sentencing judge of genuine contrition and remorse. He had attempted to take his own life whilst in custody. He had abused alcohol and cannabis prior to the offence but had shown no prior propensity for violence. His plea of guilty was supported with favourable references from associates and an earlier employer. A total sentence of 18 years was imposed but with a very lenient minimum term (the then equivalent of a non-parole period) of 10 years, reflecting the sentencing judge’s favourable findings with respect to contrition, remorse and other subjective features. Considerations of that kind do not apply to Alexis Katsis. No character evidence has been called on his behalf.
	
	
	In R v Dargin [2000] NSWSC 710 Ireland AJ passed sentence for a murder committed on 30 September 1998, taking into account in the penalty an offence of aggravated sexual assault committed contemporaneously. The offender was an aboriginal man 22 years of age at the time of the murder. His victim was a 72 year old woman whom the offender had followed into her home apparently with a view to stealing from her. She died of blows to her face and head with the offender’s fists. She suffered neck injuries consistent with manual strangulation but the sentencing judge was not satisfied that the offender had attempted to strangle her. Rather these injuries were accepted to have been incidental to his subduing of the victim in the course of the sexual assault. Accordingly he was sentenced on the basis that the element of intent for murder had been established by intent to cause grievous bodily harm rather than to kill.
	
	
	The offender was on bail at the time of the offences being committed; he had a long criminal history including violence; he was intoxicated at the time of the offence, to a degree which the sentencing judge was unable to determine but which was considered not to be of any weight either in mitigation or aggravation of the offence. The offender pleaded guilty in the presence of the jury panel when the trial was about to commence, in the face of a strong Crown case upon which his Honour considered that the offender would have perceived that conviction was inevitable. The offender demonstrated no remorse and no contrition beyond the plea of guilty. A head sentence of 19 years was imposed with a non-parole period of 14 years.
	
	
	In comparing R v Dargin with the present case, there were two factors significantly more favourable to Dargin than to the present offender. The first was his plea of guilty. The second was that his intent was to inflict grievous bodily harm whereas I have found beyond reasonable doubt in the present case that Alexis Katsis’ intention was to kill Doris Fenbow by strangling and incinerating or suffocating her. In appropriate circumstances the fact that an offender intended to inflict grievous bodily harm rather than to kill may render the offence less culpable and attract a lower penalty: R v Hillsley [2006] NSWCCA 312 at [16]; R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 112 at [49] and [61]; Hoai Vinh Tran v R [2011] NSWCCA 116. In R v Dargin the sentencing judge considered that the lesser intent was material to the reduction of penalty. Balancing against those considerations, Dargin’s criminal history prior to his offence was significant whereas Alexis Katsis had no material conviction prior to 3 September 1988.
	
	
	R v Fleming [2007] NSWSC 673 concerned a rape and murder committed on 18 February 1984. Fleming was 30 years old when he murdered a young woman in a small park near Kurraba Point, Neutral Bay. The victim was strangled with a ligature. The offender had intercourse with her after death. As in the present case an arrest could only be made many years later, in 2005, when DNA profiles of samples taken from the victim’s body could be matched to the offender. Fleming maintained a plea of not guilty and expressed no contrition. He had a prior conviction for rape in Queensland for which he had been convicted in 1976. He had been sentenced to 8 years imprisonment for that crime. There were no further convictions up to the date of the murder for which he came before the Court.
	
	
	Fleming was 54 years old when sentenced by Studdert J. He had a personality disorder and suffered significant other medical problems. His Honour took into account the added hardship of custody for the offender because of his psychological and physical health conditions. After a review of a substantial sample of other sentences, his Honour imposed a term of 21 years and a non-parole period of 16 years. For the purpose of comparison with the case before me, bearing in mind the objective of achieving consistency, I have to make allowance for the fact that Fleming was sentenced as an offender with a serious prior conviction for a sexual offence and that he had been a mature adult when the murder was committed in 1984.
	
	
	In R v Matthews [2014] NSWSC 608 Bellew J sentenced an offender for a murder which had been committed on 1 February 1992. The victim was a prostitute aged 39 years whom the offender with two others had taken to an isolated bush location where sexual intercourse had occurred multiple times and the victim had been killed by blows to the head with a rock. The offender was 21 years old at the time. He had left school at the end of year 10 and had used drugs from age 12, graduating to heroin at age 16. He pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial, for which a discount of 10% on sentence was allowed. Bellew J accepted that he was genuinely remorseful. His criminal history, both before and after this murder, did not involve violence and his Honour found in it nothing to disentitle him from leniency. His prospects of rehabilitation were found to be “generally encouraging”. His Honour fixed a non-parole period of 16 years and 3 months with an additional term of 5 years and 3 months, resulting in a total sentence of 21 years and 6 months.
	


Degree of seriousness of the rape offence


	
	With respect to the offence of sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s 61D(1), I consider the manner in which Alexis Katsis perpetrated this crime places it well into the upper range of seriousness for an offence of this type, although not in the worst category of case. It will be appropriate to impose a fixed term without specifying a non-parole period as the non-parole period for the murder count will in any event result in Alexis Katsis being in custody beyond the expiry of the fixed sentence that I intend to impose for the s 61D(1) count. In arriving at the sentence for this charge which I am about to pronounce I have taken into account all of the subjective circumstances of the offender mentioned earlier in these reasons and also the aggravating factors referred to at [71]. I have had regard to the separate sentence passed for an offence of this type by Studdert J in R v Bossie.
	


Relationship between head sentence and non-parole period for murder


	
	On the murder count I will fix a head sentence and non-parole period in accordance with the terms of s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as it stood prior to the amendments effected in early 2002. For the purposes of s 44(2) I do not find any special circumstances which would justify the non-parole period being anything less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence. In particular, the remainder of the term after the non-parole period has expired will necessarily be quite long and will be ample for the rehabilitation of the offender under the supervision of the Community Corrections service.
	


Sentences imposed


	
	From 12 September 2014 the offender has been in custody, bail refused, in respect of the rape and murder charges on which he has been convicted. That time served is to count. The sentences now to be imposed upon him are therefore to be backdated to 12 September 2014.
	
	
	Taking into account all the matters to which I have referred I have determined the following sentences.
	
	
	Alexis Katsis, for the offence of sexual intercourse without consent with Doris Fenbow on 3 September 1988 I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 years to commence on 12 September 2014 and to expire on 11 September 2020.
	
	
	For the murder of Doris Fenbow on 3 September 1988 you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 20 years to commence on 12 September 2014 and to expire on 11 September 2034. I set a non-parole period for that sentence of 15 years to commence on 12 September 2014 and to expire 11 September 2029. You will be eligible to be considered for release on parole at the expiry of the non-parole period on 11 September 2029.

		11 December 2015",2015-12-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768459,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 15) [2015] NSWSC 1892,"JUDGMENT

INTRODUCTION


	
	By notice of motion filed on 13 November 2015 the accused Glen Patrick McNamara (“McNamara”) has sought a number of pre-trial orders. This judgment relates to the order sought in paragraph 9 of that motion which is in the following terms:
	


An order that evidence relating to the applicant’s attendance at the Condell Park Indoor Firearms Range on 13 May 2014 and 22 May 2014 be excluded pursuant to s. 137 of the Evidence Act 1995.


	
	As between the Crown and counsel for McNamara, the issue has been largely resolved. However, counsel for the co-accused Roger Caleb Rogerson (“Rogerson”) has made a number of submissions which require some issues to be determined.
	
	
	A Crown case statement has been filed in the proceedings. Its contents are set out in full in a number of previous judgments and accordingly I wil not repeat them. The Crown case statement sets out the context in which I must determine the present issues.
	


The evidence


	
	The notice of motion is supported by an affidavit of Abdullah Reslan, solicitor, affirmed on 28 November 2015. Annexed to that affidavit (inter alia) is a statement of Eleonora Mecham, the part owner of the Condell Park Indoor Firearms Range (“the firearms range”). Those aspects of Ms Mecham’s statement which are relevant for present purposes may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	On 2 September 2013 an incident occurred at the firearms range where a person committed suicide. As a consequence of that incident, Charles Moschoudis, who was then a barrister and was also a member of a shooting club which operated from the firearms range, was engaged by Ms Mecham to represent her and her husband at a Coronial inquest into that person’s death. Around the beginning of 2014, Mr Moschoudis came to the firearms range in the company of McNamara. He informed Ms Mecham that McNamara was assisting him with matters pertaining to the inquest.
	
	
	As a consequence, Ms Mecham had several meetings with McNamara. At one of those meetings McNamara said that he was interested in becoming a member of the club. He later completed the relevant prerequisites for membership.
	
	
	A member of the club is able to attend the firearms range and use pistols owned by the club. The club has approximately 54 pistols covering 14 different types of firearms. They include revolvers and semi-automatic pistols with calibres of 357, 38 special, 38 super, 9mm and .22.
	
	
	On 13 May 2014, McNamara attended the firearms range. Having provided his firearms licence details, he was issued with a Smith and Wesson 686 357 calibre magnum revolver. He spent about 10 minutes shooting.
	
	
	McNamara attended the firearms range again on the afternoon of 22 May 2014. On that occasion, he was issued with the same type of firearm and spent some time on the firearms range shooting.
	
	
	Photographs were taken from CCTV footage on each of these occasions.
	


The positions of the parties


	
	It was the Crown’s original intention to lead evidence of both occasions on which McNamara attended the firearms range by calling Ms Mecham to give the evidence outlined above, and by tendering the photographs. Counsel for McNamara initially raised an objection to that course, thus giving rise to the need to include paragraph 9 in the notice of motion. However when the matter came before me for hearing I was informed that an agreement had been reached between the Crown and Counsel for McNamara that the Crown would:
	



	
	restrict the evidence to the oral evidence of Ms Mecham regarding the first occasion on which McNamara attended;
	
	
	not lead evidence of the second occasion; and
	
	
	not tender the photographs taken on either occasion
	



	
	Notwithstanding that this course was agreed to by Counsel for McNamara, counsel for Rogerson submitted the evidence of the events of 22 May (including the photographs) remained relevant and should be admitted. It was submitted, in particular, that in light of the duress which is to be asserted by McNamara as part of his defence, “his conduct on 22 May at the firing range doing something consistent with what he was doing on 13 May is relevant” (at T24 L2-3). Counsel submitted that such evidence be admitted into evidence notwithstanding the agreement which had apparently been reached between the Crown and counsel for McNamara. He submitted that any prejudice could be overcome by an appropriate direction.
	
	
	Counsel for Rogerson also submitted that in light of the agreement reached between the Crown and counsel for McNamara that the evidence of McNamara’s attendance on 13 May should be led, the photographs taken on that day should also be tendered.
	
	
	The Crown’s position was that if the relevance of the evidence sought to be relied upon by Rogerson could be demonstrated, the Crown would lead it. However, the Crown submitted that nothing had been advanced on behalf of Rogerson which established that the evidence was relevant. It was submitted, in particular, that the evidence was not relevant to any issue of duress.
	
	
	Counsel for McNamara submitted that if I were persuaded that the evidence of the attendance on 22 May was relevant, it would remain necessary to balance its probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice. In this regard, it was submitted that there was a clear potential for the jury to attach greater weight to that evidence than was warranted, to the point where the evidence could be misused. It was submitted, in particular, that the photographs gave rise to a real danger that the jury would impermissibly use them to reason (inter alia) that McNamara was a person who liked to shoot guns, who was able to shoot them, who was very familiar with them and who, as a consequence, was the kind of person who would shoot and murder the deceased. Counsel for McNamara took the same position in respect of the photographs taken on the occasion of McNamara’s first attendance at the firearms range.
	


Consideration


	
	McNamara’s attendance at the firearms range on 13 May 2014 was only a short time before the deceased was shot and killed. On the Crown case, McNamara was in the storage shed at the time of the killing. The fact that McNamara was at a firing range, practicing shooting a pistol at a target one week before the deceased was shot and killed, is clearly relevant. Counsel for McNamara properly accepted that this was so and withdrew her initial objection to it.
	
	
	However, the relevance of the evidence of McNamara’s attendance at the firearms range on 22 May is less clear. That attendance occurred after the murder of the deceased. Needless to say, the mere fact that an event occurs after an alleged offence does not, of itself, render evidence of that event inadmissible. The fundamental consideration is one of relevance having regard to the provisions of s. 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”).
	
	
	In my view, evidence of McNamara’s attendance at the firearms range after the deceased’s murder is not (in terms of s. 55 of the Act) capable of rationally affecting, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of any fact in issue in the proceedings. Even if I came to the view that the evidence was relevant, I would exclude it pursuant to the provisions of s. 137 of the Act on the basis that it would have the potential to be misused by a jury in the way suggested by counsel for McNamara. For these reasons any evidence of McNamara’s attendance at the firearms range on 22 May, including the photographs, should also be excluded.
	
	
	That leaves the question of the admission of the photographs of McNamara’s attendance at the firearms range on 13 May. Although, as I have outlined, the Crown proposes to lead evidence from Ms Mecham of that attendance, it is proposed to tender the photographs. Counsel for McNamara agrees with that course. Counsel for Rogerson presses for their admission.
	
	
	For the reasons that I have given, the evidence of McNamara’s attendance at the firearms range on that day is relevant. For the same reasons, the photographs are also relevant. The issue is whether or not they ought be excluded pursuant to s. 137 of the Act.
	
	
	There are four photographs in question which depict:
	



	
	McNamara’s vehicle arriving at the car park of the firearms range;
	
	
	McNamara entering the firearms range;
	
	
	McNamara inside the firearms range and seemingly preparing to undertake shooting; and
	
	
	McNamara engaged in shooting at a target within the firearms range.
	



	
	For the purposes of the present argument, the issue centres upon the photographs in (iii) and (iv). I have already outlined the basis on which the Crown seeks to lead the evidence of McNamara’s attendance at the firearms range on this day. The photographs add little or nothing to that evidence. More importantly however, the submission made by counsel for McNamara in respect of the potential for misuse of the photographs of McNamara’s attendance at the firing range on 22 May applies equally to those photographs taken on 13 May. In these circumstances the photographs should not be admitted.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	For these reasons, I make the following orders:
	



	
	evidence of photographs of the attendance of McNamara at the firearms range on 13 May 2014 is excluded.
	
	
	evidence of the attendance of McNamara at the firearms range on 22 May 2014, including the photographs pertaining to that attendance, is excluded.

		15 June 2016",2015-12-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768461,R v Dasilva [2015] NSWSC 1909,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: By Notice of Motion filed on 8 December 2015 the Accused, Ricardo Francis Herman Dasilva, seeks the following orders:
	



	
	that the trial date from 26 April 2016 to 14 June 2016 be vacated and that the matter be remitted to the Local Court for a committal hearing;
	
	
	that the venue of the Accused's trial be changed from the Newcastle Supreme Court to the Supreme Court sitting in Sydney;
	
	
	such other order as the Court thinks fit.
	



	
	In support of those claims for relief, there have been read, in the Accused’s case, an affidavit of the Accused sworn 4 December 2015 and the affidavit of Mohammad Tehseldar affirmed 9 December 2015. In addition, a document entitled “Application to Waive a Committal Hearing” dated 8 October 2014 has been tendered and is Exhibit A.
	
	
	The Crown has read, on this application, the affidavit of Marguerite Vassall sworn 14 December 2015.
	


Factual Background


	
	A chronology of relevant events is important to the determination of this application.
	
	
	On or about 16 May 2010, Amanda Carter was murdered at Woongarrah, a location on the Central Coast of New South Wales. The Crown alleges that it was the Accused who murdered Ms Carter. There had been a pre-existing relationship between the Accused and Ms Carter which, according to the Crown Case Statement, had broken down. Ms Carter was found lying in her bed with severe injuries to her head.
	
	
	On 30 November 2013, the Accused was arrested and charged with the murder of Ms Carter.
	
	
	The proceedings came before the Wyong Local Court where they were stood over from time to time until 8 October 2014. On that date, the Magistrate committed the Accused for trial.
	
	
	In taking that course, the Magistrate noted that the solicitor for the Accused had signed an application to waive a committal hearing for the purpose of s.68 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. That provision allows a Magistrate to commit a person for trial without a committal hearing, in circumstances where the Accused so applies and the prosecution consent to that course. Exhibit A indicates that the Accused's then solicitor made a waiver application on his behalf.
	
	
	The Accused appeared in the Supreme Court before me in the Arraignments List on 5 December 2014, on which occasion he was represented by Ms Evers of counsel. He was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty to the charge of murder, and a trial was fixed for the Sydney Supreme Court commencing on 24 August 2015.
	
	
	The matter came before RA Hulme J, the allocated trial Judge, on dates in April, July and August 2015.
	
	
	On 14 August 2015, his Honour was informed that the Accused had determined finally to withdraw his instructions from his legal representatives, that issue having been flagged at an earlier mention.
	
	
	On 21 August 2015, Mr Flynn of counsel appeared for the Accused, instructed by Mr Tehseldar, the solicitor who remains the solicitor on the record for the Accused. In circumstances where the trial date was only three days away, the defence applied to vacate the trial and his Honour acceded to that application.
	
	
	The matter came before me once again as Criminal List Judge on 11 September 2015. At that time, Mr Flynn of counsel, appeared and a trial was listed in the Supreme Court at Newcastle on 26 April 2016.
	
	
	On 5 November 2015, the matter came before RA Hulme J again for mention. Mr Flynn advised his Honour that he could not continue in the matter and that new counsel was to be briefed.
	
	
	In early December 2015, email contact was made with the chambers of RA Hulme J, indicating that Mr Scragg of counsel would now appear for the Accused and that certain pretrial applications were to be made.
	
	
	That contact culminated in the filing of the Notice of Motion on 8 December 2015 which is before me today for hearing.
	


Application for Remittal to Local Court for Committal Proceedings


	
	The first paragraph of the Notice of Motion seeks that the present trial date be vacated, to allow the proceedings against the Accused to be remitted to the Local Court for a committal hearing. In support of this claim for relief, the affidavit of the Accused sworn 4 December 2015 states that the waiver given by his then solicitor on 8 October 2014 before the Wyong Local Court, was given without the consent of the Accused. He states in his affidavit that at no time did the solicitor obtain his consent, or obtain instructions to waive his right to a committal hearing.
	
	
	The Accused states in his affidavit that he wishes to have a committal hearing so counsel can consider whether to seek to have witnesses attend and give evidence pursuant to an order under s.91 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, and so that counsel could put submissions as to why he should not be committed for trial pursuant to ss.64 and 66 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	I should note that the affidavit of Ms Vassall, relied upon by the Crown, indicates that efforts have been made to contact the solicitor then appearing for the Accused, so as to obtain his account concerning the contents of the Accused's affidavit, but that no response has been received from that solicitor.
	
	
	The Crown submits, that whether or not the Accused consented to the waiver of committal, the point has long passed when any useful remedy could be sought by the Accused with respect to such an alleged shortcoming.
	
	
	It is not necessary, for the purpose of this application, to make any final determination on the question of what happened at the Wyong Local Court on 8 October 2014. I will proceed upon the basis, by way of assumption, that what the Accused asserts is what happened. I emphasise that I am not making any finding to that effect for the purpose of this application. The real question is what would flow if such a state of affairs was established.
	
	
	Decisions of the Court of Appeal, and of single Judges of this Court, have emphasised a number of matters.
	
	
	Firstly, the holding of committal proceedings is not a condition precedent to a trial on indictment in the Supreme or District Court: R v Butler (1991) 24 NSWLR 66; Sergi v Director of Public Prosecutions (Court of Appeal, 10 September 1991, unreported, BC9101577); V v McDonald (Court of Appeal, 16 February 1995, unreported, BC9504205); Potier v Magistrate Maloney & Ors [2005] NSWSC 336; Crowe v Director of Public Prosecutions [2015] NSWSC 747.
	
	
	Secondly, where a bill of indictment has been found, the effect is that the criminal proceedings against a person, in the position of the Accused, have been commenced, in effect, in the higher Court. The authorities that I have referred to (at [23] above) demonstrate clearly that the Crown exercises prosecutorial discretion in filing a bill and that once that happens, it is rare in the extreme that the higher Court would consider taking any step other than to proceed with the trial. The exception to that may be in a case where it could be demonstrated that it would be an abuse of process to proceed to trial. That is not asserted here, nor, on my understanding of the case, could it be asserted.
	
	
	The argument here, at its highest, is that the Accused, but for the waiver of the committal, would have wished to apply to have witnesses attend to be cross-examined at the committal proceeding. For that to happen, it would have been necessary for substantial reasons to be identified and found by a Magistrate: s.91 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. It has been acknowledged fairly by Mr Scragg, who appears for the Accused, that he is not in a position at present to identify any witness in relation to whom such a submission could be put.
	
	
	The other aspect, of which the Accused complains, is that he wishes to have a committal proceeding so that an argument could be put to a Magistrate as to why he should not be committed for trial: ss.64 and 66 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The Crown Case Statement summarises what is clearly a circumstantial case but one which, on its face, appears to be a substantial case against the Accused. It is difficult to see that there would have been any real prospect of the Accused not being committed for trial.
	
	
	It was submitted by Mr Scragg that the position may be different if witnesses attended for cross-examination. That, of course, is an entirely theoretical state of affairs. It is difficult to see that any cross-examination of witnesses, in the context of this case, would have given rise to any realistic prospect of discharge at committal.
	
	
	But even if the Magistrate had discharged the Accused at committal, the Crown has already determined to proceed in the Supreme Court, and in fact has done so. The case has long passed the entry point to this Court. It is more than a year since the Accused was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the charge. One trial date has been fixed and vacated, and another trial date has now been fixed.
	
	
	It may be inferred that there have been issues between the Accused and his legal representatives which have caused some delay, but the simple fact is that this Court is seized of this matter. Even if there was some irregularity of some sort with respect to the committal proceeding (and I am not so finding), the outcome is clear that this Court would decline to intervene because the matter is in the Supreme Court for trial.
	
	
	It remains open to the Accused to make pretrial applications in this Court. I say nothing about the merits of any possible application. I am merely echoing what has been said in earlier decisions where an argument has been advanced relating to suggested deficiencies in committal proceedings.
	
	
	I decline to vacate the trial date fixed for 26 April 2016 and I decline to remit the matter to the Local Court. The relief sought in paragraph 1 of the Notice of Motion is refused.
	


Application for Change of Venue of Trial


	
	I turn then to the application by the Accused for a change of venue of the trial from Newcastle to Sydney.
	
	
	In this respect, I note that the Court is considering an application to change venue for the purpose of s.30 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. That provision states that, in any criminal proceedings, if it appears to the Court that a fair or unprejudiced trial cannot otherwise be had or that, for any other reason, it is expedient to do so, the Court may change the venue, and direct the trial be held in such other district or at such other place as the Court thinks fit and may for that purpose make all such orders as justice appears to require.
	
	
	The principles to be applied on such an application have been referred to in a number of decisions. It is sufficient to refer to the judgments of Badgery-Parker AJ in R v Privett [1999] NSWSC 1074 and of Harrison J in R v Rawlinson [2013] NSWSC 1722.
	
	
	When an accused person seeks a change of venue, he bears the onus of demonstrating to the Court, relevantly for present purposes, that a fair or unprejudiced trial cannot otherwise be had: R v Privett at [4]; R v Rawlinson at [10].
	
	
	In support of the change of venue application, the Accused relies upon the affidavit of Mr Tehseldar, which annexes a significant number of press printouts, revealing substantial media publicity surrounding the discovery of the body of Ms Carter and the subsequent police investigation, and of aspects of the Accused and his past relationship with Ms Carter.
	
	
	There are some 22 articles annexed to the affidavit - three of them in fact originate from Newcastle, seven are “The Sydney Morning Herald” articles and six are “The Daily Telegraph” articles. Three are from the “Central Coast Express Advocate”.
	
	
	It may be accepted that the circumstances of the death of Ms Carter and the subsequent police investigations did attract wide publicity, in particular on the Central Coast and, to an extent, in Newcastle and Sydney. There is reference in particular to the fact that Ms Carter was a well-known local figure in the sport of soccer. She coached a team and also refereed in the Wyong and Newcastle areas, and these matters were touched on from time to time in the media clippings. It may be accepted then that there was wide publicity of these matters, albeit for a period mainly in 2010 but also into 2013 and 2014.
	
	
	It is not unexpected that the circumstances of an alleged murder, and the charging of a person with that murder, will attract publicity: Dupas v The Queen [2010] HCA 20; 241 CLR 237 at 250-251 [36]. The question really is whether the position is such that a fair or unprejudiced trial of the Accused cannot be held in Newcastle.
	
	
	The Court must approach applications of this sort bearing in mind two important matters. Firstly, the trial Judge will, as part of the process of selection of a jury, ensure that the jury panel is made aware of persons who will be the subject of the trial, including Ms Carter and her background and involvement in the community: s.38(7) Jury Act 1977. Experience shows that members of the panel who know a person associated with a trial will seek to be excused for that reason.
	
	
	The second aspect, which is of fundamental importance, is that courts operate on the basis that persons selected to serve on juries will act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial Judge. Spigelman CJ has observed, that the days when juries were regarded as fragile, and open to the influence of what they may read in the media, are long gone: R v Jamal [2008] NSWCCA 177; 72 NSWLR 258 at 261 [17].
	
	
	Contemporary juries are independent, and take seriously their oaths or affirmations to deal with a matter in accordance with the evidence: R v Jamal at 262 [21]; Dupas v The Queen at 247-249 [26]-[29].
	
	
	In a particular case, it may be that evidence concerning possible local prejudice is so overwhelming that those considerations may be outweighed, but this is not such a case.
	
	
	In my view, it is appropriate to proceed upon the basis that a Newcastle jury, empanelled after appropriate jury selection measures, will try the Accused fairly and in accordance with the evidence and directions given by the trial Judge.
	
	
	Accordingly, I decline to change the venue of the trial, which remains as a trial fixed for the Newcastle Supreme Court on 26 April 2016.
	


Conclusion


	
	The Accused’s Notice of Motion filed 8 December 2015 is dismissed.

2768462,R v Beard [2015] NSWDC 399,"Sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Guy Cully Beard appears today for sentence in relation to two offences for which he pleaded guilty at the Local Court.
	
	
	The two offences are respectively, driving a motor vehicle when it was involved in an impact, occasioning grievous bodily harm to Matthew Hutchinson, when he was driving in a manner dangerous to other persons, committed on 12 January 2015 at Surry Hills. This is an offence contrary to s 52A(3)(c).
	
	
	The second offence to which he pleaded guilty at the Local Court and was committed for sentence, is an offence contrary to s 52AB(2) on the same date, at the same place, failing to stop and render assistance after his vehicle had impact with the motor cycle ridden by Mr Hutchinson. The impact caused grievous bodily harm to that person.
	
	
	Each of these offences carries a maximum penalty of seven years’ imprisonment. There is no standard non parole period in respect of either offence.
	
	
	There are also to be taken into account in sentencing the prisoner for the principal offence, which is the driver manner dangerous cause grievous bodily harm offence - seven matters on a Form 1. These matters all arise out of the sequelae, if I could use that expression, or the aftermath, of the driving in a manner dangerous, giving rise to the principal charge and the related offence.
	
	
	The offences are respectively, behaving in an offensive manner in a public place, ‘resisting a police officer contrary to s 58, the Crimes Act 1900’, two separate offences of ‘refusing to submit to breath testing’ and ‘refusing to submit to breath analysis’ under the relevant clauses of the Road Transport Act, ‘driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or other drug’, ‘not giving particulars to a driver of damaged property relating to a collision’ occurring, as I understand it almost immediately after the impact causing grievous bodily harm to Mr Hutchinson, and ‘not give driver particulars to police’.
	
	
	Each of those offences are directly dealt with in the detailed statement of facts which in the first three or four paragraphs, set out the events either contributing to or immediately after the primary offences, but which go on to detail the character of the prisoner’s behaviour after the event. I am informed by the prisoner’s counsel that the prisoner on 12 January 2015, before he had involved himself in the collisions which are set out in the facts, had driven from Botany Road in Redfern to Crown Street, Surry Hills. The prisoner was driving a Holden Rodeo, registered number BZ 28 UU. He was driving in a northerly direction along Crown Street, Surry Hills which is a sealed road with one lane of traffic in each direction - one direction going south, the other direction going north, divided by a double unbroken centre line. The applicable speed limit in Crown Street at this point is 40 kilometres per hour, which is relatively signposted. The facts state:
	


“In the immediate vicinity, are small businesses and residential properties. The vehicular and pedestrian traffic was heavy at the time.”


	
	12 January 2015 was a weekday and as I said, shortly after 5pm, the prisoner had his first collision with another vehicle when he was seen to accelerate his vehicle harshly, causing it to fishtail up Crown Street. The front near side tyre of the vehicle, collided with the western kerb alignment. He then crossed the double centre unbroken line, causing the entirety of the vehicle to be within the southbound lane of traffic although he was heading in a northerly direction.
	
	
	The prisoner’s car then swerved harshly to the left. However, the rear offside of the prisoner’s vehicle collided with a Honda motorcycle, registered number 0ER33, ridden by Mr Hutchinson, who was wholly within the southbound lane of Crown Street. The prisoner re entered the northbound lane and stopped momentarily, before then accelerating away harshly, as it is described in the facts, failing to stop and render assistance to the victim.
	
	
	These are the bare facts in relation to the two committal for sentence offences.
	
	
	He then crossed over double unbroken centre line and overtook numerous vehicles that were stationary at a red traffic signal on Crown Street. He disobeyed the red traffic signal and turned left into Devonshire Street and accelerated away harshly. He continued to travel at speed and came into collision with another Holden Rodeo, registered numbered AQ99GU, that was parked along Steel Street. He failed to stop after colliding with this vehicle and was later seen driving in an easterly direction on Phillip Street, Waterloo, by officers at Botany Bay Highway Patrol.
	
	
	The Court Attendance Notices prepared at the time of his arrest, gave the prisoner’s address as Morehead Street, Redfern. The prisoner was stopped on Young Street, in close proximity to the intersection of Phillip Street. He failed to produce his driver’s licence and used offensive language towards the police. He eventually complied with exiting the vehicle but he was unsteady on his feet and appeared to be affected by intoxicating liquor or an illicit drug. He had suffered a form of injury to his mouth and was bleeding but kept yelling at police, amongst other things, “fuck off cunt, fuck you”. He was restrained by police who put handcuffs on him. He kept on shouting abuse at the police in various ways, which I need not dilate upon. But he was slurring his words, his eyes were bloodshot and he smelt heavily of intoxicating liquor. He clearly was under the influence of some substance.
	
	
	The accused showed signs of what were described in the facts as, “irrational behaviour”, and then would show signs of calmness and then he would explode with “bursts of verbal abuse towards police”. When he was cautioned by police he became aggressive. He twisted his body back and forth and became difficult to restrain. Eventually, he had to be forced to the ground for him to be subdued. He was told that he was required to undergo a breath test by exhaling air from his lungs into a device, held by the police officer. He was told if he did not do it, it would be an offence. The prisoner said, “Fuck off get that away from me”. He refused to supply a relevant breath sample, twisted his head away and spat a large amount of saliva with blood in it towards the officer attempting to submit him to a blood test.
	
	
	While police were awaiting the arrival of a caged vehicle, the prisoner continued to use offensive language, continually using the words, “fuck off and fuck you”. This caused a large number of residents and motorists to stop and watch his behaviour. He was told on many occasions to stop swearing but he ignored the requests. He was taken to Redfern Police Station and entered into custody and then was requested to undertake breath analysis. He refused to exit the dock area and enter the breath analysis room. Upon being cautioned by the police, he told them to, “get fucked”. He was asked if he had received any medical or dental treatment in recent times and he said to the police officer, “No get fucked you cunt”. Asked if there was any reason that would prevent him supplying a sample of his breath, he said, “Yeah you’re a cunt”. He was given three separate opportunities to supply a sample of breath analysis but he refused to do so.
	
	
	Various other administrative steps were then taken and because there was a serious motor vehicle collision reported, involving the prisoner’s car - or police believed that to be so - and there was serious injury to a person, an interim order for a forensic procedure was sought to get a sample of his blood for analysis. This was granted by the duty manager. The prisoner was still abusive towards police. A doctor attended at the police station at 1am the following morning and conducted the forensic procedure and a blood sample was taken.
	
	
	The results of the blood sample returned a positive reading for cannabis. There was a negative reading for alcohol. Dr Judith Perl, a respected scientist expressed the opinion that there would have been some impairment of his driving ability at the time of the collision on the results of that blood test.
	
	
	Various other investigations were later undertaken. Police attended upon Silverwater Remand Centre to speak to the prisoner on 24 February.  A standard form of demand for driver and passenger identification and vehicle information suspected of being involved in indictable offences was read to the prisoner. He was warned that if he failed to reply, he would be committing an offence under the LEPRA. When asked who the driver of the vehicle that he now admits driving at the time was, the prisoner simply stated, “No comment”. He refused the participate in an electronic interview which is his right and refused to sign any documentation.
	
	
	On 25 March 2015 police from the Crash Investigation Unit attended Silverwater Gaol and listened to telephone call recordings between the prisoner and his mother. At 2.34pm on 4 March the prisoner whilst in custody spoke with his mother. During this telephone conversation the prisoner said:
	


“I get the brief on the 10th so I still don’t know if old mate was injured or not but as long as I, but as long as like I don’t think he was, as long as I didn’t hurt him and I hit the bloke on the motorbike I should be pretty right. Yes. So we will see, we will just see what happens”.


	
	The victim in fact was taken to St Vincent’s Hospital and I have seen some medical records in relation to his treatment. He was found to have suffered a comminuted fracture of the right patella, or kneecap, that required tension band wiring and an open wash out and cleaning of the open wound. He was placed in an extension splint and that was in place for approximately six weeks.
	
	
	The victim has in accordance with the Act provided a victim impact statement which attaches a photograph showing the scarring to his knee, the wiring of his knee and other matters. He states that he ended up having his leg in a splint for four months. He was unable to undertake household duties. He was a self-employed man. He was not able to receive any income, has not been receiving any income since the accident, has not been able to pay mortgage or car loan repayments and this has put enormous stress upon his family. He is a married man with children.
	
	
	He had to have a second operation to remove the wire and screw that were used to hold his knee together. He has not been able to drive for in excess of ten months. He has difficulty walking upstairs and his knee will probably require further surgery. He describes 2015 as:
	


“The worst year of my life of my life both financially and physically”,


	
	not to mention the stress upon his family. I appreciate the victim impact statement has not been subject to oath nor cross-examination, but the truth is that the victim suffered grievous bodily harm in a delicate area of the body and it has caused him continuing hardship over a lengthy period of time.
	
	
	The prisoner has a criminal history that goes back quite some time and is one which reflects offending in a range of ways during that period of time. The prisoner had a number of appearances in the Children’s Court through 1995, 96 and 97. As an adult he has a number of appearances in the Local Court and he has one appearance in the District Court for various types of offences ranging from acts of violence to acts of dishonesty to the mishandling of motor vehicles.
	
	
	So far as his driving record is concerned to deal with that, although it is not the only relevant matter, he has a conviction in the Central Local Court on 5 May 2003 for driving under the influence of alcohol or another drug from an offence committed on 7 September 2002, and two convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol or drug and driving in a manner dangerous to the public or furiously or recklessly, each committed on 30 October 2002. In respect of those matters as I understand the orders of the Court, he was ultimately disqualified for five years and sentenced to terms of imprisonment which are more detailed in the criminal history which is provided to the Court in the Crown bundle.
	
	
	In respect to the drive under the influence of alcohol or other drugs matter committed in October 2002, he was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of six months. In respect of the drive vehicle either recklessly, furiously or in a speed or manner dangerous to the public he was likewise sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of six months. Those sentences commencing presumably from the date that he came into custody 11 November given that he was sentenced from 5 May 2003.
	
	
	The prisoner has other convictions, failing to quit licensed premises and assaulting police officers in November 2001, possessing a prohibited drug, an offence committed in May 2002 for which he was fined $1,500. In October 2002 he was convicted of possessing a prohibited drug and imprisoned for six months. He was also convicted and sentenced in May 2003 for offences of common assault and custody of a knife in a public place to terms of imprisonment of six months, obviously run concurrently with a non-parole period for the other matters.
	
	
	He appeared at the Sydney District Court on 24 April 2003 and was convicted and sentenced on indictment, it would seem, for an offence of either maliciously or recklessly destroying or damaging property and was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of six months. At the same time he was dealt with in relation to the drink driving or drug driving matter to which I earlier referred. He was convicted of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty, destroying and damaging property and threatened to cause injury to potential witnesses for which offences he received s 9 good behaviour bonds. He was also imprisoned for six months at that time in respect of the first of the drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs matter committed on 7 September 2002.
	
	
	Subsequently in 2006 he was convicted of possession a prohibited drug, possessing housebreaking implements in 2007 for which he received three months’ imprisonment. He was convicted in 2007 of behaving in an offensive manner in a public place and having goods in custody reasonably suspected of being stolen or unlawfully obtained, sentenced to one month imprisonment in respect of each matter. He was further convicted in April 2007 of damaging property by fire or explosive, behaving in a manner dangerous to the public, having in his custody an offensive implement in a public place, damaging property and common assault to a total of eight months’ imprisonment, all those offences apparently committed on 11 February having previously committed the previous two offences on 8 February 2007.
	
	
	He was convicted in 2001 of dishonestly obtain property by deception for which he was fined a modest amount. He was convicted of larceny in January 2012 for which he was fined. He was also convicted in 2012 for behaving in an offensive manner and convicted of a common assault for which he was placed on a 12 month good behaviour bond.
	
	
	He was convicted in 2013 of resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty, resisting and hindering police in the execution of their duty, having in his custody a knife in a public place, for which he received convictions under s 10A of the Act. For goods in custody suspected of being stolen or unlawfully obtained, another offence committed at the same time, he was sentenced to two months imprisonment.
	
	
	That brings us to the most substantial of his more recent offences for which he was on bail when he committed the offences with which I am concerned. I had the appeal against the severity of those sentences before me, and reading from the Crown cover sheet he committed an offence of common assault on two separate occasions at Dee Why on 19 November 2014. For those matters when he was dealt with at the Manly Local Court, as I understand, on 16 September 2015, he was sentenced to four months imprisonment.
	
	
	On 20 November 2014 he committed the offence of intimidate police officer in the execution of his duty without causing actual bodily harm. For that offence he was sentenced to seven months imprisonment. In respect of an offence of having goods in personal custody suspected of being stolen, or unlawfully obtained, committed on 27 November 2014 he was sentenced to one month imprisonment. For an offence of destroy or damage property with intent to injure, committed on 15 December 2014 at Balgowlah, he was sentenced to three months imprisonment and ordered to pay a modest amount of compensation.
	
	
	The detail of these sentences reflects the fact that he was ultimately sentenced to a total of seven months imprisonment - all the terms of imprisonment were concurrent one with the other - dating from 15 January 2015. That means in effect that he appeared before me for sentence in relation to the matters with which I am directly concerned in circumstances where he had been for part of the time since 12 January when he was arrested in custody in relation to other matters. But it would appear when he was sentenced in the Magistrate’s Court all the sentences were fixed to commence from 15 January, so he missed out on three days credit between 12 January and 15 January.
	
	
	What I have resolved to do is to commence any relevant sentences I have to impose from 12 May 2015, which means that the sentences I impose are partially accumulative upon the sentences fixed at the Magistrate’s Court. But I am fixing the sentences to start from 12th of the month, not the 15th of the month, to give the prisoner that three days credit.
	
	
	There is a pre-sentence report prepared in relation to the prisoner. The prisoner has previously of course been under supervision of Community Corrections, or the Probation and Parole Service as it was known. He has previously been on parole, and has been subject to s 9 bonds, which apparently he has successfully completed. His response to previous supervision was “deemed to have been satisfactory”. It is also to be observed that, as I have pointed out from his record, he has regularly continued to offend.
	
	
	He is not married, he does not have any children, and - as I understand it - at the time of coming into custody he had no place of fixed abode. He had been living with a friend in Waterloo, but that option is no longer available to him.
	
	
	He grew up in Western Sydney but his mother was exposed to a degree of domestic violence. His father was an abuser of alcohol and drugs, as I understand it, and the family had to relocate frequently to avoid threats from the father, leading to much disruption to his education. His mother apparently lives in Queensland, as do two of his three siblings.
	
	
	He left school at about the age of fifteen. He had some learning difficulties, and since leaving school he has worked - according to Community Corrections - on a casual basis in various employments, although he was unemployed for 12 months prior to his arrest in relation to the current matters, receiving the Newstart Allowance.
	
	
	As it reflects upon the facts of the case, his admission of guilt in relation to ‘driving under the influence’ and the use of cannabis has relevance to the offending with which I am concerned. Although he is specifically charged with driving in a manner dangerous by reason of the character of his control of the vehicle, I note that he told the Community Corrections Service that he was “under the influence of cannabis” at the time of the offences, claiming to be poly-drug dependent, using cannabis and methylamphetamine on a regular basis, although there is no suggestion of methylamphetamine in his bloodstream at the time of the offending on this occasion. He also was a heavy drinker of alcohol.
	
	
	He had undertaken a residential rehabilitation programme in Queensland and attended a detoxification clinic in Sydney. But he said that he was in need of further intervention, which is self-evident.
	
	
	So far as his attitude to the offending was concerned - again to emphasise how unfit he was to be in control of a motor vehicle at the relevant time - the prisoner sought, according to the Community Corrections Service, to minimise his behaviour by referring to the fact that he was “acting under the influence of illicit drugs”.
	
	
	He did not have any expression of remorse for the victim, or the consequences of his behaviour, and I have seen no evidence of victim empathy at all in this matter.
	
	
	He needs particular assistance on release in relation to education and employment, accommodation, alcohol and drug problems, and of course his general attitude. So far as the future is concerned it will be a matter for the Community Corrections Service to determine what programme will be appropriate for the prisoner. He is assessed as being in a medium/high risk of re-offending. His record and his behaviour in relation to the matters with which I am concerned shows that to be self-evidently true.
	
	
	He was co-operative in the interview process, was said to have provided a “frank account of his antecedents” and acknowledged the correlation between his substance abuse and his offending behaviour, and the need for what were described as “urgent interventions”. However his lack of a fixed place of abode does limit the scope of the Community Corrections at this point to identify a particular programme that would be appropriate for him, he would need to undertake some programmes, that are referred to in the report, in custody.
	
	
	With regard to the material that was available in respect of the matters that were the subject of appeal I have read the facts in relation to those matters, although I dismissed the appeals because there was no point now in pursuing the appeals against the sentences in the Local Court, the prisoner having served those sentences.
	
	
	The prisoner did not give evidence before me in these proceedings. What was not made available to me in relation to the prisoner’s background was his traffic record until recently. I have referred to his previous convictions for what are regarded under the legislation as serious offences. However it is to be pointed out that particularly since 2011 the prisoner has a large number of infringement notices issued for a range of offences, including driving a motor vehicle with his number plate either obscured, or containing misleading information, driving a motor vehicle while using a mobile phone, disobeying a left turn, or right turn signal, exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 kilometres in January 2013, exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 kilometres per hour, but less than 20 kilometres per hour in February 2013, exceeding the speed limit about 14 days later by no more than 10 kilometres per hour, and disobeying traffic lights in July 2014.
	
	
	From what I can see of the traffic history the offender has been sent warning letters in relation to demerit points acquired on at least five separate occasions. I note in relation to the current matters that his licence was suspended by police on his arrest and, as I have indicated, that means that I should backdate any disqualifications to the date that that suspension was ordered by the police.
	
	
	His counsel in his case produced some photographs, and also a medical discharge summary, relating to the victim which I have taken into account. In relation to the submissions of his counsel, his counsel in the written submissions provided to the Court noted, amongst other things, the prisoner’s age at the time of offending, being 33 years and six months, and his current age at about thirty-four and a half years, the maximum penalties and the fact that the plea of guilty was one entered at the Local Court. I propose to give the prisoner a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentences for the two offences requiring the imposition of penalties to reflect the utilitarian benefit of those pleas of guilty.
	
	
	In relation to the injuries suffered by the victim it was submitted that, in effect, the injuries are not in the worst category of injury contemplated by the legislation, and that I accept. It was submitted there was no permanent disability. I cannot conclude beyond reasonable doubt that there is a permanent disability but it is clear from the victim impact statement that the victim still continues to suffer some disability some time after the events.
	
	
	Some comments were made about the number of people that may have been present at the time, but that aspect of the submissions was met by what was in the agreed facts. One would expect in this area of Sydney quite a number of people and vehicles about. That is clear as the agreed facts state.
	
	
	With regard to the driving, it was submitted it was not premeditated or planned driving, and I accept that that is so. But it usually is not the case that crimes of this type are committed by pre meditated or planned actions. If they are, particularly where grievous bodily harm or death occurs, one might have thought, well serious charges would be brought.
	
	
	With regard to the driving it was submitted that the relevant driving at the crux of the drive manner dangerous charge was not over a great distance and as for speed, whilst the car did accelerate harshly, as the facts says, there is no specific speed identified.
	
	
	With regard to considering aggravating factors, under s 21A(2), it was submitted that the prisoner does not have a criminal history that constitutes what relevantly would be an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(d) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which I will hereinafter refer to as, “the Act”. With that submission I agree, but he certainly does not have a record which entitles him to any leniency and his record is a matter of some concern, in the context of his prospects of rehabilitation, given the fact that it reflects a scope of offending across a range of offences, both of violence and dishonesty and disregard for road laws, with varying penalties being imposed. But apparently with no influence upon the prisoner’s conduct as the events of this day demonstrated.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of his counsel, that his offending included the aggravating factor of  “committed without regard for public safety”. Well of course, his conduct did show a lack of regard for public safety.   But in my view, that constitutes an element of the offence in the context of the allegation of driving in a manner dangerous. It is conceded that his offences, with which I am concerned, were a breach of conditional liberty. It is apparent that he was on bail in relation to a number offences that were dealt with, as I pointed out earlier, in September 2015, at the Local Court.
	
	
	The character of the driving of the prisoner, brings into sharp focus the guideline judgment of R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343. There the Court of Criminal Appeal reviewed the guideline that had been laid down in the earlier decision of the Court of R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209. The matter that ultimately required review of the previous guideline, was the reference in the previous judgment to the ‘abandonment of responsibility’ and related comments subsequently by the Court in that matter. It was noted for the purposes of the guideline, concerning an offence contrary to s 52A of the character that the prisoner has pleaded guilty to here, usually was concerned with a young offender of good character with limited or not prior convictions with a victim who was a stranger, and with limited injury to the driver or the driver’s intimates, and a showing of genuine remorse but a plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value.
	
	
	With regard to the amended guideline, the Court pointed out in the decision of Whyte, as it had in Jurisic, that the consideration of the guideline involved a consideration of what was thought to be a 'typical' case, where there was not to be taken into account to a material degree aggravating factors relating to the conduct of the offender. The aggravating factors might include the extent and nature of the injuries inflicted, the number of people at risk, the degree of speed, the degree of intoxication or of substance abuse, erratic driving, competitive driving or showing off, length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk, and ignoring of warnings, or escaping of police pursuit, and other aggravations identified in Whyte, included failing to stop.
	
	
	In this particular matter of course, the failure to stop by the prisoner is charged as a discrete offence and thus is irrelevant to the assessment of the guideline but here by reference to aggravating factors that rise. We have clearly on the facts a number of people at risk. We have both the manner of driving of itself dangerous while the accused was, on his own admission, affected by cannabis, and we have intimately bound up in the character of the driving at the time of the impact and immediately afterwards, quite erratic driving.
	
	
	The length of journey during which others were exposed to risk was relatively short by comparison one might make, for example, to cases in rural or regional areas. But the prisoner drove over at least a couple of kilometres, one would have thought having regard to the geography, in an area that is very highly populated at a very busy time of the day.
	
	
	Ultimately, in relation to the matter, the Court in Whyte determined that for a typical case where the offender’s moral culpability is high, a fulltime custodial sentence of less than three years in the case of death and two years in the case of grievous bodily harm, would not generally be appropriate. However, in the case of the aggravated version of each offence, an appropriate increment to reflect either the higher maximum penalty, or alternatively, the existence of aggravating factors, would need to be considered, and of course, here were have in sentencing, a consideration taken of aggravating factors arising, under s 21A(2) of the Act.
	
	
	The prisoner’s counsel referred to his history of gainful employment. The background of the prisoner set out in the PSR I am prepared to accept from the history obtained by the Community Corrections Service. The prisoner has not had an ideal upbringing and his family was subjected to threats of violence from his father and his father’s abusive behaviour impacted upon the family is a matter of regret and certainly a matter that has some relevance to explaining the prisoner’s development.
	
	
	But on the other hand the prisoner now comes forward in his mid-30s, not as a young man, and of course he comes forward with a history of offending of various types without, seemingly, any impact upon of previous supervision by Community Corrections. It must be fairly said that he comes for sentence in this matter charged with the most serious offences that he has had to face. I accept that he has indicated a willingness to undertake some program of rehabilitation. But clearly there is much work for him to do as otherwise he would not be in a situation he currently is at the present time.
	
	
	With regard to the submissions of his counsel, there was a suggestion put that the prisoner might be regarded as contrite. In my view that could not be found in his favour. The facts of themselves speak of an unwillingness of the prisoner, even after he had sobered up, to be of any assistance to the investigating police. I appreciate that there may have been a question mark about the identification of the prisoner as the driver of the relevant motor vehicle or that his vehicle was the vehicle that came into collision with the victim. I point out again that the collision with the victim was not a deliberate act on the prisoner’s part, as such. But it was a direct consequence of the fact that he was in no state to drive a motor vehicle and he was, whilst he was behind the wheel of the car on this afternoon a danger to anybody else on the road nearby to him and it is a matter of good fortune that other people were not seriously injured or even killed in the course of his driving of the motor vehicle.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the victim was a vulnerable victim. I cannot accept that submission. I understand the point the Crown made about the fact the victim was on a motorbike and was thus was “quite vulnerable” to injury if he came into collision with a car being driven in a manner dangerous to the public. But it is quite clear when one has regard to s 21A(2) that when the legislation in subparagraph (l) talks of vulnerability it is talking about a characteristic of the victim that must have been known to the offender at the time of the commission of the offence and thus was in some way a contributing factor to the choice of the victim or the commission of a particular offence charged. The subparagraph talks about a vulnerable victim, for example, “because the victim was very young or very old or had a disability, or because of the victim’s occupation”, giving some examples such as a taxi driver, a bank teller or a service station attendant. It is self-evident to my mind that what the subsection is talking about is a vulnerability known to the person who commits the offence and provides a motive for the person to commit the particular offence with which that person is charged. That does not arise in this matter. It is either apparent, or self-evident, or clearly able to be found, that the prisoner, by his conduct of the motor vehicle, was oblivious to the motorcyclist, which does characterise the danger the prisoner’s driving created for the public at large.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors arising under s 21A(3) I am prepared to accept that the offence was not part of planned or organised criminal activity. I could not obviously find the prisoner was a person of good character or is unlikely to reoffend or even has good prospects of rehabilitation. They are not even submitted as mitigating factors by his counsel. But the plea of guilty is a mitigating factor. I bear in mind of course the uncertainty as to the identification of the prisoner’s motor vehicle, but then again the intercepted telephone call between the prisoner and the prisoner’s mother reflected clear admissions by him of his offending.
	
	
	I have determined that there are ‘special circumstances’, pursuant to s 44 of the Act. In my view the Community Corrections Service speaks to issues that need to be addressed over an extended period of time and the prisoner, who will be facing his most substantial sentence, will need professional assistance to adjust to community living. I bear in mind also that I have adjusted the non-parole period to reflect the two portions of partial accumulation. The first sentence I impose is a sentence of 18 months which will be partially accumulative upon the sentences imposed in the Local Court, and the second sentence I impose of 3 years imprisonment will be partially accumulative upon that 18 months sentence.
	
	
	In assessing the appropriate sentence, however, for the principal offence, that is the most serious offence, the drive in a manner dangerous causing grievous bodily harm by impact, it is to be borne in mind that I am required to take into account the seven matters on the Form 1. Some of those offences would, if dealt with separately in the Local Court, attract terms of imprisonment.
	
	
	In the guideline judgment in relation to Form 1 matters, Attorney General’s Application No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 147, it was held by the Court of Criminal Appeal that the fact that there matters to be taken into account on a Form 1 means that greater weight should be given to the need for personal deterrence and the community’s entitlement to extract retribution. The Court held that the “entire point of the process” is to impose a longer sentence or to alter the nature of the sentence that would have been imposed for the principal offence if it had stood alone. It was wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small, sometimes it will be substantial. But the sentencing process is only concerned with the principal offence, not to determine appropriate sentences for matters listed on a Form 1 or to determine an overall sentence that would be appropriate for all the offences and apply a discount, giving weight to the matters referred to above. The Court said that deterrence and retribution were entitled to be given greater weight than they otherwise might be given when sentencing for the primary offences.
	
	
	However, there is a limit to what the court can do in relation to this matter, such as, for example, the maximum penalty for the principal offence and of course the principle of 'totality'. It should be understood that the principal offence, if being sentenced alone without the matters on the Form 1, would have attracted a sentence lower than the sentence I ultimately concluded is appropriate. The court held that it would be rarely appropriate for a sentencing judge to attempt to quantify the effect on the sentence for the principal offence from taking into account Form 1 matters, and I do not propose to do so. The matters on a Form 1 will have a significantly lower salience in the sentence process, for various reasons, but a judge must be careful to assess whether it is appropriate to proceed to sentence on the basis that there may be cases where the administration of justice could be brought into disrepute by a person being sentence for criminal conduct on a “manifestly inadequate, unduly narrow or artificial basis”.
	
	
	Concluding the appropriate sentences to be imposed, as I said I have had regard to all the submissions that were put. As I understood it, it was conceded that the totality principle in relation to the two matters requiring the fixing of sentences would require some partial accumulation. The sentence to be imposed for the offence of failing to stop and assist after causing grievous bodily harm will be substantially less than the sentence for the principal offence, and the extent of partial accumulation will be, as I have indicated, for a period of six months. I do not propose to fix a non-parole period for the failing to stop offence because the balance of that sentence will be subsumed into the non-parole period for the driving in a manner dangerous cause grievous bodily harm offence.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of failing to stop and render assistance, which is sequence 8 - this is a technical term for the benefit of the JusticeLink system - you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of 18 months imprisonment. That will date from 12 May 2015 and expire on 11 November 2016. In relation to that offence you are disqualified from holding a motor vehicle driver’s licence for a period of two years from 12 January 2014.
	
	
	In relation to sequence 6, that is the offence of driving in a manner dangerous by impact causing grievous bodily harm, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of one year and four months. That will date from 12 November 2015 and on my calculation will expire on 11 March 2017. The balance of sentence I calculate to be one year and eight months. That will expire on 11 November 2018. In respect of that offence you are disqualified from holding a motor vehicle driver’s licence for a period of four years from 12 January 2014. The total sentence as I have calculated is three years and six months with a non-parole period of one year and ten months, but the non parole period has been adjusted down by two months to reflect the fact that the sentences I impose are partially accumulative upon the sentences that were imposed in the Local Court in September. Now you received a sentence of seven months in September. I have started the sentences I imposed four months into those sentences, so that partial accumulation is another matter I have had to take into account in fixing the non-parole period.
	
	
	Mr Crown?
	
	
	AMARANATH: Your Honour, there’s a backup charge of negligent driving causing grievous bodily harm, I make an application to withdraw that charge.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Withdrawn and dismissed, Mr Crown. Is it on a s 166 certificate?
	
	
	AMARANATH: That is correct.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Have I got the certificate or not?
	
	
	AMARANATH: Yes, it has been sent to the Court papers.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes, but it wasn’t tendered by you last--
	
	
	AMARANATH: No, it wasn’t tendered.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: It has to be tendered. The fact that it sits on the file means nothing unless it’s brought to the attention of the Court, but we will find the certificate. Do you know what sequence number it is?
	
	
	AMARANATH: Yes, it’s sequence 9, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Sequence 9 right.
	
	
	The sentences I have imposed are in relation to sequences 6 and 8. In relation to sequence 9 the charge is withdrawn and dismissed.
	
	
	Is that right?
	
	
	AMARANATH: Thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Anything else?
	
	
	AMARANATH: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Anything else from you Mr Williams?
	
	
	WILLIAMS: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Beard, one thing you should understand, your release to parole will be a matter for the Parole Authority. The sentence I have imposed does not permit me to direct that you be released to parole. So when you get close to the end of your non-parole period it will be a matter for the Parole Authority as to whether you are released on the release date. You will no doubt have discussions with the Community Corrections Services before you are released.
	
	
	OFFENDER: It’s not guaranteed.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I beg your pardon?
	
	
	OFFENDER: It’s not going to be guaranteed?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: It’s not guaranteed because it’s a matter for the Parole Authority. I don’t decide who is released to parole, that’s not my task, I just fix the sentence and then the Parole Authority makes its decision.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you Mr Williams. Thank you Mr Crown.
	
	
	AMARANATH: Your Honour, just one matter. I attempted to take down the sentence as it was read out, but I wasn’t altogether sure whether I had taken it down correctly.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Well in a moment I will sign the orders. If they’re correct I will ask my Associate to print out a copy for you. How is that?
	
	
	AMARANATH: Thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: And give Mr Williams a copy too?
	
	
	WILLIAMS: Thank you, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I will just double check the orders. That looks spot on. I will just have my Associate print them out and you will have them all typed up. The matters on the Form 1 have been taken into account in relation to the principal offence, which is the drive in a manner dangerous cause grievous bodily harm offence, which is obviously the most serious offence. So you have it Mr Crown and you have it Mr Wiliams, the detail of which will be entered up in JusticeLink.

		14 July 2016",2015-12-13 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768485,AB v Regina [2015] NSWCCA 315,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: The appellant, who has been described in the submissions and in the Court below under the pseudonym AB (the appellant), was charged on indictment with six counts of drug and sexual offences against a person, GM (the complainant). The charges were as follows (substituting the name of the person against whom the offences were alleged to have been committed, as set out in the indictment, with ‘the complainant’):
	


“Count one: Between 21 May 1984 and 1 September 1984 at Cromer in the State of New South Wales did supply a drug of addiction other than prepared opium or Indian hemp, namely amphetamine, to [the complainant] contrary to s 21 (2A) Poisons Act 1966;

Count two: Between 1 September 1984 and 15 December 1984 at Cromer in the State of New South Wales did cause to be taken by [the complainant] a stupefying drug, namely cannabis, with the intention of enabling himself to commit an indictable offence, namely homosexual intercourse with [the complainant], a male then above the age of 10 years and under the age of 18 years, namely 14 or 15 years of age contrary to s 38 Crimes Act 1900;

Count three: Between 1 September 1984 and 15 December 1984 at Cromer in the State of New South Wales did have homosexual intercourse with [the complainant] who was then above the age of 10 years and under the age of 18 years, namely 14 or 15 years of age contrary to s 78K Crimes Act 1900;

Count four: On 19 October 1985 at Narrabeen in the State of New South Wales did cause to be taken by [the complainant] a stupefying drug, namely heroin, with the intention of enabling himself to commit an indictable offence, namely homosexual intercourse with [the complainant], a male then above the age of 10 years and under the age of 18 years, namely 15 years of age contrary to s 38 Crimes Act 1900;

Count five: On 19 October 1985 at Narrabeen in the State of New South Wales did commit an act of indecency towards [the complainant], a person then under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years of age contrary to s 61E(2) Crimes Act 1900; and

Count six: Between 1 January 1986 and 19 December 1986 at Bilgola in the State of New South Wales did have homosexual intercourse with [the complainant] who was then above the age of 10 years and under the age of 18 years, namely 15 years of age contrary to s 78K Crimes Act 1900.”


	
	Following a trial before Huggett DCJ and a jury, the appellant was found guilty on Counts 2, 3, 5 and 6 and not guilty on Counts 1 and 4.
	
	
	The appellant has appealed on the following grounds:
	


“Ground 1   The verdicts of the jury on counts 2, 3, 5 and 6 are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.

Ground 2   Count six was brought outside the relevant statutory time limit.

Ground 3   Her Honour erred in directing the jury that (in effect) the jury could not act on the absence of police records as showing that an event did not happen.”


	
	As the appeal on Ground 1 does not solely involve a question of law, leave to appeal is required. The Crown has made no submissions in opposition to the grant of leave on this ground and it should be granted.
	
	
	So far as Ground 2 is concerned, the Crown very properly conceded that the limitation period for the bringing of the charge for a contravention of s 78K of the Crimes Act had expired by the time that the charge was brought, and that it was not appropriate for the Court to exercise its power under s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to enter a verdict on an alternate count. In these circumstances, the appeal in relation to Count 6 should be allowed and the conviction on that ground should be quashed.
	
	
	Because the appellant contends that his convictions on Counts 2, 3, 5 and 6 were unreasonable, it is necessary to set out in some detail the evidence as it emerged at the trial.
	


The Crown case


	
	The Crown essentially alleged that the complainant was a student at a northern Sydney high school in the mid-1980s, while the appellant was employed as a teacher at that high school. It was alleged that the appellant socialised with some of the students by way of music rehearsals, surfing, film making and smoking marijuana with them. It was alleged that the appellant gave the complainant marijuana at school on one occasion with intent to have sexual intercourse with him and proceeded to fellate him (Counts 2 and 3) and committed an act of indecency on him in AB’s blue van at Jamieson Park (Count 5). There was also evidence by the complainant of regular sexual behaviour between them that was not the subject of any charges. The Crown also led evidence from other persons at the school at the time in relation to sexual incidents and smoking marijuana.
	


The complainant’s evidence on his relationship with the appellant


	
	The complainant said that he commenced studying at the high school where the appellant was teaching in 1983 in Year 7 and was there until he left in October or November 1986, on completion of Year 10, and went to work in his father’s business. The complainant stated that the appellant was not his classroom teacher but taught art at the school.
	
	
	The complainant said that from what he could remember, he met the appellant in 1984 or late 1983. He said that he was introduced to him by friends at school, including SS, MS and MD. The complainant’s evidence was that at music rehearsals in the school’s drama room after hours or on weekends, the appellant and the boys would drink alcohol and smoke marijuana. The complainant said that he also recalled smoking marijuana in the appellant’s house and his van, which he described as a blue Toyota HiAce van. The complainant gave evidence that he used to go surfing with the appellant at various northern beaches. He said that the appellant took him and other boys surfing from time-to-time in his van and that he and the other boys would smoke marijuana in the van on the way to the beach. The complainant said that he recalled the appellant telling him “Just keep it to yourself, don’t tell people”.
	


The complainant’s evidence on Count 1


	
	The complainant recalled a school talent quest in the middle of 1984 held in the school gymnasium. He said that his friends MS and MD were participants in the talent quest. The complainant stated that before the show started, or during an intermission, the appellant asked him to go with him upstairs to a room off the drama room to have some speed. The complainant described the room as having desks and equipment for speakers and electrical equipment and as having a window that looked over the gymnasium. He said that the appellant had a key to the room.
	
	
	The complainant stated that the appellant lined up speed on the desk and they snorted it. The complainant said that the appellant told him that it was speed. The complainant described the substance as a white powder but said that he had never used such a substance before, although he had smoked marijuana with the appellant on other occasions prior to the talent quest. He said that the substance made him feel agitated, saying that he could not keep still, spoke at 100 miles per hour and when he returned to the gymnasium, he felt “[p]aranoid, hot, weird, very speedy, very fast”.
	
	
	The complainant’s evidence was that he had never snorted speed prior to the day of the talent quest, but was later involved in the use of illicit substances for 23 years, including speed, LSD, cocaine and heroin. On this basis, he said that he had no doubt that he took speed with the appellant on that occasion.
	


The complainant’s evidence on Counts 2 and 3


	
	The complainant gave evidence about an incident that he alleged occurred in the cleaner’s room at the high school in 1984. He described the room as small, but stated that there were desks, chairs and hot water systems in there. He said that towards the end of the year, in the cleaner’s room, the appellant rolled a joint, the appellant and him started smoking it and then the appellant undid the complainant’s pants and started to perform fellatio on him. He said that the joint made him feel relaxed but he froze when the appellant undid his pants. The complainant gave evidence that the cleaner, a Mr Leonard Taylor, walked into the room while the appellant was performing oral sex on him. He said that the cleaner opened the door but did not actually walk in and mumbled something under his breath, turned around and shut the door and walked away. The complainant was asked if he heard what the cleaner mumbled and he answered “Not really, it’s just – it was muttered words of something – something – I didn’t see that or something like that. He turned round and shut the door and walked away”. The complainant said that he had his back to the door, was facing the back wall and the appellant was down on his knees in front of him. He said that he knew who the cleaner was but did not know him personally and he never spoke to him about the incident.
	
	
	The cleaner, Mr Leonard Taylor, was called to give evidence. He said that he no longer worked at the high school but was still employed as a cleaner in an aged care facility. He stated that he recalled the cleaner’s room at the high school and said that it had a desk, a chair and a couple of hot water heaters in it. He denied remembering either the appellant or the complainant or ever seeing an incident as described by the complainant. He denied ever smelling marijuana in the cleaner’s room. He confirmed that he was very familiar with the smell of marijuana, but never smoked it at work.
	


The complainant’s evidence on Counts 4 and 5


	
	These two counts were said to concern an incident which took place at Jamieson Park on 19 October 1985.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that the incident occurred on Friday 18 October 1985, the day of his 15th birthday. Subsequently, the complainant changed that date to 19 October 1985, saying that when he gave his original evidence, he was “very confused, overwhelmed”.
	
	
	The complainant said that on that day, the appellant drove him to Jamieson Park, rolled a joint and said that he was going to put some cocaine in it. He said that after he and the appellant smoked the joint, he felt groggy and sleepy and passed out in the back of the car. He said that he woke up with his jeans and underwear around his knees and the appellant “haunched behind me with his penis erect about to put it in my backside”. He said that he could feel the appellant’s penis on the back of his body. He said that he pulled up his pants, as did the appellant.
	
	
	The complainant said that the police turned up at the appellant’s van and asked if the complainant was okay. He said that he told the police he was and that he was with his uncle.
	
	
	In relation to the joint, the complainant said that he saw the appellant sprinkle white powder on it. His later experience of drugs made him think it was heroin not cocaine.
	
	
	The complainant described the appellant’s penis, from the opportunity he had to see it, as “very large, a weird – it was smaller at the bottom, got bigger as it went up to the top”. He said that he thought it had a foreskin. He said that he had not seen any other male penises at the age of 15 and that he was circumcised. By contrast, the appellant’s first wife said that the appellant was circumcised, but acknowledged that she made that observation as a grown woman, not under the influence of an illicit substance.
	


The complainant’s evidence on Count 6


	
	The complainant gave evidence that when he was 16 years old, he was at the appellant’s house and had a shower after wearing his spring wetsuit. He initially said that the incident occurred around the time he left school, in November or December 1986. However, he subsequently said that he thought that the incident occurred before he left school.
	
	
	The complainant said that he was naked in the shower and the appellant came in and sexually assaulted him, starting to suck his penis. He said that after it had occurred, he and the appellant left the shower and he overheard the appellant and his wife arguing. He said that the appellant then drove him home. He said that his parents were unaware that he had been with the appellant when he went surfing on the day of the shower incident and that his parents never gave the appellant permission to take him places.
	


Uncharged acts


	
	The complainant gave evidence of the ongoing sexual contact between himself and the appellant. He said that sexual activity occurred once or twice per week and “too often to recall every moment”. He described an occasion when he attended a party at the appellant’s home and said that students SS, MS and MD were present, as was the comedian, George Smilovici, Judith Lucy, a teacher from school and the appellant’s wife. He said that they drank alcohol and smoked marijuana and the marijuana was provided by the appellant.
	


Cross-examination of the complainant


	
	Cross-examination of the complainant focused on inconsistencies between his evidence in chief, previous statements made by him and evidence given by him at two previous trials relating to the same offences.
	
	
	In relation to the Jamieson Park incident (Counts 4 and 5), the complainant initially denied that he had spoken to anyone about making a mistake in his evidence as to the date that the offence occurred. However, he later conceded that he had spoken to the Crown Prosecutor about his mistake, but nobody else.
	
	
	The complainant was referred to his evidence at the second of the two previous trials, where he had said that he did not know the appellant in 1983 and started to see him at some stage in 1984. He was also shown a copy of his statement of 8 July 2011 and agreed that there was “no mention of pot being smoked when the boys were playing music”, although he had said that the appellant “would also smoke pot with us at school”, referring to himself, SS, MS and MD.
	
	
	The complainant agreed that when he made his statement in July 2011 about being given drugs in the cleaner’s room, he made no mention of alcohol being consumed while the boys were playing music. He also agreed that he made no mention of smoking pot when the boys were playing music in the statement he made to clarify certain matters in October 2011.
	
	
	The complainant agreed that his account of events put the incident in the cleaner’s room after the talent quest, as he had said that it occurred in October or November 1984. He initially stated in cross-examination that the incident was his first sexual contact with the appellant and the commencement of the sexual abuse. However, he subsequently gave evidence of another incident, when the appellant allegedly rubbed his penis whilst they were smoking dope in the appellant’s car, and stated that this occurred before the talent quest. He agreed that he would classify the rubbing of his penis as sexual abuse and clarified that he would say it was indecent assault, not sexual activity.
	
	
	The complainant was then taken to the evidence that he gave at the second trial, where he said that the sexual abuse started in 1984. He disputed that the sexual abuse started shortly before the talent quest and said that it probably began at the start of the year, but could not recall dates and could not recall the first incident, as it was only “the significant ones that stuck in my mind”.
	
	
	The complainant denied that he had changed his evidence about the timing of the first incident of sexual contact because he became aware after the first trial that the appellant was not at the school during a period in 1984. He conceded that he knew that there was a difficulty with his evidence at the first trial, in that he put the first instance of sexual activity in the week prior to the talent quest in 1984. However, he denied that he changed his evidence at the second trial for that reason and maintained that he could not remember the date and should have kept a diary.
	
	
	In further cross-examination on Count 1, the complainant acknowledged that in the second trial, he gave different evidence as to how he exited the gymnasium with the appellant. He agreed that in his July 2011 statement, he gave no details about the location where the incident occurred.
	
	
	The complainant agreed that at the first trial, he referred to the drama room as being on a mezzanine level on the first floor and that he walked there after an invitation, but he could not remember what was said. He agreed that he never referred to upstairs in his July 2011 statement or referred to accessing the AV room through the drama room. He agreed that he was shown photographs of these locations prior to giving evidence at his second trial.
	
	
	The complainant was also cross-examined on differences in the evidence he gave in relation to the incident that occurred in the cleaner’s room, the subject of Counts 2 and 3. He agreed that in his statement of July 2011, he had said that he remembered the cleaner opening the door while the appellant was sucking his penis, looking at them, turning around, mumbling something and then leaving. He agreed that in his evidence in the first trial, he said that the cleaner walked in, looked at them and said “oops”, shut the door and walked away. He agreed that in cross-examination in his first trial, he said that what he said in his statement was meant to convey that the cleaner looked and saw them both. He also agreed that the smell of marijuana would have been strong enough to have been smelt by the cleaner.
	
	
	The complainant acknowledged that in cross-examination in the first trial, he recalled that the cleaner said “Oops, I didn’t see that”. He also acknowledged that he gave evidence in the second trial that he could not remember what the cleaner had said and never spoke to him about it.
	
	
	The complainant agreed that he had made no reference to a desk in the cleaner’s room in his July 2011 statement. He also agreed that in his second trial, he had initially denied being shown a photograph of the cleaner’s room when he made his second statement, but then retracted the denial and agreed that he had in fact signed a photograph of the room. He denied that he had referred to the desk after a conversation with one of the investigating police.
	
	
	In cross-examination on the Jamieson Park incidents, the complainant said that he could not recall where the appellant picked him up. He also agreed that when he made his July 2011 statement, he had said “no part of his penis touched me that I can remember”, but maintained that he now remembered feeling something and would “never forget it”. It was put to the complainant that the appellant never met his mother, never took him surfing, never filmed him surfing and never took him to Jamieson Park the day after his birthday. He maintained that all of these things happened.
	
	
	It was put to the complainant that the appellant never took him to his home at Bilgola in 1986. He maintained that his evidence was correct. However, he agreed that when he gave evidence about the shower incident in the second trial, his evidence was that the appellant did not remove his clothes when he came into the shower. He agreed that in his evidence at that trial, he made no mention of hearing the appellant and his wife arguing following the shower incident.
	
	
	The complainant was cross-examined on his evidence that he had attended a party at the appellant’s Bilgola home. He maintained that that had occurred. He said that he was introduced to Mr Smilovici and thought that Judith Lucy was present, but was not introduced to her. He stated that he had little recollection of how he got to and from the party and said that he was invited verbally.
	
	
	The complainant agreed that he was a heroin addict for 16 years and had used speed, cocaine and LSD. The complainant denied that his drug use was totally independent of anything to do with the appellant.
	


Other evidence

William John Allender


	
	Dr Allender, a toxicologist and forensic scientist, gave evidence on the impact of cannabis upon the human system and classified it as a central nervous system depressant. He said that he could not understand why someone would sprinkle cocaine on a marijuana joint, because the combined effect of the two drugs was some stimulatory and some depressant effects. He said that it was more likely, given the evidence of the complainant that he passed out, that the white powder was heroin. He agreed that morphine could affect memory and impair cognition. He agreed that methamphetamine alters perception and can produce hallucinations and that large amounts of cannabis can have a hallucinogenic affect, as can a very small dosage of LSD.
	


CC


	
	CC was called as tendency witness. He was a student at the school in 1986 and the appellant was his group teacher. He said that during a band tryout on the weekend, the appellant asked him to go to the AV room, which was upstairs and had a view down onto the gymnasium, to assist with trying on costumes. His evidence was that the appellant held a pair of pants against him and asked him to try them on, but he declined. He said that when the appellant held the pants against him, he also wrapped his hands around the back of CC’s waist. He said that the appellant then retrieved a second pair, which were a costume and had green leaves on them and said, “Can you take your pants off and try these on for me, it would be a good help, it would be a great help”. He said that the appellant held them to his waist with his arms around him as before. He said that at some stage the appellant lifted up his t-shirt and felt around his appendix scar and asked to see the scar and whether they had shaved him in hospital. He said that the appellant then leaned forward, opened up his pants and moved his pants out. He said that the appellant looked to his genital area, which was exposed, and said “just like a shorn sheep”, because his pubic hair had started to grow back. There was medical evidence to indicate that CC had an appendix operation on 4 May 1986.
	
	
	In cross-examination, CC agreed that he contacted the DPP after seeing a story on the Sydney Morning Herald website about the appellant. He agreed that he had recently become a practising doctor and that he had told nobody about the allegations between 1986 and 2013.
	
	
	CC agreed that he had been trained in relation to inappropriate sexual contact in his medical training and that one of the aspects of the training was to have an independent witness present to assist in case of future allegations. It was put to him that he never attended a band trial on the weekend when the appellant was present, the appellant never accompanied him to the AV room, the appellant never asked him to try on costumes and never touched his penis on the inside or outside of his speedos. CC disagreed.
	


IK


	
	Another student, IK, also gave tendency evidence. He said that he did not know and had not discussed his evidence with the complainant. He said that while working as a panel beater, he was made aware of allegations about an art teacher at his former school. He said that he decided to make a statement to the police and during the statement, disclosed an incident of sexual assault against him.
	
	
	IK said he started Year 7 in 1985 and got to know the appellant through other students who surfed. He said that the appellant was around quite a bit and shot some video footage of them surfing. He said that he recalled going with the appellant to a room above the gym which had a window looking down on the gym. He said that he and the appellant smoked marijuana there, probably weekly. He said that the appellant drove him in his blue van to local beaches and to his house at Bilgola Beach. He said that other students also went to the appellant’s house and smoked marijuana and went surfing.
	
	
	IK said that on one occasion, which he recalled was in winter because he was wearing a full length wetsuit, the appellant was on the beach watching him, SS and another boy, BC, surf and then they went back to the Bilgola house for a shower. He said he was naked in the shower and the appellant came in naked with an erection and reached down and grabbed hold of his penis. He said it did not last for long.
	
	
	In cross-examination, IK said that he went to the appellant’s house less than 10 times. It was put to him that the incidents which he said occurred did not in fact occur and he disagreed.
	


MD


	
	Another student, MD, also gave evidence. He said that he was a friend of the complainant and they grew up together. He said that he played the drums in the music room at school. He said that the appellant would open the music room with a key and he recalled seeing the complainant at the music sessions. He said that as well as playing music, they would muck around and get stoned.
	
	
	MD said that he had seen the complainant at the appellant’s home a couple of times and had been inside the appellant’s home.
	
	
	In cross-examination, MD agreed that he had previously given evidence that students did not smoke pot in the music room, but said that they did it in the stairwell. He said that the appellant never took him surfing and did not provide the marijuana, they had their own. He acknowledged that in his police statement, he did not say that the complainant was at the appellant’s home in Bilgola as he was never asked, but stated that he recalled the complainant being there.
	


Michael Stanton


	
	Mr Stanton was a teacher at the school for nearly 33 years. He said that he recalled the complainant from teaching him in the younger years, namely, Year 7. He explained that the classrooms, staffrooms and other utility rooms were secured with locks and required a key to access. He said that staff were issued with a small set of keys and could obtain spare keys from a cabinet in the administration block.
	


NOR


	
	NOR attended the high school in 1984. He said he got on really well with the appellant. He said he went to the appellant’s Bilgola home once after participating in a surf film activity. He said he appeared in a film clip for Mr Smilovici, filmed by the appellant.
	
	
	NOR gave evidence that he recalled that people in his group would smoke marijuana in front of the appellant, but he could not remember if the appellant supplied marijuana to him. He said that he saw the appellant smoke marijuana in front of him.
	


Deirdre Francis Wauchop


	
	Ms Wauchop was an art teacher at the school and was involved in organising the talent quest in 1984. She gave evidence that the talent quest was held in the gym and explained that there was a room upstairs from which the lighting grid could be accessed.
	
	
	Ms Wauchop stated that she often observed the complainant coming to the staff room when the appellant was there.
	
	
	Ms Wauchop said that at no time did the complainant smoke marijuana in front of her and she would not have tolerated it. She said that she did not recall going to a party at the Bilgola house.
	


Leonard John Taylor


	
	I have already referred to the evidence of the cleaner, Mr Taylor. Mr Taylor said that he did not remember the appellant being a teacher at the school and did not recall the complainant, NOR or MD. He said that he did not recall ever seeing a school boy in the cleaner’s room who should not have been there and definitely did not see anybody having sexual relations in the room or a boy sitting on a desk in the room. He denied coming in to the room, seeing a boy and mumbling something like “oops I didn’t see that”. He said that he definitely did not smell marijuana in the room at lunch time in 1984.
	
	
	The Crown was given limited leave to cross-examine Mr Taylor pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). Mr Taylor agreed that he was very familiar with the smell of marijuana. He said that he would probably have recalled a student being in the room and it would have been a matter of concern if the student was there with a teacher.
	


Sergeant Ferns


	
	Sergeant Ferns, the officer in charge of the investigation, agreed that he obtained a statement from Judith Lucy that she did not know the appellant and had never been to the appellant’s house or to Bilgola. He also obtained information from Mr Smilovici that he went to the appellant’s house once to film a film clip but never attended a party there and did not recall any children being at the house.
	
	
	Sergeant Ferns also gave evidence of his attempt to find any record of the police questioning the appellant at Jamieson Park on 19 October 1985. His evidence was that he attempted to find a written record or computerised entry of police officers speaking to the complainant on that day, but was unable to find any evidence of such a record or entry.
	


The appellant’s case


	
	The appellant gave evidence.
	
	
	The appellant confirmed that he was on leave from the school from 21 May to 9 September 1984 and returned to the school only once during that period to judge a talent quest. He said that at the date of the talent quest, he had never been in the AV room. He denied that on the day of the talent quest he took the complainant to the AV room and provided him with a line of speed and that they both snorted speed.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence that neither Mr Smilovici, Judith Lucy nor the complainant ever came to a party at his house and denied that the complainant ever came to his house and smoked marijuana. He said that he did not recall the complainant.
	
	
	The appellant denied ever going to the cleaner’s room at the high school, denied taking the complainant there and providing him with marijuana or sexually assaulting him. He said that he had keys to other rooms at the high school, mainly the art staff room, but did not have keys to other people’s rooms, as they were usually opened up.
	
	
	The appellant said that he did drive students in his blue van for the school surfing video activity in 1985 and during band rehearsals in 1986. However, he denied taking students surfing or filming them surfing at any other time. He denied that there was anyone smoking dope in the school rooms and did not see anyone smoking dope outside. He denied ever taking the complainant to his house. He said that he was circumcised.
	
	
	The appellant denied all of the allegations made by CC and denied ever going to a room above the gymnasium with IK and providing him with marijuana. He denied taking IK surfing or filming him. He denied that IK ever came to his Bilgola home, denied sexually assaulting him and denied that IK was ever in his van.
	
	
	In cross-examination, it was suggested to the appellant that he must have known CC because he must have seen him 800 times as his rollcall teacher. He denied that he was attracted to high school boys in an inappropriate sexual way.
	
	
	In cross-examination, the appellant repeated his denial about providing the complainant with marijuana and denied observing boys smoking marijuana in the stairwell outside the music room or sharing marijuana with MS.
	
	
	The appellant also denied knowing the whereabouts of the cleaner’s room and it was put to him that he was lying on this issue. He denied taking the complainant to Jamieson Park on any occasion and denied the allegation of sexual abuse in the shower at Bilgola.
	


Ground 1

The parties’ submissions


	
	The appellant submitted there were three matters common to each count. First, the sole witness to give evidence of the allegations was the complainant. Second, there was considerable delay in making the complaint, ranging between 27 years in respect of Count 1, to 25 years in respect of Count 6. Third, the appellant denied each incident.
	
	
	In relation to Counts 2 and 3, the appellant emphasised that the only evidence of the allegations came from the complainant and that his evidence was denied by the appellant. He pointed to the fact that central parts of the evidence were denied by the cleaner, Mr Taylor. In these circumstances it was submitted that the jury should have reasonable doubts on this count.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that, bearing in mind the evidence of the cleaner, the evidence of the appellant and the fact that the jury did not accept the allegation of supply of drugs, it was not open to the jury to reject the evidence of the appellant and accept that of the complainant. In that context, senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the verdict the subject of Count 1 was in respect of an incident which took place at the same time as that the subject of Counts 2 and 3. However, the appellant accepted that there was, on the evidence of the complainant, a separate incident.
	
	
	In relation to Counts 4 and 5, the appellant submitted that an important aspect of the complainant’s account was that the police attended the scene and had taken the complainant’s details. The appellant submitted that the fact that the Crown was unable to call a police officer to corroborate the account, or produce a document to indicate that the police had spoken to the complainant, should have raised a reasonable doubt in the mind of the jury. Likewise, in regard to Count 6, the appellant pointed out that this count depended on the uncorroborated word of the complainant.
	
	
	The appellant also submitted that as all verdicts depended on the uncorroborated word of the complainant, the not guilty verdicts on Counts 1 and 4 were inconsistent with the verdicts of guilty on the other counts.
	
	
	The Crown described the cross-examination of the complainant as focusing on some minor inconsistencies between his evidence at the trial and the earlier aborted trials. The Crown emphasised that the jury had the tendency evidence of CC and IK. It was submitted that if this evidence was accepted beyond reasonable doubt, it demonstrated the appellant’s tendency to be sexually attracted to young male students and to act upon that tendency. The Crown pointed to the fact that the method of sexual assault described by CC and IK bore similarities to the complainant’s allegations, namely, taking them to a small room which he had a key to access and, in the case of CC, sexually assaulting him and, in the case of IK, supplying him with drugs.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that the evidence of IK and the other students demonstrated that the appellant watched students surfing, had them in his Bilgola house, allowed them to shower there and that he provided marijuana to them and smoked it with them.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to a number of matters which were said to support the complainant’s account. They included Mr Stanton’s evidence of the ease of accessing spare keys; Ms Wauchop’s evidence that the complainant was often in the staff room with the appellant; and the use of the appellant’s van to transport students to various destinations.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Taylor, the cleaner, the Crown submitted that it was open to the jury to find him unconvincing and to find that his memory was affected by the long delay between the events in question and the date of the trial. In that context, senior counsel for the Crown submitted that Mr Taylor’s evidence had to be considered in the context that he could not remember either the complainant or the appellant, who had been a teacher at the school for some years. She pointed out that he was first spoken to about the incident 27 years after it occurred. She submitted that Mr Taylor had some self-interest, in that if the incident occurred, he should have reported it. She pointed out that the jury saw him give his evidence, had an opportunity to see how he answered questions and observed his demeanour in the witness box. She submitted that they were entitled to accept or reject his evidence. She also pointed out that the jury were taken through his evidence by the trial judge, so were left in no doubt as to the contradictory evidence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was open to the jury to reject the appellant’s evidence, particularly having regard to what were described as “the absurdities and implausibility of his list of denials”.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the verdicts of not guilty on Counts 1 and 4 were not inconsistent with the verdicts of guilty arrived at on the other counts. The inconsistency of the evidence on Count 1 was pointed to as a matter that had to be taken into consideration in the circumstances of that count. In particular, the Crown pointed to the inconsistency between the complainant’s account of which door the appellant used to exit the gymnasium, the room in which the incident occurred and the additional details supplied about the room after the complainant viewed photographs of it.
	
	
	In respect of Count 4, the Crown pointed to the fact that the complainant’s evidence was that the appellant sprinkled white powder on the joint and told him it was cocaine but, as a result of his experience in later life, he came to believe it was heroin. As a result, the charge which originally identified the drug as heroin or cocaine, was amended to refer only to heroin. The Crown pointed out that for the jury to convict on these counts, it would have to accept the appellant’s statement to the complainant that it was “speed in Count 1” but not to accept that it was cocaine in Count 4. The Crown also pointed to the evidence of Dr Allender, who stated that if the incident had occurred as described, he would have expected considerably worse or longer effects on a person the age of the complainant.
	
	
	The Crown also pointed to the fact that the jury were properly directed to consider each charge separately and to only consider evidence concerning the particular offence. It was pointed out that they were directed on two occasions that if they had a concern about the credibility or reliability on one count, it was essential that they give consideration and weight to this when considering the other counts. The Crown also referred to the direction that the jury were to approach the complainant’s evidence with caution, given that he was essential to the proof of the Crown’s case.
	
	
	In that context, the Crown submitted that the different verdicts were consistent with compliance with these directions.
	


Consideration


	
	The principles on which a court will set aside a verdict as unreasonable are well established. In SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11]-[14], the Court stated that the approach to be adopted was that laid down in M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 492-494, namely, that the Court is required to make its own “independent assessment of the evidence”. If, after taking into account the primary responsibility of the jury in determining the question of guilt or innocence, and the benefit of the jury having seen and heard the evidence, the Court is left in doubt as to the reasonableness of the verdict, the verdict should be set aside. In M, the Court also stated (at 494) that “[i]n most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced” and “[i]t is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt … that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred”: see also MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [59].
	
	
	As was pointed out by Hayne J in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113] (Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreeing), for a verdict to be unreasonable, it is not enough that a review of the evidence shows only that it was possible for a jury to reach a different conclusion. However, for a court to conclude that there was no miscarriage, it is not sufficient that there was evidence on which a jury could convict. If, after giving full weight to the primacy of the jury, the court is left in reasonable doubt as to the verdict, it is only where the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving the doubt, that the court can conclude that there was no miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	In a case such as the present, where the ultimate conclusion depends to a significant extent on the assessment of conflicting evidence of events which occurred many years ago, the primacy of the jury as the trier of fact and the advantage of the jury in seeing or hearing the evidence must be kept steadily in mind. As was stated by McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ in MFA at [59], the function to be performed by the appellate court is to be “performed within a legal system that accords special respect and legitimacy to jury verdicts deciding contested factual questions concerning the guilt of the accused in serious criminal trials”. This is particularly so in a case such as the present.
	
	
	It is convenient to first turn to the submissions on what was described as inconsistent verdicts. In the present case, there was no legal or technical inconsistency in the verdicts in the sense described in MacKenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; 190 CLR 348 at 366. As was pointed out by Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ in that case at 366, where the inconsistency arises in jury verdicts on different counts in a criminal trial, “the test is one of logic and reasonableness”. Their Honours described the approach of the Court in such circumstances in the following terms (at 367):
	


Nevertheless, the respect for the function which the law assigns to juries (and the general satisfaction with their performance) have led courts to express repeatedly, in the context both of criminal and civil trials, reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent in the relevant sense. Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury. In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge's instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.”

	In R v TK [2009] NSWCCA 151; 74 NSWLR 299, Simpson J (as her Honour then was), with whom Latham J agreed, stated at [128] that the focus of the inquiry, in considering the issue, is upon any explanation for the acquittals. Her Honour suggested, at [135], that the question is whether the verdict was open on the whole of the evidence, having regard (relevantly) to the fact of the jury’s acquittal on one or some counts and whatever can be discerned as an explanation for that acquittal.
	
	
	In that context, however, it is important to bear in mind that in the present case, the jury were directed to consider each charge separately and that if they had concerns about the credibility or reliability on one count, it was essential that they give consideration to this when considering the other counts. There is no reason to assume that the jury did not comply with that direction: Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 at 420. The fact that they may not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence of the complainant on a particular count established guilt on that count, does not mean that they could not be so satisfied of his evidence on other counts in the indictment.
	
	
	In the present case, there is at least one significant distinguishing factor in Counts 1 and 4, namely, that they involved a drug other than cannabis. Whilst there was a significant body of evidence that the appellant either supplied cannabis to students, was with them when they smoked it, or smoked it with them, there was no such evidence in relation to the drugs the subject of Counts 1 and 4. In relation to Count 1, the jury was entitled to have reasonable doubt that speed was given to the complainant, particularly having regard to his evidence that he only had no doubt the substance was speed based on his subsequent experience with illicit drugs, a somewhat unsatisfactory way of identifying a particular substance. The jury were entitled to take this into account, along with the other difficulties with his evidence on that count to which the Crown referred (see par [80] above), in deciding to acquit on that charge.
	
	
	In acquitting the appellant on Count 4, while entering a verdict of guilty on Count 5, the jury evidently was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant administered heroin to the complainant. I have referred to the fact that the charge was amended to delete the reference to cocaine, notwithstanding the complainant’s evidence that he was told by the appellant that the powder sprinkled on the joint was cocaine. This, coupled with the evidence of Dr Allender, to which I have referred to in par [81] above, could have been sufficient to raise reasonable doubt as to this count in the minds of the jury, without necessarily affecting their conclusion on the other counts.
	
	
	There are number of inconsistencies between the evidence given by the complainant at the trial, the evidence given by him in two previous trials and in his statement of July 2011. I have set them out in pars [25]-[39] above and I do not think that they can be described as minor. Equally, most of them were matters of detail and such variations were not surprising having regard to the length of the time between the incident complained of and the trial, the number of trials and the fact that for many years, the complainant was addicted to illicit drugs.
	
	
	Further, the evidence of the complainant that he was at a party at the appellant’s house and he thought Ms Lucy was present, was denied by the appellant. However, there was some evidence that the appellant was acquainted with Mr Smilovici (see the evidence of NOR, referred to in par [52] above) and evidence that students went to the appellant’s Bilgola home (see the evidence of IK and MD, referred to above).
	
	
	Importantly, the jury had the tendency evidence of CC and IK, to which I have referred. That evidence, if accepted beyond reasonable doubt, would establish that the appellant had a tendency to be sexually interested in young males and to act upon that tendency. It was open to the jury to accept the evidence of those two witnesses, notwithstanding the appellant’s denial of their evidence. In particular, the jury was entitled to reject the evidence of the appellant that he never knew CC, particularly having regard to the fact that he was CC’s class teacher.
	
	
	Further, a considerable body of the appellant’s evidence was contradicted by other witnesses. In particular, his denial that he ever smoked marijuana with students was contrary to the evidence of IK, MD and NOR. NOR and IK each said that they had been to the appellant’s home. MD also said that he saw the complainant there. There was also evidence of Ms Wauchop, who stated that she often saw the complainant coming into the staff room when the appellant was there.
	
	
	There are, however, two further pieces of evidence which require consideration. The first is the complainant’s description of the appellant’s penis, to which I have referred in par [20] above. That description was inconsistent with the evidence that the appellant had been circumcised (see par [20]). The second is the evidence of Mr Taylor, relating to Counts 2 and 3.
	
	
	As to the first of those matters, it seems to me that it was open to the jury to conclude that what may have been an inaccurate description of the appellant’s penis did not affect the credibility of his account of the events in question. The complainant was only 15 at the time of the event and stated that he had never seen another male penis before, apart from his own. In these circumstances, it seems to me that it was open to the jury to accept his account of the events alleged in Count 5, even if they did not accept the accuracy of his description of the appellant’s penis.
	
	
	Mr Taylor denied observing the incident the subject of Counts 2 and 3. However, he said that he did not recall either the appellant, the complainant, NOR or MD. His ultimate evidence was that he probably would have recalled the incident had it occurred.
	
	
	This evidence on Counts 2 and 3 was significant. For the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on Counts 2 and 3, they would either have to reject the evidence of Mr Taylor or at least conclude that he did not recall the incident, or accept the evidence of the complainant that the incident occurred, while not necessarily being satisfied that Mr Taylor witnessed it.
	
	
	The assessment of each of the competing pieces of evidence involved an assessment of the credibility and reliability of contested oral evidence concerning events which took place many years before the trial. Such an assessment is quintessentially a matter for the jury. Having regard to the fact that they were properly instructed and the advantage they had in seeing and hearing the witnesses, I am not persuaded that the verdict was unreasonable. Any doubt I may otherwise have had as to the reasonableness of the verdict in this case is overcome by the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the witnesses.
	
	
	I should add that, having regard to the evidence of Sergeant Ferns as to the keeping of police records in 1985, I do not think that the failure to produce police records of the encounter at Jamieson Park meant that it was not open to the jury to conclude that the encounter with the police occurred.
	
	
	It follows that this ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 3


	
	This ground concerns a direction given by the trial judge in relation to the Jamieson Park incident the subject of Count 5.
	
	
	To understand the submissions, it is necessary to set out in little detail the evidence and the directions given by the trial judge to the jury.
	
	
	It was common ground that no report or record of the police speaking to the complainant at Jamieson Park on 19 October 1985 was produced at the trial. In that context, Detective Ferns gave the following evidence:
	


“Q.   Did you make any inquiry from Local Area Police Command in relation to police archives?

A.   Yes.

Q.   How long do they keep records of things like that, a police event, going and speaking to someone?

A.   Notebooks?

Q.   Yes.

A.   Depending on – we’re talking about an era back in the 80s, record keeping wasn’t as good as what it is today. We keep our records now for 20 years. Some stations – Dee Why still had some records down in the basement, but those records I was after weren’t there, so I went to the archives, the New South Wales Police archives, which is the State archives. Those documents weren’t there. And I also conducted a Nemesis email, which is an email to every single police officer in the State asking for any assistance in the investigation, but I got a negative result.

Q.   Just in relation to the notebooks, as you understand it you’re not even sure that a notebook entry was made necessarily. Is that the case?

A.   No, exactly right. I was – no, I don’t know that.

…

Q.   So you weren’t able to locate any police log or information in relation to that particular night?

A.   No, I made extensive inquiries. There’s also message pads, there’s notebooks, duty books, there’s COPS event entry. New South Wales COPS only started in 1994, so prior to that everything was done on duplicate and triplicate. I made extensive inquiries.

Q.   When you talk about COPS, just for the members of the jury –

A.   COPS is computerised operational policing system. It’s our database that we use to look up people and we hold all our information and data on that system. We call it – an acronym for COPS.”


	
	A number of the directions given by the trial judge to the jury are relevant to this issue.
	
	
	Early in her summing-up, in dealing with the evidence generally, her Honour made the following remarks:
	


“You must understand, members of the jury, that the evidence is the only material upon which you can base your conclusion as to whether each particular offence has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. You look at what is before you, not what is not before you. You do not speculate about what might have been the evidence, you look at what is in fact the evidence before you.”


	
	Shortly thereafter, her Honour gave the following direction:
	


“It is the evidence that you must consider. You must not speculate about evidence or material that is not before you, for example, if you were to take the view that there was no evidence on a particular topic that you thought was important or significant, you do not then speculate about what that evidence might have been. If you were to think there is a piece of evidence missing on a particular issue, then you simply take that fact into account when you are asking yourself has the Crown proved the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Do not speculate, you simply take that into account in coming back to answer that ultimate question.”


	
	In that context, her Honour gave a specific direction in relation to the absence of police evidence. It is in regard to this direction that the complaint is made:
	


“Mr Averre submitted that the absence of police records would show that in fact records do not exist because it did not happen. It might show that, of course you cannot speculate. Detective Ferns said he made an inquiry and got no result. So you must act on the evidence that is before you not what is not before you. You take what is not before you into account in determining if the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.”


	
	It should be noted that the Crown, in written submissions, submitted that the word “not” in the last sentence of this direction was a typographical error. At the hearing, senior counsel for the appellant accepted that this may be correct.
	


The parties’ submissions


	
	The appellant accepted that the evidence of Detective Ferns was admissible under s 69 of the Evidence Act. He submitted that the presence of records establishing that police spoke to the complainant at Jamieson Park would have been admissible as evidence that such a conversation did take place. He submitted that the absence of such records was equally admissible. In that context, he pointed to s 69(4) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that in those circumstances, the jury should have been directed that the absence of any record of a conversation was evidence that no such conversation took place. He submitted that the penultimate sentence in the last direction given by the trial judge, set out above, would be understood by the jury as a direction that the absence of police records of the incident was not a factor to be taken into account.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the criticism of the last direction given by her Honour did not take into account her earlier directions. It was submitted that the submission of the appellant that the failure to find any records constituted evidence that no such conversation took place was misconceived. The Crown submitted that this submission failed to acknowledge the fact that the alleged conduct concerned events in 1985, the nature of the conversation between the police and the complainant and the state of record keeping at that particular time, as described by Detective Ferns.
	
	
	In addition, the Crown pointed out that no argument concerning s 69 was raised at the trial and no redirection was sought.
	


Consideration


	
	Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) applied and the appellant appeared to accept that it was necessary for him to show that, as a result of the direction complained of, he lost a real chance, or a chance fairly open, of being acquitted of the charge in question: ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266 at [148]; Poniris v R [2014] NSWCCA 100 at [59].
	
	
	I have set out the three relevant directions above. The first direction instructed the jury to act on the evidence without speculating what the evidence might have been. This direction seems to me to be unexceptional.
	
	
	The second direction explained how the jury should respond to the absence of a piece of evidence concerning a particular issue. The trial judge expressly told the jury that such absence could be taken into account when considering whether the Crown had proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The jury, acting on that direction, could take into account the absence of a police report in deciding whether to accept the complainant’s evidence beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The third direction, the one complained of, is somewhat obscure. However, with respect to the parties, I do not think that read in context, the inclusion of “not” in the last sentence is a typographical error. Read in the context of the previous directions, the trial judge was, in my view, directing the jury that they could consider, in determining whether the Jamieson Park incident occurred, that there was no police report. The warning against speculation did not in my view direct the jury to not adopt that course, particularly in light of her Honour’s earlier comments and the final sentence of the direction complained of.
	
	
	The evidence of Sergeant Ferns as to records kept in 1985 disclosed a number of competing possibilities, including that no note was taken of the event or that the records no longer existed. In making the direction referred to, the trial judge was warning the jury that they did not have to speculate as to which inference was correct, but simply take the absence of a note into account in determining whether the Crown had proved its case. In these circumstances, I do not think that the direction lost the complainant a real chance of acquittal and leave to raise this ground should be refused.
	
	
	I do not think that s 69 of the Evidence Act affects the matter. The only relevant evidence was that of Sergeant Ferns. As I have indicated, that left open a number of possibilities. Even if it could be said that the evidence tended to prove that there was no record kept of the occurrence of the event, such that s 69(4) had application, the relevant matter the subject of her Honour’s direction was not whether a record was in fact kept, but rather what the jury could make of the fact that no record was produced. As I indicated, the directions stating that this could be taken into account in determining whether the Crown had proved its case did not deprive the appellant of the chance of an acquittal.
	


Sentence


	
	Having regard to the fact that the conviction on Count 6 needs to be set aside, it will be necessary to resentence the appellant. The parties should be directed to provide submissions on this issue.
	


Conclusion


	
	In the result, I would make the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to the appellant to appeal on Ground 1 of the notice of appeal.
	
	
	Refuse leave to appeal on Ground 3.
	
	
	Conviction in respect of Count 6 of the indictment be quashed and a verdict of acquittal be entered on that count.
	
	
	Appeal against conviction otherwise dismissed.
	
	
	Direct the appellant to make submissions on the appropriate sentence to be imposed within 14 days of 1 February 2016.
	
	
	Direct the Crown to make submissions in reply within the following 14 days.
	



	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with the Chief Justice.
	
	
	RS HULME AJ: I also agree with the Chief Justice.

2768488,Further application of Petronella Boege pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 1925,"determination


	
	Petronella Boege (“the applicant”) has applied for an inquiry into her conviction on 5 January 2000 before the Local Court of New South Wales for an offence of common assault contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The application is brought pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“CAR Act”). The matter has some history.
	


The Procedural History of the Matter


	
	The applicant was charged on 15 October 1999 with common assault, the complainant being her former husband, Wolfgang Boege. The matter came for hearing before Magistrate O’Connor on 5 January 2000 at the Local Court at Bega. Having heard evidence from the complainant and the informant police officer (both called in the prosecution case), and from the applicant in her case as defendant, the learned magistrate found the offence proven. A conviction was recorded and a fine of $500 was imposed.
	
	
	The applicant appealed on all grounds, with her appeal initially coming before Goldring DCJ in the District Court of New South Wales, sitting at Bega. On 4 December 2000 his Honour made, or purported to make, an order pursuant to s 133 of the Justices Act 1902 (NSW), requiring four witnesses to attend at the hearing of the appeal to give evidence or further evidence in person before the District Court. Judge Goldring did not hear the appeal, but marked it as not reached in the circuit sittings of the Court over which his Honour presided. The matter was adjourned for hearing of the appeal to the next sittings of the Court at Bega, in March 2001.
	
	
	His Honour Judge Shillington QC DCJ heard the appeal on 8 March 2001. When the matter came before his Honour, there was no record on the Court’s file of any orders made by the Court for the attendance of witnesses to give evidence in person at the hearing of the applicant’s appeal. His Honour considered an application for the police informant and the complainant to be called, but declined to give a direction for the attendance of the prosecution witnesses. He did make an order for the attendance of two additional witnesses that the applicant wished to call in her case.
	
	
	The hearing proceeded and, at the conclusion of evidence and submissions, Shillington QC DCJ found the offence proved, confirming the finding of guilt, and the conviction and penalty previously imposed by the Local Court.
	
	
	In 2012 the applicant made an application to this Court pursuant to s 78 of the CAR Act, seeking an inquiry into her conviction and sentence (“the first application”). The application was considered by Adamson J but dismissed: Application by Petronella Boege for an inquiry into conviction and sentence pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (Supreme Court (NSW), Adamson J, 27 March 2012, unrep)
	
	
	Following the dismissal of that application the applicant petitioned her Excellency the (then) Governor of New South Wales, asking for a review of the conviction, pursuant to s 76 of the CAR Act. The petition was declined on 30 January 2013.
	
	
	The applicant now makes this second s 78 application, asserting that there is new material which was not available when the first application was determined which justifies both fresh consideration of a s 78 application, and an order directing that an inquiry into the 2000 conviction be conducted.
	
	
	The “new material” is a transcript of the proceedings of 4 December 2000 which provides a record of the s 133 order, or purported order, of Goldring DCJ in which two prosecution witnesses were directed to attend and give evidence at the hearing of the applicant’s appeal to the District Court, together with two additional witnesses to be called by the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant contends that the transcript establishes that Goldring DCJ made an order for the attendance of witnesses and, in disregarding or failing to comply with that order, Shillington QC DCJ fell into jurisdictional error. The applicant submits that this “jurisdictional error” gives rise to the appearance of a doubt or question as to the applicant’s guilt of the offence of common assault.
	


The Evidence before the Local Court


	
	The charge against the applicant arose against a background of a bitterly acrimonious marital separation and divorce. After some years of marriage the complainant and the applicant separated, and the applicant was excluded from the marital home. The complainant remained living in the matrimonial home, which was situated on a rural property.
	
	
	On 15 October 1999 the applicant attended the former matrimonial home to retrieve some property. The common assault offence was alleged to have occurred on that day.
	
	
	The matter was heard on 5 January 2000 at Bega. The applicant was represented by counsel.
	
	
	The transcript of the proceedings of that day have been submitted to the Court as part of the applicant’s s 78 application, and I have read and considered the evidence given before the Local Court.
	
	
	Called by the prosecution were Senior Constable Anthony Van der Hout and Wolfgang Boege. The applicant gave evidence in her case.
	
	
	Senior Constable Van der Hout deposed (by statement and viva voce) that, on 15 October 1999 the applicant attended the Bega Police Station seeking assistance in retrieving some personal possessions from the marital home. The officer, who did not know the applicant or her former husband, having never met either of them previously, agreed to go to the property with the applicant so that she could collect her possessions. The applicant drove to the property in her car with the officer travelling separately in a police vehicle.
	
	
	During the drive to the property the officer and the applicant encountered the complainant, Mr Boege, as he drove along in the opposite direction. He stopped and Senior Constable Van der Hout spoke to him about the applicant collecting some of her property. The applicant, who also spoke briefly to the complainant, drove off towards the property whilst Senior Constable Van der Hout was still speaking with the complainant. The officer followed her soon after, with the complainant also driving to the property.
	
	
	When Senior Constable Van der Hout arrived, he saw the applicant walking away from the house with a number of photograph albums in her arms. The complainant had also arrived at the home, and a dispute between him and the applicant ensued about her attempt to take the photograph albums. Senior Constable Van der Hout told the applicant to give the albums to the complainant. She refused. The complainant stepped towards the applicant and held out his arms for the albums. When he moved to take the albums from her, the applicant swung out at him with her arm.
	
	
	The complainant moved away from the applicant and went towards the house; the applicant was physically restrained by Senior Constable Van der Hout. The complainant called out to the officer to come and see damage done by the applicant to the front door of the premises, and the officer released the applicant and walked towards the house. The applicant followed.
	
	
	On reaching the front of the house the applicant tried to pull the photograph albums away from the complainant, who told her to leave. When she was unable to gain possession of the albums, the applicant struck the complainant in the face a number of times. Senior Constable Van der Hout took the applicant by the arms and took her to her car. He directed her to leave the property, and told her he intended to speak to her formally at the police station.
	
	
	The applicant left the property. After speaking briefly with the complainant, and observing the damage to the front door of the house, which appeared to have been smashed in, the officer returned to the police station. He attended to the documentation necessary to make an application for an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (“ADVO”) against the applicant for the protection of the complainant. When the complainant attended the police station later that day, she was charged.
	
	
	The complainant gave an account of events that was broadly similar to that of Senior Constable Van der Hout, although he recalled that the blows struck by the applicant to his face had been delivered immediately after he took the albums from her, and as they stood in the garden, rather than by the front door. He deposed that the applicant struck him four or five times to the face before Senior Constable Van der Hout restrained her.
	
	
	The complainant said that he then walked towards the house, observing the damaged front door. He called to the officer to come and see the damage. When Senior Constable Van der Hout followed him to the house, the applicant also approached the door. The complainant recalled that the applicant looked like she intended to “have another go”, but the police officer removed her from the property.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence in her case, deposing that, on arrival at the property, she used a wood splitter to smash in the front door to give her access to the premises. She gathered up a number of photograph albums and then returned the wood splitter to the shed where she had gotten it. As she emerged from the shed she said that she was grabbed from behind by the complainant. She asserted that Senior Constable Van der Hout also grabbed her, and told her to give the albums to the complainant. The applicant started to shout abuse at the complainant, who took the albums and ran to the house.
	
	
	The applicant denied having assaulted the complainant, maintaining in her evidence that she had been attacked by both the complainant and the police officer (T43 for example).
	


The Conclusions of the Magistrate


	
	Having heard the evidence from the witnesses, and had the opportunity to observe each as they gave their respective testimony, the learned magistrate accepted the evidence of Senior Constable Van der Hout and the complainant as to the assault upon the complainant by the applicant.
	
	
	The magistrate did not accept the applicant as a truthful witness.
	
	
	At one point during the applicant’s evidence in chief, when she demonstrated the motion by which she asserted the complainant grabbed her, his Worship (as was the form of address then current) asked the applicant a number of questions in an apparent effort to understand her evidence on that point (T37 – T38). Although the applicant’s counsel did not describe the movements that the applicant demonstrated to the court for the record, the nature of the movements are clear from the questions asked of the applicant by the magistrate. The movements as described have an air of unreality about them, and this plainly troubled the learned magistrate.
	
	
	The magistrate was unable to accept what the applicant said about the alleged assault upon her by the complainant. He was conscious of the inconsistencies between the evidence of Senior Constable Van der Hout and the complainant as to the sequence of events and precise location of the assault, but noted that such inconsistencies as existed did not go to the essential elements of the offence before the court for determination.
	
	
	With respect to those essential matters, the learned magistrate regarded the evidence of the two prosecution witnesses as consistent. In particular, the magistrate accepted Senior Constable Van der Hout’s evidence, noting that he was entirely independent of the applicant and the complainant, and that his evidence was consistent with the narrative account he had made immediately after the incident, in support of an ADVO application.
	


The Proceedings before the District Court


	
	Central to the applicant’s fresh s 78 application is the question of purported procedural irregularity in the proceedings before the District Court, leading to what the applicant contends is jurisdictional error in the dismissal of her appeal.
	
	
	There is a real question as to whether there was in fact an irregularity of such a nature as to lead to jurisdictional error.
	
	
	The applicant asserts, and the Crown concedes that, on 4 December 2000 Goldring DCJ pronounced orders pursuant to s 133 of the Justices Act 1902 (NSW) [1]  directing Senior Constable Van der Hout and the complainant to attend for further evidence.
	
	
	At the time of the hearing of the applicant’s appeal to the District Court, appeals against convictions recorded in the Local Court were dealt with as a rehearing on the transcripts: s 132 Justices Act 1902 (NSW). That provision (now repealed) is in the following terms:
	


“132 Appeals against conviction or order to be by way of rehearing on the transcripts of evidence

(1) An appeal against any conviction or order made by a Magistrate is to be by way of rehearing on the transcripts of evidence heard before the Magistrate, except as provided by section 133.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a transcript is taken to be a correct transcript of a true record of evidence if the transcript is certified in the manner prescribed by the regulations.

(3) On such an appeal, new evidence may be given only with the leave of the District Court, if the Court is of the opinion that it is in the interests of justice that the evidence be given.

(4) A clerk of a Local Court must, at the request of an appellant or respondent, provide one copy of the transcript of evidence of any witness free of charge to the appellant or respondent.

(5) A registrar is also required, at the request of an appellant or respondent, to provide one copy of the transcript of evidence of any witness free of charge to the appellant or respondent, if the registrar has been provided with a copy of the transcript by a clerk of the Local Court.

Note. On receiving notice of an appeal the clerk of a Local Court is required to transmit the relevant papers to a registrar for keeping in the records of the District Court (see section 126 (4)).”

Witnesses could only be directed to attend to give evidence in person if one of the matters set out in s 133(1) was satisfied. Section 133 is in the following terms:

“133 Circumstances when evidence to be given in person

(1) The District Court may direct that a person attend to give evidence in person in appeal proceedings referred to in section 132 if:

(a) in the case of a witness in proceedings that relate to an offence involving violence who is the alleged victim of the offence—the Court is of the opinion that there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give evidence, or

(b) in any other case—the Court is of the opinion that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give evidence.

(2) An appellant or a respondent may apply for a direction under this section only if he or she has served on the other party, within such period as the District Court may direct, a notice that the applicant wishes a specified witness to attend at the appeal proceedings.

(3) A direction may be withdrawn only on the application, or with the consent, of the applicant.

(4) If the District Court refuses to give a direction, the Court must give reasons for the refusal.

(5) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the determination of special reasons under subsection (1) (a) and the determination of substantial reasons under subsection (1) (b).

(6) In particular and without otherwise limiting subsection (5), the District Court is, in determining whether special or substantial reasons exist, to have regard to whether or not the appellant was legally represented for the whole or part of the proceedings heard before the Magistrate.”


	
	On 4 December 2000 the applicant’s counsel sought an order pursuant to s 133(1) (although without referring to the legislation) directing the informant and the complainant to attend for further cross-examination. Counsel submitted to his Honour that the applicant had not been able to fully cross-examine the witnesses as to the location of the assault because no photographs of the property had then been available to her. It was submitted that, with the benefit of photographs that would be available for the hearing of the appeal, the applicant should be permitted to further question the witnesses.
	
	
	Counsel also advised his Honour that it was intended to call two witnesses in the defence case to give evidence of injuries that the applicant purportedly had after the incident in October 1999, and an order was sought permitting that evidence to be led. Although the applicant had issued subpoenas upon her three adult children to attend the Local Court to give evidence of that nature, all of her children had refused to give evidence on her behalf, and so the evidence was not called before the Local Court. Counsel relied upon the failure of the witnesses to attend as a basis upon which orders should be made for the attendance of two witnesses at the hearing of the appeal, one being a child of the applicant (Linda Muirden), and one being a neighbour (Elaine Bolton).
	
	
	The Crown did not seek to be heard with respect to the s 133 application, and his Honour made an order for the attendance of both prosecution witnesses, and the two witnesses to be called for the applicant.
	
	
	As it happened, the District Court was not able to hear the matter in the December 2000 sittings, and the appeal was adjourned to the following year.
	
	
	When the matter was next mentioned before the District Court before Shillington QC DCJ, there was a question as to which, if any, witnesses were to be called. The court file contained no record of any order having been made requiring witnesses to attend. The Crown had no record of the order, and counsel for the applicant apparently had no real memory of the order having been made, relying only on his file note of it. Since counsel asserted that the order was for the cross-examination of witnesses he had indicated he proposed to call, and that the order had been made by Shillington QC DCJ, neither of which could have been correct, it appears that his Honour came to doubt that any such order was ever made.
	
	
	The application was made afresh before his Honour and, with respect to the Crown witnesses, declined. His Honour gave a direction for the attendance of Ms Muirden and Ms Bolton.
	


Was There an “Order” that Bound the Court?


	
	The applicant’s contention is that there was a s 133 order made by Goldring DCJ and that, because that order bound the court as constituted by Shillington QC DCJ, his Honour fell into error in proceeding to hear the appeal on the transcript of the prosecution case, as if no order for the attendance of witnesses had been made.
	
	
	The Crown has filed written submissions concerning the second s 78 application pursuant to s 79(4) of the CAR Act, and submits that, because the order was not entered into the record of the court, arguably, it was not perfected, and was without effect (although it could have been reopened and perfected): Court of Appeal Registrar v Craven (No 2) (1995) 120 FLR 464. Notwithstanding that, the Crown very fairly suggests that the application should be determined on the basis that the direction of Goldring DCJ was effective upon being pronounced.
	
	
	The Crown further concedes that, if the order made by Goldring DCJ was in effect and binding, Shillington QC DCJ had no jurisdiction to withdraw it without the applicant’s consent. In that regard, the Crown concedes that the appellate proceedings before the District Court may have been infected by jurisdictional error.
	
	
	There are two issues in my view as to the legitimacy or otherwise of the orders made by Goldring DCJ.
	
	
	The first is whether the failure to enter the orders on the record of the court vitiated them. The second is whether his Honour made valid orders in compliance with the legislative scheme that governed the hearing of appeals from the Local Court at the relevant time.
	
	
	The first question as to the legitimacy or otherwise of the orders pronounced by Goldring DCJ on 4 December 2000 is the failure to enter them on the Court’s record, with the possible consequence that the orders were never perfected and did not take effect.
	
	
	Having regard to the Crown’s concession on that aspect of the matter, it need not be further considered, or determined. As the Crown suggests, I am prepared to consider the failure to enter the orders on the record as no more than a technical error, rather than one that would invalidate the orders of Goldring DCJ, had they been otherwise valid.
	
	
	The second question in relation to the validity of the orders for the attendance of witnesses pronounced by Goldring DCJ is whether his Honour in fact exercised the jurisdiction of the Court properly or at all at the material time.
	
	
	Section 132 of the Justices Act 1902 (NSW) operated in such a way that appeals were to be determined de novo, on the transcript. That general rule could only be displaced by reference to s 133. In relation to the application to direct the complainant to give evidence at the District Court proceedings, such an order could only be made if the Court formed the opinion that there were special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give evidence: s 133(1)(a). In relation to an order directing Senior Constable Van der Hout and the two proposed defence witnesses to attend to give evidence, the Court would have to form the opinion that there were substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give evidence: s 133(1)(b).
	
	
	The meaning of “special reasons” and “substantial reasons” have been considered (in the context of the attendance of witnesses at committal hearings) and it is clear that the test to be applied with respect to an alleged victim – special reasons – is a more onerous test to meet than is the test of substantial reasons that applied to others. See B v Gould & Anor (1993) 67 A Crim R 297; Regina v Kennedy (1997) 94 A Crim R 341; DPP v Losurdo [1998] NSWSC 16; (1998) 44 NSWLR 618.
	
	
	In the present matter, in determining the applicant’s application for a direction to four named witnesses to attend, Goldring DCJ was obliged to consider whether there was a basis to conclude that there were special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the complainant should attend to give evidence and, in relation to the other three witnesses, whether there were substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witnesses should attend to give evidence.
	
	
	On my reading of the transcript of the proceedings on 4 December 2000, that did not occur.
	
	
	The application made to the court by counsel for the applicant was put in very general terms, and did not refer to the statutory basis for the orders that were sought, or to the matters to be considered by the court in determining the application. Counsel asserted generally that:
	


“…we’d like to cross-examine the police officer, Vander Houte [sic] and the victim in this matter, Wolfgang Boege, on the basis that we didn’t have evidence in the hearing of the matter on the last occasion in the Local Court because my client, pursuant to an AVO, was denied access to the property […] Now we would’ve liked to have had those photograph albums in court as an exhibit to put to the witnesses certain things about the way the assault occurred or maybe couldn’t have occurred because of the possession of these photograph albums.” (T2:53 – T3:08)


	
	In response to a question from the bench as to why the police officer was required, counsel answered “He was there” (T3:51). Counsel went on to say that he wished to put “certain things” to both Senior Constable Van der Hout and the complainant in relation to the albums and “who had them and how could certain things happen if he [the complainant] was holding the photograph albums in a particular way” (T4:04).
	
	
	As to the two witnesses whom the applicant wished to call in her case on appeal, counsel said this (again, with no reference to the applicable statutory test or how it could be said that the test had been met):
	


“HIS HONOUR: I see. But you also want some photographs of the property which you didn’t have last --

TRAPP: Yes, well we didn’t have photographs last time either.

HIS HONOUR: Ms Boege, just come and sit behind Mr Trapp there so you can get his attention if you need it.

TRAPP: There were things I would have put to the witness from photographs about where they were when certain things took place. Now it was very difficult to do that in the Local Court because we didn’t have the photographs, we were denied access for the purpose of specifically taking photographs for the hearing.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

TRAPP: And as I say I understand now that those photographs have been taken, we just need to get copies of them.

HIS HONOUR: I see.” (T3:15 – 38)


	
	His Honour then turned to the solicitor appearing for the Crown and asked for her view. Upon receiving the Crown’s response (“a matter for your Honour” T4:47), his Honour said, “I think that’s all I need to hear” (T4:51).
	
	
	Even allowing for the exigencies of a busy circuit sitting of the District Court, and for the efficiency with which matters listed in a circuit sitting must be determined, it does not appear that his Honour ever considered the relevant provisions of the Justices Act 1902 (NSW), or turned his mind to the test at s 133 or, specifically, that he formed the opinions necessary as a condition precedent to the making of a s 133(1)(a) or s 133(1)(b) order for the attendance of a witness.
	
	
	In my view, Goldring DCJ did not exercise the jurisdiction conferred on him by s 133 properly, or at all. If that conclusion is correct, the order he purported to make was itself invalid due to jurisdictional error, and did not bind Shillington QC DCJ.
	
	
	On that analysis, there were no effective orders that Shillington QC DCJ was obliged to give effect to, and his Honour therefore could not have fallen into jurisdictional error as the applicant asserts.
	
	
	For the reasons set out above, I do not regard the orders of Goldring DCJ as valid. Ordinarily, that conclusion would militate against any further consideration of the applicant’s Part 7 application, given that one such application has already been considered and refused.
	


Is There a Question in the Evidence that Gives the Appearance of Doubt?


	
	It is noted that this application has been dealt with on the papers, and the parties did not make submissions on the aspect of the matter upon which I have determined the question of the legitimacy of the orders of Goldring DCJ. The focus of both the applicant and the Crown was on the effect of the absence of a record of the orders on their legitimacy, in light of the “fresh” evidence that established that the orders were clearly pronounced in court.
	
	
	For that reason, and to obviate any unfairness to the applicant, I have decided to consider the applicant’s s 78 application as if the orders of Goldring DCJ were valid, as the applicant contends they are, and the Crown concedes they could be.
	
	
	That necessitates consideration of the evidence that was before the Local and District Courts on the question of the applicant’s guilt of the charge, and the possible effect on the conclusions of the respective courts about that evidence, having regard to the inability of the applicant to test the evidence in the way she asserts she should have been permitted to do.
	
	
	To that end, I have considered the evidence that was before both courts, in transcript.
	
	
	Like Adamson J in Application by Petronella Boege for an inquiry into conviction and sentence pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, I am unable to conclude that the application raises any doubt or question as to the applicant’s guilt, or as to any mitigating circumstance in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.
	


The Relevant Law


	
	Section 78 of the Act relevantly provides:
	


“78 Applications to Supreme Court

(1)   An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person…”


	
	Section 79 of the Act relevantly provides:
	


“79 Consideration of applications

(1)   After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a)   the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or

(b)   the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(2)   Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

(3)   The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a)   it appears that the matter:

(ii)   has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

(iii)   has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

(iv)   has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b)   the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.

(3A) …

(4)   Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.

(5)   The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).”


	
	The statutory provisions provide a mechanism for administrative review where there is a basis to conclude that a conviction or sentence may have been entered contrary to proper principles. In Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383; (2013) 85 NSWLR 783, Basten JA observed, at [52]:
	


“History and statutory language demonstrate that the overriding purpose of Pt 7 is, consistently with the high value placed on freedom of the individual and the unwillingness to allow that liberty to be infringed because of commission of a criminal offence unless the offence has been established beyond reasonable doubt, to provide a means to address doubts as to compliance with these principles. Historically, the need for a mechanism to resolve doubts or questions as to the soundness of a conviction or sentence, so as to avoid an unremediable miscarriage of justice, called for statutory intervention. When appeals became available, that mechanism was not removed but was, indeed, improved upon and made more readily accessible.”


	
	The principles to be applied in determining an application pursuant to s 78 were also considered by Johnson J in Application of Peter James Holland under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 (commencing at [4]) and are as follows:
	



	
	The court performs an administrative act in determining such an application (at [5]);
	
	
	Determination of an application under s 78 is not intended to provide an additional avenue of appeal after the usual avenues have been exhausted (at [9]);
	
	
	The jurisdiction exercised under Division 3 of Part 7 of the CAR Act is an administrative function which may be activated when the criminal justice system has run its course, frequently because additional evidence has come to light which may raise a doubt or question as to guilt or sentence (at [10]);
	
	
	The powers available under s 79 are limited to the direction of an inquiry, or referral of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, there being no power to quash a conviction or sentence (at [10]); and
	
	
	The nature of the jurisdiction under Part 7 allows for flexibility in the material which may be placed before the court relevant to an application (at [11]).
	



	
	Having read the evidence relevant to the question of proof of the offence to the criminal standard, I do not consider that there appears to be a doubt or question as to the applicant’s guilt of the offence of which she was convicted.
	
	
	As has been observed by all judicial officers who have considered the available evidence in this matter, there were inconsistencies between aspects of the evidence of the complainant and that of Senior Constable Van der Hout. However, those inconsistencies do not go to the elements of the offence, and nor are they of such character as to call into doubt the credit of either witness with respect to the evidence going to the elements of the offence.
	
	
	It is common in criminal matters to find differences in the accounts of witnesses as to some features of a contested event; that is a natural consequence of the stressful nature of such events, the relative perspectives of different witnesses and their respective capacity to observe events, and of the imperfection of human memory. Inconsistencies in evidence do not, of themselves, dictate that the evidence of the relevant witnesses should not be accepted.
	
	
	It is always open to any tribunal of fact to accept part of a witness’ evidence and reject part of the evidence of the same witness. What is important and necessary is for the tribunal of fact to determine whether the evidence going to the elements of the offence is both accurate and reliable, and can be accepted beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Whilst the complainant and the informant officer gave evidence which differed as to the sequence and location of the offence, the evidence was in all material matters consistent.
	
	
	The evidence of each that it was the applicant who was the aggressor on this day is also consistent with aspects of her own evidence before the Local Court.
	
	
	There was no dispute that the applicant drove off towards the property whilst the informant and complainant were still speaking by the roadside. On arrival there, and well aware that Senior Constable Van der Hout at least, and probably the complainant, were following her to the property, the applicant went so far as to deliberately take up a wood splitter, and use that heavy tool to smash in the front door to the premises. It was open to the magistrate and to Shillington QC DCJ to conclude that this rash and destructive act evidenced an angry disposition and a willingness to resort to physical force to take those things the applicant thought she was entitled to.
	
	
	The evidence of both prosecution witnesses to the effect that the applicant quickly became verbally abusive towards the complainant is capable of supporting that conclusion. The extreme and degrading nature of the abuse directed at the complainant is also further demonstration of the applicant’s angry frame of mind and aggressive demeanour.
	
	
	The alleged assault was described in consistent terms by the prosecution witnesses and it was well open to the tribunals of fact to conclude that that the account of each as to the assault was accurate and truthful, and could be accepted as reliable. The complete independence of the police officer was also a relevant consideration in that regard.
	
	
	Whilst the applicant had nothing to prove in the criminal proceedings, the magistrate had the benefit of observing her as a witness and this may have informed his assessment of the evidence overall. The applicant’s account of having been “attacked” by both her former husband and Senior Constable Van der Hout lacked credibility, and her demonstration of how the “attack” occurred was decidedly unrealistic, something clearly revealed when the learned magistrate asked the applicant to clarify that aspect of her evidence.
	
	
	Neither was the evidence called by the applicant at the hearing of her appeal such as to give rise to doubt about the reliability of the prosecution evidence.
	
	
	The applicant’s neighbour gave evidence of having seen a bruise between the elbow and wrist of the applicant’s left arm. Importantly, the account the applicant gave to her neighbour of how she had sustained the bruise did not completely support her evidence before the learned magistrate.
	
	
	Elaine Bolton deposed that the applicant told her that she received the bruise when her husband had grabbed the photograph albums from her. She did not mention an attack upon her by her husband, or any attack upon her by a police officer.
	
	
	Linda Muirden deposed that her mother had a bruise on one side of her elbow, although she did not remember which side, or which arm was bruised. Ms Muirden was vague as to when she had observed the bruise, saying only that it was on an occasion before April 2000 when her mother called into a shop Ms Muirden had operated. The applicant told her daughter that the bruise was caused by the complainant assaulting her but, again, there was no reference to any asserted role by a police officer.
	
	
	The location of the bruise seen by Ms Muirden differs to that seen by Ms Bolton, which must cast doubt on the significance of the evidence.
	
	
	The case against the applicant was a reasonably cogent one, and none of the matters about which the applicant wished to cross-examine witnesses on appeal could have materially affected the evidence relevant to the elements of the offence in my view.
	
	
	Additionally, it must be borne in mind that a s 78 application is not to be regarded or treated as an opportunity to run the applicant’s case at first instance again, with the benefit of hindsight, or on the basis that other or different tactical decisions might or should have been made: Application of Peter James Holland at [9].
	
	
	Having considered all of the evidence, I am not left with any doubt or question as to the applicant’s guilt, or as to any mitigating circumstances in the case, or as to any part of the evidence in the case.
	
	
	The application should be dismissed.

2768494,REGINA v MOORE [2015] NSWCCA 316,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

Mr Wayne Moore (the respondent) was an experienced bricklayer and the sole director and permanent employee of KLA Bricklaying Pty Ltd (KLA). In respect of a development in Bondi, KLA employed Mr David Hands (the deceased) as an additional part time bricklayer.

On 12 June 2003, the deceased commenced working on the construction of a kitchen dividing wall. On 16 June 2003, when the wall was freestanding and at a ceiling height, neither braced, nor attached, nor supported by any other structure, the wall collapsed on the deceased. The deceased died from the collapse.

By indictment presented in August 2014, the respondent was charged with involuntary manslaughter for unlawfully killing the deceased. The Crown case was essentially that the respondent owed a legal duty of care to the deceased and his omission to cause the wall to be braced or otherwise provide it with lateral support was a breach of that duty sufficiently serious to constitute gross criminal negligence.

Following argument on this issue at trial, and before the Crown prosecutor had concluded his opening to the jury, the trial judge ruled that there was no duty owed by the respondent to the deceased which could form the basis of the charge. As a consequence, in September 2014, the trial judge granted a permanent stay of proceedings. The Director of Public Prosecutions (the appellant) appealed against the grant of the stay.

The primary issue on appeal was whether, on the Crown case taken at its highest, there was a proper basis upon which the respondent could be held to have owed a duty of care to the deceased.

The Court held (Bathurst CJ, Simpson JA dissenting, Bellew J writing separately), allowing the appeal and dismissing the application for a stay of the proceedings:

1 Involuntary Manslaughter by Criminal Negligence

(i) In order for involuntary manslaughter by criminal negligence to arise, the accused must owe a duty of care to the deceased, i.e. a legal duty to act in a particular way, which was breached in a gross fashion, meriting criminal punishment: [11], [64] (Bathurst CJ); [140], [142]-[144] (Simpson JA).

Nydam v R [1977] VR 430; Wilson v The Queen [1992] HCA 31; 174 CLR 313; The Queen v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67; King v The Queen [2012] HCA 24; 245 CLR 588; Burns v The Queen [2012] HCA 35; 246 CLR 334; R v Taktak (1988) 14 NSWLR 226

2 The Functions of Judge and Jury

(i) The existence of a duty of care is a question of law to be determined by the trial judge rather than the jury. Where the existence of a duty is in dispute, it will be necessary to direct the jury that only if certain facts are found, but not otherwise, will a duty exist: [12] (Bathurst CJ); [148], [153], [190] (Simpson JA).

Burns v The Queen [2012] HCA 35; 246 CLR 334; R v Troy Anthony Cameron (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 27 September 1994, unrep); R v Evans (Gemma) (2009) 1 WLR 1999

3 Whether there was a statutory duty of care based on s 20 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW) (‘the Act’)

(i) The breach of a statutory duty can form the basis of the offence of involuntary manslaughter by criminal negligence. However, the offence is only available for serious contraventions where the degree of negligence is so serious that the trier of fact would regard it as deserving of punishment as a criminal offence: [76], [82] (Bathurst CJ); [255] (Bellew J).

R v Taktak (1988) 14 NSWLR 226; Heaton v Western Australia [2013] WASCA 207; 234 A Crim R 409; Macaree v The State of Western Australia [2011] WASCA 207

(ii) The question in the present case is whether the legislature intended to limit an employee’s liability to the penalties contained in the Act or also subject an employee to potential liability for manslaughter. This question is to be determined by a construction of the whole Act and the circumstances in which it was enacted, including the pre-existing law: [89]-[90] (Bathurst CJ); [255], [257] (Bellew J).

Australian Iron and Steel Ltd v Ryan [1957] HCA 25; 97 CLR 89

(iii) The legislature did not intend for a contravention of s 20 to give rise to liability for manslaughter for the following reasons: s 20 may impose a duty where one would not be imposed at common law; s 20 provided its own penalty for contravention; the Act provided extensive powers of investigation; the Act provided that prosecutions could only be instituted by a limited number of persons; the Act required prosecutions to be commenced within 2 years of the offence; the Act empowered the Court to make orders over and above the imposition of penalties: [89], [92]-[94] (Bathurst CJ); [255], [257] (Bellew J).

(iv) In concluding that the legislature, when it originally enacted s 20, did not intend for a gross breach of the provision to constitute manslaughter, it is legitimate to have regard to subsequent amendments. However, amending legislation cannot be used as an aid to interpretation in respect of a provision which is unambiguous and care must be taken to ensure that words in a later statute have not been inserted to remove possible doubt. In the present case, subsequent amendments to the Act, introducing the offence of reckless contravention of Pt 2 (including s 20) tend to confirm that the legislature did not intend a breach of s 20 to give rise to liability for manslaughter: [95], [98], [99] (Bathurst CJ); [256], [257] (Bellew J).

Grain Elevators Board (Vict) v Dunmunkle Corporation [1946] HCA 13; 73 CLR 70; Hunter Resources Ltd v Melville [1988] HCA 5; 164 CLR 234; Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxes (SA) v Elder’s Trustee and Executor Co Ltd [1936] HCA 64; 57 CLR 610; Kalwy v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1992) 38 FCR 295; Allina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 203; R v Seiders; R v Somsri [2008] NSWCCA 187; 72 NSWLR 417

(v) (Simpson JA in dissent) The issue is first whether, on the Crown case, the respondent was under a statutory duty of care to the deceased and second, whether this duty required him to take steps to brace the wall. In answer to the first question, Section 20 of the Act imposes a duty that is capable of giving rise to a charge of manslaughter. The answer to the second question depends on the facts as they arise at the trial, to be determined by the jury: [218] (Simpson JA).

4 Whether there was a common law duty of care

(i) The mere fact that a person is a director of a corporation does not found a duty to provide a safe system of work for the corporation’s employees. The effect of Andar is not to preclude the imposition of a duty on an employee who is also a director to take reasonable steps to prevent harm to fellow employees, regardless of the circumstances in which the duty is said to arise: [68], [74]-[75] (Bathurst CJ); [193]-[194] (Simpson JA).

Andar Transport Pty Ltd v Brambles Ltd [2004] HCA 28; 217 CLR 424; Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 1; 160 CLR 16; Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee [1999] HCA 59; 200 CLR 1; CSR Ltd v Wren (1997) 44 NSWLR 463; English v Rogers [2005] NSWCA 327; TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Christie [2003] NSWCA 47; 65 NSWLR 1; Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Naidu [2007] NSWCA 377; 71 NSWLR 471

(ii) It would be open to the trial judge to find that the respondent was under a duty to the deceased to take reasonable care to avoid the risk to the deceased from the potential collapse of the wall. A duty of care could arise if the following facts were established beyond reasonable doubt:

a That a reasonable person in the position of the appellant would foresee a risk of serious injury being occasioned to the deceased by reason of the wall not being braced.

b That the deceased was vulnerable in the sense that he was unaware of the danger presented by the unbraced wall.

c That the respondent had assumed responsibility for safety on the site.

d That the respondent had control over the site and the ability to direct that steps be taken to secure the wall.

That the wall could be braced at little cost or inconvenience.

5 The Grant of a Stay

(i) A stay of criminal proceedings will only be granted in an extreme case. The jurisdiction exists at least where the Crown case can be said to be foredoomed to fail. When applying this test, the Court must consider the prosecution case at its highest, on the basis that the Crown witnesses are accepted and all inferences favourable to the prosecution are drawn. Therefore, the question in this case is whether, accepting the Crown case at its highest, any attempt to establish that the respondent owed a duty of care to the deceased was foredoomed to fail: [15]-[21], [26] (Bathurst CJ).

Barton v The Queen [1980] HCA 48; 147 CLR 75 at 111; Jago v The District Court of NSW [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23; The Queen v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; 173 CLR 592; Dupas v The Queen [2010] HCA 20; 241 CLR 237; Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77; 177 CLR 378; R v Smith (1995) 1 VR 10; Nelson (a Pseudonym) v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2014] VSCA 217; RJP v R [2014] VSCA 290; R v McGee [2008] SASC 328; 190 A Crim R 521

(ii) The procedural history of the matter reveals that there has been inordinate delay in bringing the matter to a hearing, it is not clear whether the Crown proposed to rely on the respondent’s statement to the WorkCover Investigator and it is highly undesirable to proceed with a common law offence when statutory provisions are available, or as a substitute for them when the limitation period has expired. However, as none of these matters were in issue, it is for the prosecution to consider whether it wishes to proceed with a charge. Thus, the appeal should be allowed and the stay should be quashed: [123]-[132] (Bathurst CJ).

R v Rimmington, R v Goldstein [2005] UKHL 63; [2006] 1 AC 459; Jago v The District Court of NSW [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23

(iii) The procedural history and necessity to act with fairness towards a defendant in criminal proceedings provides some support for exercising a discretion to dismiss the appeal. However, these factors must be balanced with others, including the seriousness of the allegations and consequences which flowed from the incident. Thus, on the balance, as the decision of the trial judge was erroneous, the appeal should be allowed and the order granting the stay should be quashed: [265]-[267] (Bellew J).

(iv) (Simpson JA in dissent) While ordinarily a decision to prosecute lies exclusively in the jurisdiction of the executive, occasionally that principle conflicts with the necessity for the judiciary to protect its processes against misuse. On balance, taking into account relevant considerations such as fairness to the accused, notwithstanding that the appellant has established that the decision to order a stay was erroneous at the time it was made, the appeal should be dismissed: [250] (Simpson JA).

Barton v The Queen [1980] HCA 48; 147 CLR 75 at 111; Maxwell v The Queen [1996] HCA 46; 184 CLR 501; Likiardopoulos v The Queen [2012] HCA 37; 247 CLR 265; R v Peters and Heffernan (1995) 83 A Crim R 142

Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: The respondent, Mr Wayne Moore (the respondent), an experienced bricklayer, was the sole director and permanent employee of KLA Bricklaying Pty Ltd (KLA).
	
	
	By a contract dated 29 March 2003, KLA agreed to provide bricklaying services in respect of the construction of a residential apartment development at 6 Military Road, North Bondi (the development).
	
	
	In respect of the development, KLA employed a part time bricklayer, Mr David Hands (the deceased), as an additional bricklayer.
	
	
	On 12 June 2003, the deceased commenced working on the construction of a kitchen dividing wall, which, by 13 June 2003, was completed to a ceiling height. On that date, until 16 June 2003, it was a freestanding wall, neither braced, nor attached, nor supported, by any other part of the structure.
	
	
	On 16 June 2003, the deceased was walking towards a toolbox he had left near the wall. The wall collapsed and fell on him, as a result of which he died.
	
	
	By an indictment presented on 4 August 2014, the respondent was charged with unlawfully killing the deceased. The indictment relied on s 18(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the charge being one of involuntary manslaughter. The Crown case was essentially that the respondent had a legal duty of care to the deceased and his omission to cause the wall to be braced or otherwise provide it with lateral support constituted gross criminal negligence. In the Crown case statement, the following particulars were given in regard to the duty of care and its content and standard:
	


“Duty of care

27.   The accused was the deceased’s employer. This relationship gives rise to the accused owing the deceased a legal duty of care.

Content & Standard of care

28.   The scope of the duty owed by the accused to the deceased was an obligation to take reasonable care to avoid exposing the deceased to an unnecessary risk of injury.

29.   The standard of care required of the accused was that of a reasonable employer in the position of the accused in 2003, who was exercising a fair and reasonable standard of care and competence in his employment of the deceased.”


	
	The breach was particularised as follows:
	


“The breach of duty

30.   The accused breached his duty of care towards the deceased by omitting to act such that an internal brick wall at 6 Military Road, North Bondi (constructed in the kitchen of Apartment 1 of Lot 6 as depicted in part plan 1697) was left standing without adequate lateral support or adequate bracing or was otherwise inadequately supported such that it was at risk of collapse. This was a continuous course of neglect from Thursday 12 June 2003 to Monday 16 June 2003.”


	
	Following the opening by the Crown to the jury, the trial judge inquired about the basis on which it was said that the respondent owed a duty of care to the deceased. Initially, it was suggested by the Crown that the source of the duty resided in the relationship of employer and employee. However, the Crown reformulated its case during argument on whether the respondent owing a duty to the deceased was a necessary prerequisite to a conviction for the offence. The primary judge described the duty, as reformulated, as follows:
	


“whatever the full scope of its content the duty allegedly personally owed by the accused to the deceased included a legal obligation to act so as to found liability for the omission relied upon, that is, the failure to ensure that the wall was left standing with adequate lateral support or bracing.”


	
	Following argument on this issue, the trial judge concluded that there was no common law duty owed by the respondent to the deceased which could form the basis of the charge. As a consequence, on 8 September 2014, the trial judge granted a permanent stay of the proceedings.
	
	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions (the appellant) has appealed against the grant of a stay pursuant to s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	


Some preliminary matters


	
	It was common ground between the parties that for liability for manslaughter of this nature to arise, the accused had to owe a duty to the deceased, which was breached in a gross fashion, meriting criminal punishment.
	
	
	The parties agreed that the question of the existence of a duty of care was a question of law to be determined by the trial judge rather than the jury. That approach was correct: Burns v The Queen [2012] HCA 35; 246 CLR 334 at [20]; R v Troy Anthony Cameron (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 27 September 1994, unrep) per Finlay J, Abadee and Simpson JJ agreeing; R v Evans (Gemma) (2009) 1 WLR 1999 at [39], [45]. As was pointed out in the latter case, there will be many instances where the existence of a duty is not in dispute. In more complex cases, however, it will be necessary to direct the jury that only if certain facts are found, but not otherwise, will a duty exist: Evans (Gemma) at [39], [45]; Burns at [20].
	
	
	This division of the functions of judge and jury gives rise to particular difficulties in the present case. The argument before the trial judge took place prior to any evidence having being tested and in circumstances where, unsurprisingly, there was no agreed statement of facts, pleadings or any other document which set out the basis on which the Crown contended that the duty existed. It is necessary to consider the principles which should be applied where a stay is sought in circumstances such as those in the present case.
	


The principles applicable to the grant of a stay


	
	No submission was made to the trial judge that the course upon which he embarked was inappropriate. Further, once the trial judge had concluded that (on the balance) a duty of care did not arise, the parties accepted that the grant of a stay was the appropriate order.
	
	
	For my part, I have some doubt about whether the course of action taken was appropriate. It has been frequently stated that a stay of criminal proceedings will only be granted in an extreme case: Barton v The Queen [1980] HCA 48; 147 CLR 75 at 111; Jago v The District Court of NSW [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23 (Jago) at 34; The Queen v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; 173 CLR 592 at 605-606; Dupas v The Queen [2010] HCA 20; 241 CLR 237. However, the jurisdiction exists at least where the case in question can be said to be foredoomed to fail.
	
	
	In Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77; 177 CLR 378, the plurality, citing Metropolitan Bank Ltd v Pooley (1885) 10 App Cas 210 at 220-221 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69; 112 CLR 125 at 128-130, made the following remarks (at 392-393):
	


“The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay its proceedings on grounds of abuse of process extends to all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the court, which exist to administer justice with fairness and impartiality, may be converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness. Thus, it has long been established that, regardless of the propriety of the purpose of the person responsible for their institution and maintenance, proceedings will constitute an abuse of process if they can be clearly seen to be foredoomed to fail.”


	
	Walton v Gardiner was a civil case, but the principle stated in it has been held to extend to criminal cases. In R v Smith (1995) 1 VR 10 (Smith), the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria, in setting aside an order by the primary judge that proceedings be permanently stayed, emphasised the limited basis on which the discretion should be exercised. Brooking J summarised the position as follows at 14-16:
	


“It must now, it seems, be taken to be established, not only in the United Kingdom but also in Australia, that if civil or criminal proceedings are brought without reasonable grounds the prosecution of those proceedings is an abuse of process and may be stayed as such. Numerous expressions have been used.

So the cases speak of proceedings brought without reasonable grounds, groundless proceedings and manifestly groundless proceedings. In Barton v R (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 96-7, Gibbs ACJ and Mason J, in reasons concurred in by Stephen J at 103, and Aickin J at 109, spoke of criminal proceedings brought without reasonable grounds; the passage is cited in Jago v District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23, by Brennan J at 46, and Gaudron J. at 75. Some of the expressions used in relation to civil proceedings are collected by Barwick CJ in General Steel Industries Inc. v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 125. Other examples might be given of expressions used from time to time. So in Shackleton v Swift [1913] 2 KB 304 at 312 Vaughan Williams LJ said that an action might be stayed if there was ‘plain reason why it must fail’. The decision of the High Court in Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 shows that whether the proceedings are civil or criminal the test is the same when one is considering whether the proceedings are an abuse of process by reason of the fact that they cannot succeed. Civil or criminal proceedings are an abuse of process, not if it can be said of them only that they will very likely fail, but if it can be said of them that it is quite clear that they must inevitably fail. So it was laid down in Walton v Gardiner by Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ at 393 that proceedings will constitute an abuse of process if they can be clearly seen to be foredoomed to fail. This formulation does not differ in substance from that of Brennan J at 411 (‘proceedings which will inevitably and manifestly fail’).

With regard to civil proceedings, there has been some difference of approach on the sense in which a point must be unarguable so as to enable the view to be reached that the proceeding is doomed to failure. I entertain no doubt, however, that, putting the matter at its lowest from the point of view of the prosecution, criminal proceedings are not shown to be an abuse of process as brought without reasonable grounds merely because a judge concludes that the better view is that a case to answer has not been, or will not be, made out. At the very least it would have to be laid down, in favour of the prosecution, that if it was fairly arguable that a case to answer had been, or would be, made out, the criminal proceedings were not ‘manifestly groundless’ or ‘brought without reasonable cause"" or ""clearly foredoomed to fail’.

It is one thing to suggest that criminal proceedings are clearly doomed to failure because on the undisputed facts it is plain that some affirmative defence exists or even because it is plain that the Crown has no evidence whatever which might be said to go towards proving some essential element of the offence. It is another thing where the contention is only that the Crown will probably fail on the facts because the foundation of its case on the facts is ‘slender’, to use the word chosen by Dixon J in relation to civil proceedings in Cox v Journeaux (No. 2) at 720. Such a contention obviously cannot be advanced in order to show that civil or criminal proceedings should be stayed as an abuse of process. But what if the contention, as in the present case, is that the evidence which will be relied on by the Crown to prove some essential element of the crime is not sufficient to enable the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt? I know of no previous case, reported or unreported, in which it has even been argued by an applicant, let alone judicially determined, that a civil or criminal proceeding should be stayed as an abuse of process because it will not be possible for the plaintiff or prosecution to prove some fact essential to the judgment sought. There is to be found an example of an application for a stay of proceedings on an indictment based on the contentions that the delay was such that the trial would be unfair and an abuse of process and that in any event any conviction on the evidence available would be unsafe and unsatisfactory.

As to the second matter, the submission was that the credibility of the two most important Crown witnesses was such that it would not be proper for the jury to rely on any of their evidence. The court dismissed an appeal against the refusal of a stay and in doing so drew attention to the difficulty arising where a court was asked to rule, in advance of the trial, on whether the jury could rely upon the evidence of given witnesses: R v Knox (unreported, New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 29 September 1989).

It may be - we need not decide this - that in a quite exceptional case, where it was plain beyond argument that there was no evidence available of some essential element of the crime, a trial judge, being satisfied of this at the outset, could properly determine that the prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of process. If such an application for a stay was made, it may be that the trial judge would have a discretion to decide whether to deal with the application on the merits or to conclude that the interests of justice would be better served by allowing the prosecution to proceed to the point at which a no case submission could be made. But the present is not at all that kind of case.”


	
	Eames J, agreeing with the formulation of the test by Brooking J, emphasised (at 41) “that it must be clear beyond argument that the Crown is unable to make out a case to answer, having regard to the evidence available to it”.
	
	
	Byrne J reached a similar conclusion. His Honour made the following remarks (at 28-29):
	


“To my mind, however, the no case test simpliciter is not the appropriate one for a case such as the present. It is evident from the expressions used in the passages quoted above from Walton v Gardiner that, for a successful stay application of the kind before us, the case must be not merely incapable of success but ‘clearly foredoomed to fail’; or in the words of Brennan J the vice is the institution of proceedings ‘which will inevitably and manifestly fail’. The intent of these emphasised words is indicated by the cases cited by the court in support of those passages: Metropolitan Bank Ltd v Pooley (1885) 10 App Cas 210 at 220-1; Cox v Journeaux (No. 2) (1935) 52 CLR 713; Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 84, 91-2; General Steel Industries Inc. v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 125. These are all civil proceedings where it is emphasised by the court that the power should be exercised sparingly and only in a clear case. It is sufficient that I refer to the dictum of Dixon J in Cox v Journeaux (No. 2) at 720:

‘The inherent jurisdiction of the Court to stay an action as vexatious is to be exercised only when the action is clearly without foundation and when to allow it to proceed would impose a hardship upon the defendants which may be avoided without risk of injustice to the plaintiff. The principle, in general paramount, that a claim honestly made by a suitor for judicial relief must be investigated and decided in the manner appointed, must be observed. A litigant is entitled to submit for determination according to the due course of procedure a claim which he believes he can establish, although its foundation may in fact be slender. It is only when to permit it to proceed would amount to an abuse of jurisdiction, or would clearly inflict unnecessary injustice upon the opposite party that a suit should be stopped.’

The application of these principles to a criminal proceeding poses further difficulties. First, there are no pleadings properly so called. This means that the practice of determining the prospect of success of the prosecution with little or no reference to the available evidence cannot be adopted. Secondly, it cannot be ignored that the Crown in a criminal trial does not stand in exactly the same position as a plaintiff in civil litigation. The wisdom of a decision to prosecute or to prosecute for a specific offence is not, properly speaking, a matter for the court: Barton v R (1980) 147 CLR 75.

….

In my view, in a case such as the present, the power to order a permanent stay of a criminal proceeding before the court should be limited to the case where it is plain beyond argument that the prosecution case suffers from some incurable vice.

Such a vice must be readily apparent and clearly fatal to the prospect of success of the prosecution. …”


	
	The decision in Smith was reversed by the High Court on the basis that the Appeal Division had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal: Smith v The Queen [1994] HCA 60; 181 CLR 338. However, it was not suggested that the principles applied by the Appeal Division were incorrect. The principles laid down in Smith have been applied subsequently on at least two occasions by the Court of Appeal in Victoria: Nelson (a Pseudonym) v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2014] VSCA 217; RJP v R [2014] VSCA 290.
	
	
	In R v McGee [2008] SASC 328; 190 A Crim R 521, each of Doyle CJ (at [85]) and White J (at [291]) cited Smith with approval. Doyle CJ went on to state that when applying the test in question, the Court must consider the prosecution case at its best and highest, on the basis the Crown witnesses are accepted and all inferences favourable to the prosecution are drawn. He stated that the test was stricter than that applied in considering whether there was no case to answer: at [88]. White J expressed a similar conclusion (at [291]).
	
	
	As was pointed out in the judgment of Byrne J in Smith, in the passage cited above, one reason for the test being a stringent one is that if it were not, the Court would be interfering with the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions to bring proceedings. A similar approach was taken by Doyle CJ in McGee. His Honour made the following remarks (at [87]):
	


“[87]   The reason why the test for a stay of proceedings on this basis must be a stringent one is apparent. If it were not, the Court would be interfering with the decision of the DPP to institute proceedings, and would begin to assume the role of a supervisory authority in relation to those decisions. It is for the DPP to decide whether a charge should be laid, and what charge should be laid. It is the function of the trial judge to preside over that trial, the jury returning its verdict on the charges (unless it is a trial by judge alone). The trial of a charge is not to be precluded because, in the opinion of the presiding judge, the case is a weak one, or even because in the opinion of the trial judge the case is likely to fail. As I said, the function of the Court is to hear the charge, unless there are truly exceptional circumstances that warrant the Court staying the proceedings at the outset.”


	
	In R v Petroulias (No 1) [2006] NSWSC 788; 177 A Crim R 153, Johnson J adopted a similar approach: at [71]-[78].
	
	
	The approach is consistent with the fact that the grant of a permanent stay is an exceptional remedy. It is also in line with the public interest in serious allegations, of the nature of those made in the present case, being disposed of on the merits: Island Maritime Ltd v Filipowski [2006] HCA 30; 226 CLR 328 at [32].
	
	
	The decision of the trial judge to grant a stay, in circumstances where he stated that many of the considerations relied upon by the Crown created an arguable case for concluding that the accused owed a duty of care, but on the balance, a duty did not exist, sits uneasily with the approach mandated by these authorities. It is true that the trial judge was determining a question of law, but, having regard to the way that the Crown put its case, the answer to the question depended to a significant extent on the facts relied on by the Crown. In these circumstances, the stringent test laid down in the authorities should have been applied.
	
	
	However, no consideration was given to the matter by counsel for either party, either before the trial judge or on the hearing of the appeal. If only for that reason, it is necessary for this Court to consider the issue of whether, taking the Crown case at its highest and assuming that all of the evidence tendered before the judge on the hearing of the application will be admissible at the trial, any attempt to establish that the respondent owed a duty of care to the deceased was foredoomed to fail.
	


The factual background


	
	The trial judge made the following findings, which were not contested for the purpose of the appeal.
	



	
	It would be open for a jury to find that the cause of the deceased’s death “was a failure to brace the freestanding wall so as to give it lateral support until such time as the other features of the development that would eventually give it stability were in place”.
	
	
	It would be open for a jury to find that the respondent “was aware that the wall was unsupported. He likely would have been well aware of that from his own presence and activity on the site and his supervision of KLA’s other two employees”.
	
	
	Having regard to his long experience as a bricklayer, it was also open for a jury to find that the respondent “knew or ought to have known that the wall, if left unsupported, posed a potential risk to the safety of workers on the site” or anyone visiting the site for any other reason.
	
	
	It was open to the jury to find that the respondent “consciously and voluntarily, but without any intention of causing direct or grievous bodily harm, made the decision either that it was unnecessary to brace the freestanding wall or, at least, that it would not be done for whatever reason”.
	



	
	The trial judge also referred to the “Bricklayers Safety Plan” (Safety Plan), completed and signed by the respondent. He pointed out that the Safety Plan contained the following statement:
	


“As we build the structure we will make sure that it remains stable and secure from collapse which may be caused by weather, wind, subsidence, construction loads, live loads and the premature removal of temporary bracing or temporary propping.”


	
	The trial judge also referred to the fact that the Safety Plan made provision for the nomination of a person responsible for occupational health and safety. He pointed to the fact that against the call for the nomination were the handwritten words, “as above”, stating that it was ambiguous as to whether this referred to the respondent or to KLA. It seems to me that, for the purpose of this application, it should be assumed in favour of the appellant that in signing this document, the respondent was referring to himself as the person responsible.
	
	
	The trial judge also referred to the statement by the site foreman, Mr Didio, to the effect that he observed that the wall had not been braced and suggested to the respondent that a lintel bar be used to support the wall. In his statement, Mr Didio claimed that the accused said something to the effect of, “No, that’s fine. I have done heaps of them. It will be all right”. That statement was to be disputed at trial. However, for the purpose of this application, it should be assumed that the Crown will be able to establish that the conversation occurred.
	
	
	The primary judge also referred to expert evidence which was proposed to be called by the Crown. This evidence was to the effect that the wall was “unstable”, “extremely vulnerable to overturning from wind load” and “teetering on the verge of collapse”.
	
	
	A statement by the respondent was also tendered. The statement said that the respondent regarded the deceased as a highly competent bricklayer and that he thought that the deceased “had been laying bricks for about forty years”. He also stated that the wall in question, the internal kitchen wall, was built by the deceased.
	
	
	In addition, a record of interview of the respondent by WorkCover NSW was relied upon. In the course of that interview, the respondent indicated that he was aware of the Masonry Structures Code, which stated that “Masonry under construction shall be braced or otherwise stabilized as necessary to resist wind or other lateral forces, in such a manner that the structural integrity of the member is not impaired”. The respondent was asked who he believed had the responsibility to ensure that bracing conforming with that clause was in place. He responded that he did not know, but said that if he thought it was needed, he would supply the bracing. However, he stated that he did not believe that the wall in question needed to be braced.
	
	
	In the respondent’s Workcover NSW interview, he again stated that the wall was constructed by the deceased. He also stated, in answer to a question as to who had the responsibility to ensure that any temporary bracing was in place, that if he thought it was needed, he would have supplied the bracing. However, he also said that he did not really understand how the wall collapsed. He stated that he had been laying bricks for 25 years in the United Kingdom and Australia and this was the first time that he had seen a wall blown over or collapse three days after construction, in a reasonably sheltered area.
	


The reasoning of the trial judge


	
	The trial judge made the findings to which I have referred in par [27] above. Referring to Andar Transport Pty Ltd v Brambles Ltd [2004] HCA 28; 217 CLR 424 (Andar), he pointed out that the duty of care for the health and safety of employees is primarily, if not exclusively, owed by the employer and in the case of a corporate employer, owed by the company itself and not its directors. He pointed out that absent sham, “the doctrine applies even in the case of a sole director/shareholder company”.
	
	
	The trial judge identified the Crown case as asserting that the respondent owed a duty of care to the deceased which was, for all intents and purposes, co-extensive with the obligations owed to the deceased by his employer, KLA. He referred to the Crown’s reliance on the decision of the Ontario Supreme Court in Berger v Willowdale AMC (1983) 145 DLR (3d) 247 (Berger), in which Cory JA (as his Honour then was) found that the president and sole shareholder of a corporation, which was the employer of the appellant, was personally responsible for making the appellant’s workplace reasonably safe, the duty arising because the president was in control of the situation. The trial judge referred to the fact that the Crown relied on 12 matters, which it submitted made the present case analogous to Berger:
	


“1.   The accused is the sole operator, director and owner of the company KLA.

2.   The accused had been a bricklayer since 1979.

3.   On 29 March 2003, the accused, as a director of KLA, signed a contract to lay bricks at the development.

4.   KLA had no permanent employees apart from the accused himself.

5.   KLA employed the deceased as a bricklayer and also employed a labourer to work on the development.

6.   The accused had known the deceased since 1988.

7.   The accused had direct daily dealings with the employees. He recruited them and worked alongside them on the development.

8.   The accused was on site making decisions concerning the business of KLA. He directed or influenced the work carried out by its employees on site, including the work of the deceased.

9.   Due to the geometry of the wall it was in a very unstable equilibrium. Its geometry and the presence of the damp proof course meant that the wall was teetering on the verge of collapse.

10.   The accused had management and control of KLA’s undertaking on site. The accused was directly approached by the site foreman, Mr Didio, concerning the stability of the wall. The Crown case is that Mr Didio raised the suggestion of using a lintel bar to support the wall and the accused allegedly responded in the way I have earlier outlined.

11.   The wall collapsed on Monday, 16 June 2003 when the accused was on site with the deceased.

Finally,

12.   The means by which the wall could have been stabilised or supported were available and would have been easy to erect. Other walls on the site were braced using simple systems.”


	
	The trial judge stated that the approach reflected the “evaluative” or “salient features” approach to the imposition of a duty, outlined by Allsop P (as his Honour then was) in Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258; 75 NSWLR 649 (Stavar) at [102]-[103] (sometimes described as a multifaceted approach).
	
	
	The trial judge stated that many of the considerations relied upon by the Crown, when taken together with such of the additional factors outlined by the President in Stavar as applied, created an arguable case for concluding that the respondent owed a personal duty to the deceased. However, he stated that taking into account the comments in Burns that courts must be circumspect in identifying relations that give rise to a previously unrecognised obligation to act, he concluded that, on the balance, the respondent did not owe the duty contended for. He stated that two factors, in particular, pointed against the existence of such a duty. First, the fact that the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW), as then in force (the Act), governed the liability of the respondent by imposing liability directly on directors and managers to ensure the health, safety and welfare of employees. The second factor was that through principles of accessorial liability, the law already provided a means by which the respondent might conceivably be held accountable for breaches of any duties owed by KLA or for crimes committed by it.
	


The parties’ submissions


	
	The appellant (Crown) relied on three grounds of appeal, each of which essentially asserted that the duty in question arose in different ways.
	
	
	It was first contended that the respondent was under a statutory duty as an employee, pursuant to s 20(1) of the Act, to take action that was necessary to ensure that the wall was properly stabilised. Further, the appellant submitted that the respondent had a duty, under s 20(2) of the Act, to take action in response to the inquiries by Mr Didio, the site foreman.
	
	
	The appellant referred to the judgment of Yeldham J in R v Taktak (1988) 14 NSWLR 226 at 243-244, where his Honour cited with approval the remarks of the United States Court of Appeal, District of Columbia Circuit in Jones v United States of America 308 F 2d 307 (1962) (Jones), to the effect that liability for involuntary manslaughter could arise if a statute imposed a duty to care for another. The appellant submitted that the effect of the Act was to impose a relevant statutory duty sufficient to ground the offence of involuntary manslaughter.
	
	
	It was not entirely clear whether this submission was maintained at the hearing. Ultimately, the position of the appellant appeared to be that s 20 of the Act, to use the expression of senior counsel for the appellant, “illuminates” the underlying duty.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that s 20 of the Act was a statutory penalty provision and an alleged breach could not be used as a mechanism to found an allegation of criminal negligence for the purpose of a charge of manslaughter by criminal negligence. He pointed out that there was a two year limitation on the bringing of proceedings and, at the time the incident occurred, the only statutory penalty was a fine. He pointed out that subsequent to the events in question, s 32A of the Act was introduced, which created the offence of reckless breach of the duties imposed under Pt 2 of the Act (which included s 20) causing death, providing a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. He submitted that even if the amendments were taken into account, it would be anomalous to rely on a contravention of s 20 to found a charge of involuntary manslaughter by criminal negligence.
	
	
	The second basis on which it was said that a duty of care arose (encompassed in ground 2 of the grounds of appeal) was that “the Respondent had played a direct central causative part in the sequence of events which gave rise to the risk that the wall might collapse”. The appellant submitted that the respondent was in charge of the deceased and, at least after the conversation with Mr Didio, “suffered that there was created and continued the dangerous situation that the wall was built without proper lateral support and thereafter remained unsupported against collapse up to and including the day of the incident”.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the duty arose when the wall became inherently unstable.
	
	
	The respondent, in disputing that a duty could arise in this fashion, emphasised the need for circumspection in identifying categories and relationships that give rise to a previously unrecognised obligation to act. He pointed to the fact that cases which have held that a duty arose in this fashion have involved situations where the risk or danger arose as a result of acts done by the deceased.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the respondent pointed out that simply being on site did not impose an obligation on the respondent to supervise or direct his fellow employees. He pointed to the fact that the deceased was a more experienced bricklayer than the respondent and that there was no evidence that the deceased took directions from the respondent.
	
	
	The third basis upon which the appellant submitted that a duty arose was that “there was a novel common law duty of care owed by the Respondent as the director of KLA to the Deceased which could found liability for the offence of manslaughter by reason of criminal negligence”.
	
	
	In that context, the appellant placed particular reliance on the various factors referred to by Allsop P as salient factors in Stavar. It submitted that the harm was “more than reasonably foreseeable” and the consequences “potentially fatal”. It submitted that the respondent had “complete control over the construction method that was to be employed in building the wall”.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the deceased was vulnerable in that he was “under the direct control of the Respondent in relation to both the required manner of construction of the wall and whether or not the wall was to be stabilised”. It also submitted that the deceased was “required to place a high degree of reliance on the Respondent”.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the respondent had assumed responsibility for site management and that there was proximity in the “physical, temporal or relational sense” between the deceased and the respondent, in particular by reason of the fact that the respondent had day-to-day supervision of the deceased.
	
	
	The appellant referred again to the high risk of the wall collapsing and submitted that the respondent had “actual or constructive” knowledge of this. It submitted that there was no potential indeterminacy of liability, as the means of avoiding the harm were simple and there was no “imposition on the autonomy or freedom of individuals, including the right to pursue one’s own interests”.
	
	
	The appellant also submitted that the result contended for was consistent with the result reached in other common law countries, referring in particular to Berger and Yuille v B&B Fisheries (Leigh) Ltd (1958) 2 Lloyd’s Rep 596 (Yuille).
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the situation was not novel, in that it was made clear in Andar at [49] that the common law duty to take reasonable care for the safety of employees is imposed upon the employer, not on its individual directors. He submitted that Stavar was a case where an existing duty between employer and employees was extended to persons who might reasonably come into contact with asbestos residue arising from the employees’ work.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the imposition of the duty in question was inconsistent with the Act, which provided that the standard of care was that the employer ensure the safety of an employee – a higher standard of care than that required by the law of negligence. Further, the respondent submitted that the imposition of the duty in question was inconsistent with the principle that corporations and their directors were distinct legal entities.
	
	
	In regard to the case of Berger, the respondent submitted that the result flowed from the two stage test propounded by the House of Lords in Anns v Merton London Borough Council (1978) AC 728 as a means of determining if a duty of care arises in novel cases, an approach which has been rejected in this country. The respondent submitted that the decision in Yuille depended on its own particular facts, stating that this was recognised in a subsequent decision of the United Kingdom Court of Appeal, The Anonity (1961) 2 Lloyd’s Rep 203. The respondent also disputed the existence of the salient factors identified by the appellant in its submissions. He submitted that the foreseeability of harm was not as obvious as contended for, stating that it did not appear to be apparent to the deceased, who was an experienced bricklayer. He pointed out that both he and the deceased were subject to the direction and supervision of Mr Didio, the site manager.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the deceased was not in a position of vulnerability, submitting that the deceased was “a more experienced bricklayer than the respondent”, who would have had a greater appreciation of the risk involved, particularly if the risk was obvious.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that there was no evidence that he had assumed any responsibility to the deceased. He submitted that he and the deceased “worked with each other over many years” and were working under the supervision of Mr Didio. He submitted that both he and the deceased were employed by KLA and that the deceased had “autonomy to undertake his own unsupervised work on the site”.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the material before the trial judge showed that the respondent did not believe that the wall was required to be braced and denied that Mr Didio raised the issue with him. He submitted that if Mr Didio had had any concerns, he would not have permitted other builders to work immediately around the wall while in an unbraced state.
	
	
	The respondent submitted that the imposition of a duty would give rise to potential indeterminacy of liability. He submitted that it would lead to uncertainty in regard to the circumstances in which a director or manager would become liable to provide a safe system of work for co-employees.
	


Involuntary manslaughter by criminal negligence


	
	Section 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) provides as follows:
	


“18(1)(a)    Murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, or thing by him or her omitted to be done, causing the death charged, was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon some person, or done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years.

(b)   Every other punishable homicide shall be taken to be manslaughter.

(2)(a)   No act or omission which was not malicious, or for which the accused had lawful cause or excuse, shall be within this section.

(b)   No punishment or forfeiture shall be incurred by any person who kills another by misfortune only.”


	
	The common law has long recognised the offence of involuntary manslaughter by criminal negligence. The history of the offence was summarised by Yeldham J in Taktak, with whom Loveday J agreed (Carruthers J generally agreeing). Amongst other citations, his Honour referred to Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England, (1883, MacMillan and Co), vol III at 10-11 to the following effect (at 236-237):
	


“… A number of people who stand round a shallow pond in which a child is drowning, and let it drown without taking the trouble to ascertain the depth of the pond, are no doubt, shameful cowards, but they can hardly be said to have killed the child.

Whether the word ‘killing’ is applied or not to homicides by omission is to a great extent a question of words. For legal purposes a perfectly distinct line on the subject is drawn. By the law of this country killing by omission is in no case criminal, unless the thing omitted is one which it is a legal duty to do. Hence, in order to ascertain what kinds of killing by omission are criminal, it is necessary, in the first place, to ascertain the duties which tend to the preservation of life. They are as follows:— A duty in certain cases to provide the necessaries of life; a duty to do dangerous acts in a careful manner, and to employ reasonable knowledge, skill, care, and caution therein; a duty to take proper precautions in dealing with dangerous things; and a duty to do any act undertaken to be done, by contract or otherwise, the omission of which would be dangerous to life. Illustrations of these duties are the duty of parents or guardians, and in some cases the duty of masters, to provide food, warmth, clothing, etc, for children; the duty of a surgeon to employ reasonable skill and care in performing an operation; the duty of the driver of a carriage to drive carefully; the duty of a person employed in a mine to keep the doors regulating the ventilation open or shut at proper times. To cause death by the omission of any such duty is homicide, but there is a distinction of a somewhat indefinite kind as to the case in which it is and is not unlawful in the sense of being criminal. In order that homicide by omission may be criminal, the omission must amount to what is sometimes called gross, and sometimes culpable negligence. There must be more, but no one can say how much more, carelessness than is required in order to create a civil liability. For instance, many railway accidents are caused by a momentary forgetfulness or want of presence of mind, which are sufficient to involve the railway in civil liability, but are not sufficient to make the railway servant guilty of manslaughter if death is caused. No rule exists in such cases. It is a matter of degree determined by the view the jury happen to take in each particular case.”


	
	In dealing with circumstances in which the offence can be committed, Yeldham J, citing the decision of the United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit in Jones, said that there were four instances in which a failure to act may constitute a breach of a legal duty sufficient to give rise to the offence. The first was “where a statute imposes a duty to care for another; second, where one stands in a certain status relationship to another; third, where one has assumed a contractual duty to care for another; and fourth, where one has voluntarily assumed the care of another and so secluded the helpless person as to prevent others from rendering aid”: Taktak at 243-244. This passage was cited with approval by French CJ in Burns at [22].
	
	
	It was common ground between the parties that the requisite elements of the offence in question were set out correctly by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Nydam v R [1977] VR 430. In a passage approved by the High Court in Wilson v The Queen [1992] HCA 31; 174 CLR 313 at 333; The Queen v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67 at [17]; King v The Queen [2012] HCA 24; 245 CLR 588 at [29] and Burns at [19], the Court in Nydam made the following remarks (at 445):
	


“In order to establish manslaughter by criminal negligence, it is sufficient if the prosecution shows that the act which caused the death was done by the accused consciously and voluntarily, without any intention of causing death or grievous bodily harm but in circumstances which involved such a great falling short of the standard of care which a reasonable man would have exercised and which involved such a high risk that death or grievous bodily harm would follow that the doing of the act merited criminal punishment.”


	
	Although this passage refers to a negligent act, it was not disputed that the offence could arise from an omission. However, as French CJ pointed out in Burns at [21], “issues of duty of care and criminally negligent breach of duty arise most acutely in cases of involuntary manslaughter by omission”. In that context, both the plurality and Heydon J stated that “courts must be circumspect in identifying categories of relations that give rise to a previously unrecognised legal obligation to act”: Burns at [107], [128].
	


Whether a duty arose based on the fact that the respondent was a director of the company


	
	In Andar, the High Court made it clear that the common law duty to take reasonable care for the safety of employees is imposed solely on an employer, as distinct from its directors or employees. The Court made the following remarks:
	


“[44]   Unlike the statutory duties construed in Ginty and its successors, the common law duty to take reasonable care for the safety of employees is imposed solely upon an employer. No equivalent duty was imposed upon Mr Wail in his capacity as employee. In such circumstances, questions such as ‘Whose fault was it?’ are apt to mislead. This is because any breach of duty committed by Andar was inherently different in scope and effect from any negligence of Mr Wail at the time of the accident. It must follow that the requirement of co-extensiveness necessary in order to take advantage of the reasoning evident in cases such as Ginty did not exist in the present case. In Nicol, in a passage with which we agree, Dawson J said:

‘[I]t does not seem to me that the duty of an employer and an employee in such regard can ever be co-extensive or co-terminous. The duty is that of the employer and even if the employee is entrusted with its performance it remains an independent obligation of the employer of a more comprehensive kind to ensure that reasonable care is taken.’

…

[49]   In this way, it is possible here to distinguish between the common law duties owed by Andar and those owed by Mr Wail in his personal capacity as director or employee. The common law duty to take reasonable care for the safety of employees is imposed directly upon Andar by virtue of its status as an employer. The duty is not imposed upon individual directors of a corporate employer. (The duties which directors have are different. For the most part, they are found in the applicable corporations law, and are owed to the company, not others.) To seek, as Andar does, to derive some significance from the circumstance that the board of the company is limited to two directors and that one of those directors (Mr Wail) ordinarily manages aspects of the delivery business is therefore to ignore the nature of the obligation relevantly imposed upon Andar by the common law.”

	As the plurality pointed out in that case, the consequence is that “a company may be charged with an offence as principal, and the director charged as an accessory, notwithstanding that the elements constituting both offences were committed by the director alone”: Andar at [46]; see also Hamilton v Whitehead [1988] HCA 65; 166 CLR 121.
	
	
	This decision authoritatively establishes that the mere fact that a person is a director of a corporation does not found a duty to provide a safe system of work for the corporation’s employees. That would extend, in my opinion, to circumstances where the director was responsible for the implementation of those parts of the company’s activities which gave rise to a particular claim for breach of duty.
	
	
	However, that does not mean that in all circumstances it is solely the employer who is responsible for providing a safe system of work or that the duty is limited to a person’s employees. In Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 1; 160 CLR 16 (Stevens v Brodribb), the High Court concluded that a duty to provide a safe system of work could be owed by a principal to independent contractors. Mason J described the reason for the imposition of the duty in the following terms (at 31):
	


“… Although the obligation to provide a safe system of work has been regarded as one attaching to an employer, there is no reason why it should be so confined. If an entrepreneur engages independent contractors to do work which might as readily be done by employees in circumstances where there is a risk to them of injury arising from the nature of the work and where there is a need for him to give directions as to when and where the work is to be done and to co-ordinate the various activities, he has an obligation to prescribe a safe system of work. The fact that they are not employees, or that he does not retain a right to control them in the manner in which they carry out their work, should not affect the existence of an obligation to prescribe a safe system. Brodribb's ability to prescribe such a system was not affected by its inability to direct the contractors as to how they should operate their machines.”

See also Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Fox [2009] HCA 35; 240 CLR 1.


	
	Similarly, persons other than employers have been held, in particular circumstances, to owe a duty akin to the duty of an employer to provide a safe system of work. In Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee [1999] HCA 59; 200 CLR 1 (Crimmins), a majority of the High Court held that the respondent, which had various responsibilities for regulating the stevedoring industry, owed a common law duty to the appellant to take reasonable care to protect him from a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury arising from his employment by registered stevedores. The majority held that the duty arose as the respondent had knowledge of the special risks to which the members of the class, which included the appellant, were subject, was in a position to control and manage those risks, and the appellant was vulnerable to injury because of the casual and hazardous nature of his employment.
	
	
	In that case, the Court emphasised the importance of the power to direct and control the activities of the person to whom the duty was said to be owed. McHugh J, with whom Gleeson CJ agreed, stated (at [107]) that “usually the very fact of the direction or control will itself be sufficient to found a duty”. He continued, “Where the person giving the direction or in control of another person’s freedom of action knows that there is a real risk of harm unless the direction is given … the case for imposing a duty is overwhelming”.
	
	
	Hayne J, although in dissent as to the result, also emphasised the importance of the power to direct and control. His Honour made the following remarks at [276]-[277]:
	


“[276]   The common law imposes a duty on the employer because the employer is in a position to direct another to go in harm's way and to do so in circumstances over which that employer can exercise control. The duty is, of course, not absolute; it is the duty ‘of a reasonably prudent employer and it is a duty to take reasonable care to avoid exposing the employees to unnecessary risks of injury’.

[277]   Both the power to direct and the power to control are important. As was said by Mason J in Kondis v State Transport Authority:

‘The employer has the exclusive responsibility for the safety of the appliances, the premises and the system of work to which he subjects his employee and the employee has no choice but to accept and rely on the employer's provision and judgment in relation to these matters. The consequence is that in these relevant respects the employee's safety is in the hands of the employer; it is his responsibility. The employee can reasonably expect therefore that reasonable care and skill will be taken’.”

[internal citations omitted]


	
	A number of cases have held that where, as a matter of fact, control and direction over a person’s work activities is exercised by a person other than the employer, such that the relationship bears all of the features of an employer/employee relationship, a duty to provide a safe system of work, akin to that imposed on an employer, will be placed on the person who has such control: CSR Ltd v Wren (1997) 44 NSWLR 463 at 485; English v Rogers [2005] NSWCA 327 at [85]; TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Christie [2003] NSWCA 47; 65 NSWLR 1; Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Naidu [2007] NSWCA 377; 71 NSWLR 471 (Naidu).
	
	
	It does not seem to me that, even applying the stringent test for granting a stay, the mere fact that the respondent was the sole director of KLA and presumably, in that capacity, had power to control how the work was carried out, would be sufficient to impose on him a duty to provide a safe system of work. The imposition of a duty solely on that basis, in my opinion, is contrary to what was decided in Andar and would be a significant extension of liability on companies’ officers who were in control of certain activities of the corporation. Further, I do not think that the evidence referred to above was sufficient to constitute the respondent a “surrogate employer” of the deceased (to adopt the expression used by Spigelman CJ in Naidu at [28]).
	
	
	However, it does not seem to me that the effect of Andar is to preclude the imposition of a duty on an employee who is also a director to take reasonable steps to prevent harm being occasioned to fellow employees, regardless of the circumstances in which the duty is said to arise. Andar was dealing with the non-delegable duty of an employer to provide a safe system of work, not generally with circumstances in which an employee (whether or not a director of the employer) can owe a duty to his or her fellow employees. As discussed below at par [114], in the particular circumstances of the present case, the respondent’s control over the site may be a factor that would support the imposition of a duty of care.
	


Whether a duty arose based on s 20 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act


	
	As I have indicated, the authorities have made it clear that the breach of a statutory duty can form the basis of an offence of involuntary manslaughter by criminal negligence. I have referred to the judgment of Yeldham J in Taktak above. In Peter Gillies, Criminal Law (4th ed 1997, LBC Information Services) at 656-657, the learned author made the following remarks:
	


“Thus, although manslaughter is usually defined in terms of the doing of an act causing death and, indeed, is usually committed by a person so acting, it can be committed by an omission to act. What must be established is that D was under a legally recognised duty, arising from the common law or from statute, to act in a certain way but omitted to do so, that as a result of this omission to act death resulted, and that by D’s omission to act D exhibited the culpability associated with one of the relevant heads of manslaughter. Thus, if negligent manslaughter is relied upon, as it usually is in the context of manslaughter by omission, it must be shown that D acted with any element of mens rea required by this type of manslaughter; or, if it does not require mens rea, that D’s omission to act exhibited the degree of negligence required by the doctrine of negligent manslaughter. In short, D’s behaviour will be exactly the same as manslaughter by commission, except that D’s conduct will consist of an omission.

The spectrum of legally recognised duties grounding liability for an omission is an open-ended one, given that such duties can arise from statute as well as the common law. Standard common law duties grounding liability for manslaughter by omission include that which is vested in the parent of a young and dependent child, or one in loco parentis, and that which is vested in the person who voluntarily assumes responsibility for the care of an adult who is physically or mentally incapable of caring for herself or himself.”

[internal citations omitted]


	
	A similar view was expressed in Brent Fisse, Howard’s Criminal Law (5th ed 1990, Law Book Company) at 120-121, although the statutory provisions to which the learned author refers, on their face, indicate relatively clearly that the common law offence of manslaughter is only available for serious contraventions.
	
	
	In Heaton v Western Australia [2013] WASCA 207; 234 A Crim R 409 (Heaton), the appellant was convicted of manslaughter. He had injected the deceased with heroin and, when she could not be awoken, did not seek to obtain medical assistance. His appeal was dismissed. The relevant breach of duty was a breach of s 262 of the Criminal Code (WA) (one of the statutes referred to in Howard’s Criminal Law) which was in the following terms:
	


“262   It is the duty of every person having charge of another who is unable by reason of age, sickness, mental impairment, detention, or any other cause, to withdraw himself from such charge, and who is unable to provide himself with the necessaries of life, whether the charge is undertaken under a contract, or is imposed by law, or arises by reason of any act, whether lawful or unlawful, of the person who has such charge, to provide for that other person the necessaries of life; and he is held to have caused any consequences which result to the life or health of the other person by reason of any omission to perform that duty.”


	
	The Code did not provide any separate penalty for that offence. The Code provided in s 268 that “[i]t is unlawful to kill any person unless such killing is authorised or justified or excused by law”. The Code also provided in s 280 that “[i]f a person unlawfully kills another person under such circumstances as not to constitute murder, the person is guilty of manslaughter”.
	
	
	In Macaree v The State of Western Australia [2011] WASCA 207 (Macaree), the appellant was convicted of manslaughter for contravention of a duty imposed by s 266 of the Criminal Code (WA). That provision, as relevant, was in the following terms:
	


“266(2)      It is the duty of every person who has in his charge or under his control anything, whether living or inanimate, and whether moving or stationary, of such a nature that, in the absence of care or precaution in its use or management, the life, safety or health of any person may be endangered, to have used reasonable care and take reasonable precautions to avoid such danger; and he is held to have caused any consequences which result to the life or health of any person by reason of any omission to perform that duty.”


	
	In dismissing the appeal, the Court made the following remarks:
	


“[26]   The combined effect of these provisions is that a person may be criminally responsible for an act which occurs independently of the exercise of his or her will if the act is done in breach of the duty imposed by s 266 of the Criminal Code. If a person dies as a consequence of a breach of that duty, the person who committed the breach is held to have caused that death and thereby killed him or her. Such a killing would be unlawful unless authorised, justified or excused (bearing in mind that s 23A has no application). One of the elements of manslaughter is that the killing must be unlawful. Therefore, where the prosecution allege manslaughter by criminal negligence, a breach of the duty imposed by s 266 becomes an element of the offence: Callaghan v The Queen [1952] HCA 55; (1952) 87 CLR 115, 119.”


	
	In each of these two cases, it was stated that to make good the charge of manslaughter, it was necessary to show that the degree of negligence was so serious that the trier of fact regarded it as deserving of punishment as a criminal offence: Heaton at [50]-[51]; Macaree at [48]-[49]; see also Callaghan v The Queen [1952] HCA 55; 87 CLR 115 at 124.
	
	
	It was relatively clear that contraventions of the provisions in those cases which lead to death could found a prosecution for involuntary manslaughter. The provisions appeared in a Criminal Code and, although there was no specific penalty, a contravener was to be held liable for the consequences. The question which arises in the present case is whether a sufficiently serious contravention of s 20 of the Act could have the same consequences.
	
	
	Section 20 was in the following terms:
	


“20   Duties of employees

(1)   An employee must, while at work, take reasonable care for the health and safety or people who are at the employee’s place of work and who may be affected by the employee’s acts or omissions at work.

(2)   An employee must, while at work, co-operate with his or her employer or other person so far as is necessary to enable compliance with any requirement under this Act or the regulations that is imposed in the interests of health, safety and welfare on the employer or any other person.

Maximum penalty:

(a)   in the case of a previous offender – 45 penalty units, or

(b)   in any other case – 30 penalty units.”


	
	The predecessor to s 20, s 19 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 (NSW), was in similar terms to s 20. The Second Reading Speech in respect of the 1983 Act, apart from stating that the general duties contained in it included a duty on employees for safe working practices and allowed for prosecution before magistrates and the imposition of fines up to $5,000, said little in relation to s 19. However, it was said that the object of the Bill was to bring to an end “the frightening effect of occupational injuries”.
	
	
	The Second Reading Speech which introduced the legislation in question in the present case did not elaborate on these remarks.
	
	
	The legislation in question in the present case was repealed and replaced by the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (NSW).
	
	
	It is well-established that an employee can be liable to a fellow employee for a negligent act which it was reasonably foreseeable would cause injury to that employee. Irrespective of whether such an act also contravened s 20, the negligent employee could be liable in manslaughter if a fellow employee died as a result of his or her negligence and the other elements of the offence were also made out.
	
	
	However, s 20 may also impose a duty in circumstances where a duty would not be imposed by common law. This is particularly the case when what is alleged is a negligent omission. The question which arises is whether the legislature intended to limit an employee’s liability to the penalties contained in the Act, or also subject an employee to potential liability for manslaughter, if the other elements of that offence are established.
	
	
	It seems to me that the question falls to be determined by a construction of the whole Act and the circumstances in which it was enacted, including the pre-existing law: Australian Iron and Steel Ltd v Ryan [1957] HCA 25; 97 CLR 89 at 98.
	
	
	Section 32 of the Act stated that nothing in Pt 2 of the Act (which includes s 20) should be construed as conferring a civil right of action or a defence in civil proceedings. I should indicate that I do not regard s 32 as supporting the conclusion that a contravention of s 20 could not give rise to criminal liability for manslaughter. If anything, the express exclusion of civil liability, with no exclusion of criminal liability, tends to the contrary position.
	
	
	However, s 20 of the Act provided its own penalty for contravention. The Act also provided for extensive powers of investigation, including, granting powers to inspectors to require a person to provide information or give evidence in relation to possible contraventions of the Act (s 62), removing the privilege against self-incrimination (s 65), and providing for protection only against direct use, rather than derivative use, of self-incriminating material (s 65).
	
	
	Further, Pt 7 of the Act provided that prosecutions could only be instituted by a limited number of persons and were required to be commenced within 2 years of the date of the offence. That Part also empowered the Court to make extensive orders over and above the imposition of penalties.
	
	
	Taking all of these matters into account, in circumstances where there was no correlative common law duty, I am of the opinion that the legislature did not intend for a contravention of the duty in s 20 to give rise to liability for manslaughter. To enable s 20 to do so would ignore the fact that the Act prescribed detailed remedies for breaches. Liability for manslaughter would, at least potentially, significantly enlarge the circumstances in which that crime could be committed. It is not to be assumed that this was intended by the legislature absent express words or necessary intendment.
	
	
	Although it is not essential to my conclusion, I am fortified by the subsequent amendments to the Act, including the introduction of an offence of reckless contravention of Pt 2 (which includes s 20) in 2005. The section, introduced by the Occupational Health and Safety Amendment (Workplace Deaths) Bill 2005 (NSW), was in the following terms:
	


“32A   Reckless conduct causing death at workplace by person with OHS duties

(1)   In this section:

conduct includes acts or omissions.

(2)   A person:

(a)   whose conduct causes the death of another person at any place of work, and

(b)   who owes a duty under Part 2 with respect to the health or safety of that person when engaging in that conduct, and

(c)   who is reckless as to the danger of death or serious injury to any person to whom that duty is owed that arises from that conduct,

is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty:

(a)   in the case of a corporation – 15,000 penalty units, or

(b)   in the case of an individual – imprisonment for 5 years or 1,500 penalty units, or both.

Note. Section 17 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides, at the enactment of this Act, that the value of a penalty unit is $110. Accordingly, the above maximum penalties are as follows:

(a)   in the case of a corporation - $1,650,000,

(b)   in the case of an individual - $165,000 or imprisonment for 5 years, or both.

(3)   It is a defence to any proceedings against a person for that offence if the person proves that there was a reasonable excuse for the conduct.

Note. Section 28 provides general defences for any offence against the Act.

(4)   For the purposes of this section:

(a)   a person’s conduct causes death if it substantially contributes to the death, and

(b)   the death of a person is taken to have been caused at a place of work if the person is injured at the place of work but dies elsewhere as a result of the injury, and

(c)   it does not matter that the conduct that causes death did not occur at the place of work.

(5)   If a corporation owes a duty under Part 2 with respect to the health or safety or any person, any director or other person concerned in the management of the corporation is taken also to owe that duty for the purposes of subsection (2).

(6)   Section 26 (Offences by corporations – liability of directors and managers) does not apply to an offence against this section. However, this does not prevent a director or other person concerned in the management of a corporation from being prosecuted under this section for an offence committed by the director or other person.”


	
	The Second Reading Speech in respect of the Bill included the following comments:
	


“I turn now to the specific provisions of the bill. The bill creates a new offence where a person who owes a duty under part 2 of the Act engages in conduct that causes the death of another person at any place of work and that person is reckless as to the danger of death or serious injury arising from that conduct. Those who have duties under part 2 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 and to whom the workplace death provision may apply include employers, controllers of work premises, directors and managers, employees and persons hindering the aid of injured workers. ‘Recklessness’ has been defined as heedless or careless conduct where the person can foresee some probable or possible harmful consequence but nevertheless decides to continue with those actions with an indifference to, or disregard of, the consequences.

…

The bill provides for a significantly higher penalty regime in relation to the new offence. These higher penalties are justified given the greater degree of culpability needed to be proven by the prosecution under the new offence. The penalties for this new offence are up to $165,000 for individuals and/or up to five years’ imprisonment and $1.65 million for corporations. These penalties are an appropriate reflection of the gravity of the consequences of the reckless behaviour of the offender. Under this bill a person who is charged with the new provision will be able to use the defence that they had a reasonable excuse. What constitutes a reasonable excuse will be a matter for the court to determine on the particular facts of a case, but will require a compelling and overriding reason why reckless conduct causing death in the workplace might be excused. An example might be where, in an emergency, some action is taken that causes a death in the workplace. The court will be able to take the circumstances of the action into account in determining whether a conviction is warranted.”


	
	The amendment was thus introduced to provide more significant penalties for serious contraventions of Pt 2 of the Act. Although the penalties are less than the maximum penalty for manslaughter, the legislature determined that reckless conduct, as distinct from grossly negligent conduct, should be the touchstone for the offence.
	
	
	In circumstances where it is necessary to consider whether the legislature intended for a consequence of s 20 to be that a gross breach constituted manslaughter, it seems to me to be legitimate to have regard to subsequent amendments in concluding that the legislature, when it originally enacted s 20, did not intend that result: Grain Elevators Board (Vict) v Dunmunkle Corporation [1946] HCA 13; 73 CLR 70 at 86; Hunter Resources Ltd v Melville [1988] HCA 5; 164 CLR 234. In the latter case, Dawson J made the following remarks (at 254-255):
	


“In my view it is possible to draw the conclusion from the nature of the amendments to the Act by the Mining Amendment Act 1985, and, in particular an amendment made to s.105 itself, that it was the intention of the legislature that there should be strict compliance with the manner prescribed for marking out land in respect of which a mining tenement is sought. That conclusion does not arise from the amendments by themselves because none of them mentions the need for strict compliance. But it does arise from the absence of any provision to that effect in the amending Act when that Act is read with both the committee's report and the second reading speech of the minister. Perhaps close reasoning of this sort is unnecessary because s.19 of the Interpretation Act eschews any reference to the intention of the legislature and seems to allow consideration to be given to extrinsic material to confirm on its own account ‘that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text’. The report of the committee would go a long way in establishing this of itself, although I must confess to some difficulty in accepting such a notion: see also Interpretation Act, s.19(3). But even adopting the more traditional approach, albeit with the aid of the extrinsic material, the result is, I think, the same.

In Grain Elevators Board (Vict.) v. Dunmunkle Corporation (1946) 73 CLR 70, at p 86 Dixon J. expressed the view that an amending Act might be taken into account in the interpretation of the prior legislation, at least to avoid a result that would render the amending legislation unnecessary or futile. I would add that it is but a short step to take, having regard to the expanded scope of the materials which now may be considered, to adopt the same approach in order to avoid rendering the amending legislation deficient. After all, what lies behind the observation of Dixon J. in Dunmunkle is that it is permissible to ascertain the intention of the legislature with regard to prior legislation by reference to amending legislation. No doubt there are limits to this approach for as the House of Lords said in Ormond Investment Co. v. Betts [1928] AC 143, at p 154 it is not permissible to construe an unambiguous phrase in an earlier Act by an erroneous assumption of its effect contained in a later Act which did not purport to amend or alter the earlier Act. See per Lawrence L.J., Port of London Authority v. Canvey Island Commissioners [1932] 1 Ch 446, at p 493; see also Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxes (S.A.) v. Elder's Trustee and Executor Co. Ltd. (1936) 57 CLR 610, at pp 625-626. No such limitation applies in this case, however, where the legislature amended the Act but refrained from amending it more extensively upon the assumption, which may be seen from the extrinsic materials, that it already required strict compliance with the relevant provisions. Upon this basis and for the other reasons which I have given, it is my view that the legislation should be construed as requiring strict compliance with the marking-out provisions and the warden was correct in so construing it.”

See also Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxes (SA) v Elder’s Trustee and Executor Co Ltd [1936] HCA 64; 57 CLR 610 at 625-626; Kalwy v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1992) 38 FCR 295 at 299.


	
	Care must be taken in using amending legislation in this fashion. Amending legislation cannot be used as an aid to interpretation in respect of a provision which is unambiguous and care must also be taken to ensure that words in a later statute have not been inserted to remove possible doubt: Allina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 203 at 212; R v Seiders; R v Somsri [2008] NSWCCA 187; 72 NSWLR 417 at [126]-[127]. Nevertheless, in the present case, the subsequent amendment does tend to confirm the view which I have reached that that the legislature did not intend that a contravention of s 20 of the Act would give rise to liability for manslaughter.
	


Whether a duty arose based on the respondent playing a direct causative part in the sequence of events which gave rise to the risk of injury


	
	I do not think that the duty can arise on the basis suggested in the second ground of appeal, namely, that the respondent played a direct causative part in the sequence of events which gave rise to the risk that the wall might collapse.
	
	
	In Burns, French CJ (at [23]) suggested that a duty of care may arise in these circumstances. However, the cases cited by his Honour in support of that proposition suggest that such a duty would only arise where it was the act of the accused or defendant which put the deceased in danger. R v Miller [1983] 2 AC 161 was a case where the appellant went to sleep in an unoccupied house. After lighting a cigarette, he fell asleep and inadvertently dropped the cigarette on the mattress. When he awoke, he observed that the mattress was smouldering, but did nothing to extinguish the fire. The house burnt down and the appellant was found guilty of arson. His conviction was upheld on the basis that when he became aware of the risk he had created, he did not try to prevent or reduce the risk of harm being done to the property: Miller at 177-178.
	
	
	In the second case referred to by French CJ, Evans (Gemma), the appellant gave her half-sister some heroin. After injecting it, the half-sister complained of symptoms consistent with a heroin overdose and died. The appellant’s conviction for manslaughter was upheld on the basis that the appellant had created or contributed to the creation of a state of affairs which she knew or ought to have known was life threatening and failed to take any reasonable steps to save the deceased’s life: at [17]-[18], [31].
	
	
	The third case cited by French CJ, Mitchell v Glasgow City Council [2009] 1 AC 874, was a civil claim by the widow of a secured tenant of a local authority who had been murdered by a fellow tenant. The authority was aware that the murderer had threatened to kill the deceased on numerous occasions. The authority was held not to owe a duty to protect the tenant. Although Lord Scott of Foscote (at [40]) cited the principle referred to by French CJ, it was held to have no application in that case.
	
	
	In the present case, it was not suggested that the respondent was responsible for the construction of the wall or its design. In circumstances where his act did not cause the danger to arise, it does not seem to me that a duty could be imposed on this basis.
	


Whether a duty arose based on the particular relationship between the respondent and the deceased


	
	The duty contended for by the Crown was that, in the particular circumstances, the respondent was under a duty to the deceased to take reasonable care to avoid the risk to the deceased from the potential collapse of the wall.
	
	
	In the well-known passage in his judgment in Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman [1985] HCA 41; 157 CLR 424, Brennan J emphasised (at 487) that “a postulated duty of care must be stated in reference to the kind of damage that a plaintiff has suffered and in reference to the plaintiff or a class of which the plaintiff is a member”: see also Tame v New South Wales [2002] HCA 35; 211 CLR 317 (Tame) at [249]; Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales v Dederer [2007] HCA 42; 234 CLR 330 at [43]-[44]; Vairy v Wyong Shire Council [2005] HCA 62; 223 CLR 422 at [59]-[60]. Further, reasonable foreseeability of the damage suffered is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for liability: see Crimmins at [72]; Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59; 207 CLR 562 at [42]; Tame at [45], [103].
	
	
	In Sydney Water Corporation v Turano [2009] HCA 42; 239 CLR 51, the Court explained the relevance of the reasonable foreseeability of the class of injuries suffered, in the following terms (at [45]):
	


“[45]   Reasonable foreseeability of the class of injury is an essential condition of the existence of a legal obligation to take care for the benefit of another. The concept is relevant at each of the three, related, stages of the analysis of liability in negligence: the existence and scope of a duty of care, breach of the duty, and remoteness of damage. At the first stage, the inquiry has been said to involve the assessment of foreseeability conducted at ‘a higher level of abstraction’ than at the subsequent stages. However, to speak of a higher level of abstraction in dealing with that first stage does not support a formulation of duty in terms devoid of meaningful content. It remains, as Gleeson CJ observed in Tame v New South Wales, that the concept is to be understood and applied with due regard to the consideration that, in the context of the issue as to duty of care, it is bound up with the question of whether it is reasonable to require a person to have in contemplation the risk of injury that has eventuated.”

[internal citations omitted]


	
	In the present case, it seems to me that the Crown would be able to lead evidence which, if accepted by a jury, would demonstrate that the injury was reasonably foreseeable to a person in the position of the respondent. The trial judge reached a similar conclusion, without reference to the statement of Mr Didio (see par [27](2)-(3) above). If the Crown was able to prove that that statement was made, then its prospects of proving that the injury was reasonably foreseeable would be enhanced.
	
	
	There remains of course the question of whether, in those circumstances, the relationship between the respondent and the deceased was such that a claim that the respondent owed a duty to the deceased was foredoomed to fail.
	
	
	In Sullivan v Moody, the Court pointed out (at [50]) that the question of the existence of a duty involves “a judicial evaluation of the factors which tend for or against a conclusion, to be arrived at as a matter of principle”. In Stavar, Allsop P (at [102]) pointed out that “If … the posited duty is a novel one, the proper approach is to undertake a close analysis of the facts bearing on the relationship between the plaintiff and the putative tortfeasor by references [sic] to the ‘salient features’ or factors affecting the appropriateness of imputing a legal duty”. I agree, but would add that any legal reasoning should proceed by way of analogy from decided cases: Crimmins at [74]; Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v Owners of Strata Plan No 61288 [2014] HCA 36; 88 ALJR 911 (Brookfield Multiplex) at [24]-[25].
	
	
	In the present case, as I have indicated, it would be open to the jury to find, as a matter of fact, that it was reasonably foreseeable that there was a danger that the wall would collapse. It would seem to me to follow from this that it was also open to the jury to conclude that it was reasonably foreseeable that such a collapse could cause serious injury or death to persons working in the near vicinity of the wall.
	
	
	It would also be open to the jury to conclude that the deceased was vulnerable, in the sense described in cases such as Perre v Apand Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 36; 198 CLR 180 at [118]; Crimmins at [100] and Brookfield Multiplex at [130]. If the jury was satisfied that the deceased was unaware of the danger, which the respondent was aware of as a result of his conversation with Mr Didio, then it could be found that the deceased, by reason of his lack of knowledge of the risk, was not in a position to protect himself.
	
	
	Further, it would be open to the jury to find that, by signing the safety plan, the respondent assumed responsibility for safety on the site. Although assumption of responsibility is not a determinative factor in the question of whether a duty exists, it remains a relevant factor to take into account: Stavar at [103].
	
	
	Importantly, it would be open to the jury to find that the respondent had control over the site and the ability to direct that steps be taken to properly secure the wall. The importance of such a power to direct and control has been emphasised in a number of cases: Stevens v Brodribb at 31; Kondis v State Transport Authority [1984] HCA 61; 154 CLR 672 at 687-688. In Crimmins (at [107]) McHugh J, with whom Gleeson CJ agreed, emphasised the importance of the power to direct and control (see par [71] above).
	
	
	Further, it would be open to the jury to find that the wall could be braced at very little cost or inconvenience: see Stavar at [103]. Finally, there is no question in the present case of any indeterminacy of liability. The only persons to whom the respondent would owe a duty were persons working near the site of the wall during the course of the construction.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it seems to me that if a jury found these facts, it would be open to the judge to conclude that the respondent owed the duty contended for by the Crown. It cannot be said that such a contention is foredoomed to fail.
	
	
	The trial judge emphasised two matters which influenced him in reaching a contrary conclusion. The first was that the Act governed the liability of the respondent. There is no doubt that the statutory obligations imposed on the respondent were relevant in considering whether or not a duty of care arises. However, as was pointed out in Sullivan v Moody at [60], the fact that the legislature imposes statutory obligations which constrain a person’s activities does not rule out the possibility of a duty of care arising. In the present case, s 32(b) of the Act makes it clear that the provisions dealing with the obligations of directors and employees do not affect any right of action in civil proceedings. While, as I have indicated, the relevant sections, of themselves, do not impose the duty said to be owed, they do not rule out the possibility of such a duty existing in the particular circumstances of the case.
	
	
	The second factor which the trial judge said influenced him in his decision was that the law may otherwise provide a remedy, through the principle of accessorial liability, for both the criminal and civil wrongs of a corporation.
	
	
	As I indicated earlier, a director can be criminally liable as an accessory when his or her acts cause the corporation to commit the principal offence. However, that does not seem to me to exclude the possibility of a director, employer or agent of a company owing a separate duty of care to a third party, if warranted by the particular circumstances of the case.
	
	
	Further, to the extent that the trial judge suggested that the respondent could be civilly liable for the failure of KLA to provide a safe system of work, the proposition, in my opinion, is contrary to what the High Court said in Andar at [49]. It cannot be said that merely because the company acted through the respondent that the respondent was liable as a joint tortfeasor: O’Brien v Dawson [1942] HCA 8; 66 CLR 18 at 32. It may be that the respondent would be liable to KLA for a breach of duty owed by him to that company. However, that does not preclude the respondent also owing a duty to the deceased if the imposition of a duty was warranted in the particular circumstances.
	
	
	It follows that a duty of care could arise if the following facts were established beyond reasonable doubt.
	



	
	That a reasonable person in the position of the appellant would foresee a risk of serious injury being occasioned to the deceased by reason of the wall not being braced.
	
	
	That the deceased was vulnerable in the sense that he was unaware of the danger presented by the unbraced wall.
	
	
	That the respondent had assumed responsibility for safety on the site.
	
	
	That the respondent had control over the site and the ability to direct that steps be taken to secure the wall.
	
	
	That the wall could be braced at little cost or inconvenience.
	



	
	As it is possible that these facts could be established, it cannot be said that the Crown case is foredoomed to fail. In these circumstances, the appeal should be allowed.
	


Some other matters


	
	I have reached the conclusion above with considerable reluctance. This is for a number of reasons. First, there has been inordinate delay in bringing this matter to a hearing. The alleged crime occurred on 16 June 2003. The police interviewed the respondent (apparently without caution) on 18 June 2003. The WorkCover NSW Investigator obtained a statement from him on 2 September 2003. Mr Didio was also interviewed in September 2003.
	
	
	Thereafter, nothing appears to have been done until 8 December 2005, when Mr Didio was charged with manslaughter. He was discharged at committal. It should be noted that the charge was brought after the limitation period for the bringing of proceedings under s 107 of the Act had expired.
	
	
	On 13 December 2005, the respondent returned to the United Kingdom. On 28 December 2005, an arrest warrant for the respondent was issued by the Waverley Local Court. Apparently, the respondent was discovered living in Wales in August 2009, but it was not until October 2012 that any formal request for extradition was made.
	
	
	The delay, to say the least, is unfortunate. Although there is no right to a speedy trial (Jago), delay of this nature, at the very least, places a significant burden on the respondent in defending the charges.
	
	
	Second, this case hardly seems to be a strong case of criminal negligence. Mr Didio, the site foreman, was discharged at committal. If one accepts that he had the communication, to which I have referred in par [30] above, it appears that he accepted what the respondent told him. The deceased, who was an experienced bricklayer, apparently did not perceive the danger. I have indicated above (par [34]) that the respondent stated that in his experience, what occurred was exceptional.
	
	
	On this material, it is difficult to see how a jury could conclude that the respondent’s negligence was such that it warranted criminal punishment.
	
	
	Third, it is not clear that the Crown proposes to rely on the respondent’s statement to the WorkCover NSW Investigator. As the respondent was not advised that he was entitled to object to answering questions on the basis that it might incriminate him, the statement would not be admissible if objection was taken: the Act s 65(2)(b).
	
	
	Finally, irrespective of whether the offence of manslaughter is available in the circumstances of the present case, it seems to me to be highly undesirable to proceed with a common law offence when the statutory provisions are available, or, as a substitute for them when the limitation period has expired. This question was considered by Lord Rodger of Earlsfelly in R v Rimmington, R v Goldstein [2005] UKHL 63; [2006] 1 AC 459.. His Lordship made the following comments:
	


“[52]   When Parliament enacted the statutory offences, it did not expressly abolish the corresponding aspect of the common law offence of public nuisance. Therefore, if - contrary to my view - Mr Rimmington's conduct in writing the letters had amounted to a public nuisance, it would presumably have continued to do so even after the statutory offences were introduced. So a charge could not have been regarded as bad simply because it was framed in terms of the common law rather than in terms of the statute. To put the matter more generally, where Parliament has not abolished the relevant area of the common law when it enacts a statutory offence, it cannot be said that the Crown can never properly frame a common law charge to cover conduct which is covered by the statutory offence. Where nothing would have prevented the Crown from charging the defendant under the statute and where the sentence imposed would also have been competent in proceedings under the statute, the defendant is not prejudiced by being prosecuted at common law and can have no legitimate complaint.

[53]    Here, however, according to what Mr Perry told the House, the Crown had deliberately chosen the common law offence in order to avoid the time-bar which Parliament had enacted and to allow the judge, if he thought fit, to impose a heavier sentence than the one permitted under statute. The issue bears some resemblance to the issue in  R v J  [2005] 1 AC 562 . There is no suggestion, of course, that the Crown acted in bad faith. On the contrary, it is easy to understand why they did what they did. In a particular case, such as this, a time-limit which prevents prosecution once a certain time has passed since the act was committed can appear to be arbitrary and to reward an offender for concealing his offences. The sentence available under the statute may also seem inadequate to reflect the gravity of the defendant’s conduct. But Parliament has deliberately chosen to intervene and to prescribe a period within which conduct of this kind can be prosecuted summarily under statute. This must be taken to reflect Parliament’s judgment that, if the conduct has not been prosecuted within that time, the public interest is now against proceeding. That judgment may be based on various factors. Parliament may, for example, consider that after a certain period everyone should move on and prosecutors should turn their attention to other matters. Police and prosecution resources, it may be thought, are better spent on detecting and prosecuting recent, rather than stale, offences of this kind or recent, rather than old, incidents in a course of conduct. More serious matters should be given priority. Similarly, in the matter of sentence, Parliament has reached a view that certain conduct is appropriately covered by an offence which can be tried only summarily and which should attract no more than a particular level of sentence. Parliament has also fixed the maximum sentence to be imposed in summary proceedings, even where the defendant is convicted of more than one charge. Again, in any particular case, the sentence available under statute may appear to the prosecutor to be inadequate. But Parliament is entitled to place an offence in what it regards as the appropriate level in the hierarchy of offences and to limit the sentencing power of a court where the accused is not tried by jury.

[54]    It is not for the Crown to second-guess Parliament’s judgment as to any of these matters by deliberately setting out to reject the applicable statutory offences and to charge the conduct in question under common law in order to avoid the time-limits or limits on sentence which Parliament has thought appropriate. It may be that, in the light of experience, Parliament’s judgment can be seen to have been flawed or to have been superseded by events. Doubtless, the prosecuting authorities have channels through which they can - and perhaps should - draw any such perceived deficiencies to the attention of the Home Secretary. It is then up to ministers and, ultimately, Parliament to decide whether the law should be changed. But, unless and until it is changed, its provisions should be respected and the Crown should not devise a strategy to avoid them.”

See also Lord Bingham of Cornhill at [30].


	
	However, none of these matters were in issue in the present case. It was for the prosecution to consider whether it wished to proceed with a charge.
	
	
	In the result, the orders I would make are as follows:
	



	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	Quash the stay granted by Whitford DCJ on 8 September 2014.
	



	
	SIMPSON JA: Pursuant to s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), the Director of Public Prosecutions (“the Director”) appeals against an order of the District Court, made on 8 August 2014, permanently staying an indictment that charged the respondent, Wayne Moore, with the manslaughter, on 16 June 2003, of David Hands.
	
	
	Since, in a number of respects, I take a different view to that expressed by the Chief Justice, whose judgment I have read in draft, it is appropriate that I set out the relevant facts and circumstances.
	
	
	The Crown alleged that the respondent was guilty of manslaughter by criminal negligence, constituted by his omission to do an act that he was under a legal obligation to do. The primary judge held that there was “no warrant to impute a duty on [the respondent] to act positively to ensure the safety of [Mr Hands]” and that there was “no common law duty on [the respondent] which relevantly founds his liability as a principal in respect of the offence charged”. In those circumstances, the Crown case could not succeed, and it was appropriate to grant a permanent stay of the indictment.
	
	
	The issue for present determination is whether the evidence proposed to be adduced in the Crown case was such that, if accepted, it could found a conviction for manslaughter. Specifically, the issue concerns the existence (or otherwise) of a duty of care owed by the respondent to Mr Hands, and, if there is such a duty, the content of that duty.
	
	
	The order was made in the very early stages of the trial of the respondent, before the Crown prosecutor had concluded his opening to the jury. That had the consequence that the issues were determined in the District Court, and must be determined in this Court, on the basis of the evidence that the Crown proposed to adduce, and on the assumption that that evidence would be accepted.
	


Stay of proceedings


	
	A stay of criminal proceedings is, as the Chief Justice has explained, an exceptional remedy, available (essentially) only where it can be seen that the prosecution cannot succeed.
	
	
	The primary judge found that the prosecution could not succeed. If that view were correct, a stay was an appropriate remedy. If, however, that view were incorrect, a stay ought not to have been granted. The Director asserts that the view was incorrect. To determine whether it was incorrect, in the particular circumstances of the case, it is necessary to understand the offence of manslaughter by criminal negligence.
	


Manslaughter by gross criminal negligence


	
	Consideration of the offence of manslaughter by criminal negligence cannot begin without the classic statement of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Nydam v R [1977] VR 430. Their Honours (Young CJ, McInerney and Crockett JJ) said:
	


“In order to establish manslaughter by criminal negligence, it is sufficient if the prosecution shows that the act which caused the death was done by the accused consciously and voluntarily, without any intention of causing death or grievous bodily harm but in circumstances which involved such a great falling short of the standard of care which a reasonable man would have exercised and which involved such a high risk that death or grievous bodily harm would follow that the doing of the act merited criminal punishment.”

That statement has been adopted and approved on many occasions: for example The Queen v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67; Burns v The Queen [2012] HCA 35; 246 CLR 334 (at [19]-[20]).


	
	Useful as the statement is, it does not touch upon that feature of the offence with which this appeal is concerned.
	
	
	The offence of manslaughter by gross criminal negligence is derived from the tort of negligence, with an additional important element. The elements of the tort of negligence are:
	


(i)  that a person (A) owes to another person (B) a duty of care;

(ii)  that, by act or omission, A is in breach of that duty of care;

(iii)  that B suffers injury or harm;

(iv)  that there is a causal connection between the breach of duty and the harm or injury suffered.


	
	It is necessary that there be identity between the act or omission constituting the breach of duty, and the act or omission that causes harm.
	
	
	The important additional element necessary to constitute the criminal offence of manslaughter is:
	


(v)  that the breach of duty is so gross as to warrant the intervention of the criminal law, and criminal punishment. (Of course, the injury or harm the subject of elements (iii) and (iv) must be the death of B.)


	
	It is only the first of these elements that calls for consideration in the present case. It will be observed that that element is framed in general terms, that of the existence of a duty of care. That also is how the first element was framed by French CJ in Burns (at [20]). The plurality, however, stated the obligation more narrowly. Their Honours framed the duty element of the offence in terms of an obligation to do a specific act (at [97]). That, no doubt, was because criminal liability does not attach to an omission to act, unless that omission is of an act that the accused person is under a legal obligation to do: see R v Taktak (1988) 14 NSWLR 226 at 236-237. Failure to do an act that the person may be seen to have a moral obligation to do is insufficient: Burns, at [97].
	
	
	A conviction for manslaughter by criminal negligence constituted by an omission, or failure, to act can therefore be sustained only where the person accused was under a legal duty to act in a particular way - that is, to do the specific act the omission of which was the cause of death. Such a duty may arise:
	



	
	from a relationship recognised at common law as giving rise to such a duty: examples are a relationship of employer and employee; parent and child; doctor and patient (there are many more);
	
	
	from an express or implied statutory duty;
	
	
	where the defendant has created a dangerous situation and subsequently fails to take steps to prevent the consequences of that dangerous situation (see R v Evans (Gemma) [2009] EWCA Crim 650; [2009] 1 WLR 1999; [2010] 1 All ER 13).
	



	
	There has also been recent discussion suggesting that, at least for the purposes of tort law, new or “novel” situations may arise in which a duty of care, not previously recognised, may be imputed: Caltex Refineries (QLD) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258; 75 NSWLR 649. However, in Burns (in the context of criminal liability) the High Court urged “circumspection” in extending categories of relationships that give rise to a previously unrecognised obligation to act (at [107]).
	
	
	In Burns at [20], citing Evans (Gemma) at [31], the Chief Justice held that whether, in a given set of circumstances, a duty of care exists is a question of law, to be decided by the judge. However, the existence (or otherwise) of a duty of care depends upon the existence of relevant facts, determination of which lies in the province of the jury. There may be practical difficulties in the application of this principle in a jury trial. At the point when it is necessary for a trial judge to decide whether a duty of care exists, he or she will not know what facts the jury has found. It would, of course, be possible to direct the jury, hypothetically, that IF a particular set of facts is found to exist, THEN a duty of care exists. That may be feasible if the determination depends upon one fact or even a limited number of facts: it becomes unworkable if the hypothesised factual basis for proposing the duty includes multiple facts. How many (or which, or which combination) of the postulated facts will suffice to establish the duty? Do the postulated facts (or any of them) have to be found beyond reasonable doubt? Does the jury have to be unanimous on the finding of the facts?
	
	
	In part, these difficulties were recognised in Evans (Gemma), at [45]. It is of interest that, in Evans (Gemma), the court consistently, throughout the judgment, disjunctively coupled “a duty of care” with “a duty to act”. I take “a duty to act” to mean “to act in the particular respect, omission to do which was the cause of death”. This more closely approaches the manner in which the plurality in Burns expressed the duty, as a particular act that the accused person was under a legal obligation to do.
	
	
	Nevertheless, difficult questions can arise. In Evans (Gemma) the Court of Appeal gave an illustration. It is undoubted that a doctor owes a patient a duty of care. It is not always so clear that a doctor/patient relationship exists. The Court of Appeal cited the circumstances where a doctor, on a social occasion, is asked a casual (medical) question.
	
	
	Merely finding that a duty of care exists does not end the inquiry. The more apposite question is: what does the duty entail? This question is often entangled with the question that arises with respect to the second element - breach of the duty. A finding of breach of duty requires an appreciation of the boundaries of the duty. The question of breach is not answered only by reference to the nature of the relationship, but will frequently depend upon the facts alleged - and proved - by the prosecution. Whether the issue is approached, as by the Chief Justice in Burns, by reference to a generalised “duty of care” (in which case the key question is breach), or as by the plurality, by reference to an obligation to act in a particular way, the answer will depend upon findings of fact going outside the existence of the relationship asserted.
	
	
	That does not necessarily mean that, in a proper case, the first element cannot be decided in advance of the evidence in the trial. More often, however, whether a duty of care is shown to exist, and, more importantly, what such a duty entails, will depend upon relevant findings of fact by the jury.
	
	
	Where there are disputed issues of fact relevant to the existence or otherwise of a duty of care, or its content, a ruling as to that existence may only be made contingently.
	
	
	These considerations make it plain that a ruling as to the existence of a duty to do a particular act can rarely (if ever) be made in advance of a jury determination of the facts.
	


Chronology


	
	The issues to be determined in this case will be clearer to the reader if I take time to set out certain relevant facts and circumstances in chronological order. I should emphasise that, so far as the following purports to be an account of the facts and circumstances of the alleged offence, it is drawn from material the Crown proposes to adduce in evidence. Although a good deal of it appears to be uncontroversial, what follows does not purport, and should not be taken, to be a statement of established fact. Some of the events recorded are drawn from a chronology which appears to have been provided as part of a Crown Case Statement. As no issue was taken with any of the content of the chronology, it may be relied upon for the purpose of understanding the history.
	
	
	In 2003 the respondent was (and had been for many years) a qualified bricklayer. He was the sole director, and also an employee, of a company called KLA Bricklaying Pty Ltd (“KLA”). In 2003 KLA contracted with Innovative Property Developments (“Innovative”) to undertake bricklaying on a site at Military Road, North Bondi, where Innovative was carrying out construction work on a residential apartment development. For that purpose, KLA employed Mr Hands, who was also a qualified bricklayer. The respondent also performed bricklaying work. Also engaged on the site, as foreman, was a Rick Didio, a registered builder with significant experience.
	
	
	The contract into which KLA entered with Innovative obliged KLA, and its agents and employees, inter alia, to observe all relevant occupational health and safety laws, and to ensure that no person, whether employed or not, was exposed to risk to health or safety, and that trade works were carried out on the site using a safety management system.
	
	
	A short time after signing the contract on behalf of KLA, the respondent signed a “Bricklayer’s Safety Plan” that named KLA as “trade contractor”. Under the heading “Controls and Implementation” (and with respect to “Risk/Safety Issue”) the following appeared:
	


“Stability: As we build the structure we will make sure that it remains stable and secure from a collapse, which may be caused by: weather, wind, subsidence, construction loads, live loads, and the premature removal of temporary bracing or temporary propping.”


	
	On 10 June 2003 the respondent, Mr Hands and a Martin Nolan commenced work on the site. On 12 June work began on an internal kitchen wall. The wall was freestanding, about 1095 mm in length by 3055 mm in height by 109 mm in depth, of bricks, with inbuilt flashing. It was intended that at a later date kitchen cupboards would be installed that would stabilise the wall. As at 12 June those cupboards had not been installed, and no bracing had been supplied to the wall to provide stabilisation.
	
	
	At the end of the day Mr Didio checked the bricklaying work. He noticed that the kitchen wall was not braced to any other structure. He had a conversation with the respondent about bracing, suggesting the use of a lintel bar to provide support. The respondent declined, saying that he had performed similar constructions and that “that will be right”. (As the Chief Justice notes, that conversation is in issue. However, it is relevant for present purposes as it constitutes part of the evidence upon which the Crown seeks to rely.)
	
	
	Over the next three days, more work on the site was performed by other sub-contractors.
	
	
	At about 10.00am on Monday, 16 June, Mr Hands was working on the north side of the internal kitchen wall. The wall collapsed on him. He suffered severe injuries that resulted in his death.
	
	
	On 18 June 2003 the respondent made a statement at the Waverley Police Station concerning the death of Mr Hands. He said that he, Mr Hands, and Mr Nolan had begun work on the site on 10 June. On or after 12 June, a Thursday, Mr Hands began building the internal kitchen wall, while the respondent worked on another wall nearby. He said:
	


“11  Due to the fact that the external wall had already been built there was no need to brace this internal wall. Any gusts of wind would have been blocked from the internal wall by the outer wall. On Friday 13 June, 2003 we continued building the top half of the outer skin …

12  About 6.45am on Monday 16th June, 2003 I arrived at the site with Martin [Nolan] and David [Hands]. I had picked them up on the way to the site. When we got there we looked at the site. All the walls were still as they were on Friday including the internal kitchen wall …”

He went on to outline the circumstances in which he became aware that the wall had collapsed and injured Mr Hands.


	
	On 2 September 2003 the respondent was interviewed by an Inspector of WorkCover NSW. There is no indication that any caution was administered to the respondent before this interview. He was expressly asked about the clause in the Bricklayers’ Safety Plan concerning stability, and whether he believed that the kitchen wall that collapsed was covered by the conditions of this clause. He said that he did not think so because:
	


“… 70% of the wall was set hard before 30% was completed. So it was already stable.”

He was also asked about an Australian Standard relevant to masonry structures and said that he believed that the kitchen wall structure conformed to the Standard. In response to a specific question he said:

“If I thought it was needed I would supply the bracing.”

He said he did not understand how the wall had collapsed, but that some form of bracing fitted into the slab might have prevented that from occurring.


	
	On 8 December 2005 Mr Didio was charged with the manslaughter of Mr Hands. (He was discharged at committal on 1 September 2006.)
	
	
	On 13 December 2005 the respondent, who is a citizen of the United Kingdom, left Australia for London on a way ticket. There is no suggestion in the evidence that, at the time he left Australia, he was aware of any proposal to charge him, or that he departed for the purpose of avoiding prosecution. On 28 December 2005 a warrant for his arrest was issued out of the Waverley Local Court. From 2007-2008 NSW Police initiated extradition proceedings against him. In August 2009 he was discovered living at an address in Wales. On 26 October 2012 NSW Police made a formal request for his extradition. He was arrested in August 2013. He waived his right to contest the extradition. He returned to Australia and on 4 August 2013 appeared before the Parramatta Local Court where he was granted conditional bail. He waived his right to a committal proceeding, and was formally committed for trial to the District Court. On 4 October 2013 he was arraigned in that court, and a trial was fixed to commence on 3 March 2014. On that date the trial was vacated. The reason or reasons for that do not appear in the materials before this Court. A new trial date was fixed, for 4 August 2014.
	
	
	On that date, the respondent was again arraigned in the District Court and entered a plea of not guilty. A Crown Case Statement was provided to the trial judge. After an outline of the facts asserted by the Crown, and under the heading “Basis for Manslaughter” the following was stated:
	


“26.  The Crown case is one of manslaughter by criminal negligence by omission.

Duty of care

27.  The accused was the deceased’s employer. This relationship gives rise to the accused owing the deceased a legal duty of care.”

The document went on to set out what the Crown contended was the content and standard of care (to take reasonable care to avoid exposing Mr Hands to an unnecessary risk of injury), and the breach of duty (the omission to stabilise the kitchen wall).


	
	Before the jury was empanelled, an application was made on behalf of the respondent for a stay of proceedings, apparently (other than the transcript, the relevant material was not before this Court) on the basis of the loss or destruction of evidentiary material, including transcript of proceedings in the Local Court (the committal proceedings of Mr Didio, which culminated in his discharge) and some exhibits. The application for stay was refused.
	
	
	In support of the stay application, a bundle of evidentiary material was tendered. This included the Crown Case Statement, the Bricklayers’ Safety Plan, the WorkCover interview with the respondent, some witness statements and photographs, and the statement by the respondent. It is to be noted that this material was tendered for the purpose of the stay application. It did not purport to be the whole of the Crown case.
	
	
	Importantly, in the Crown Case Statement reference was made to certain expert evidence on which the Crown proposed to rely. Although the expert report was not included, some extracts from it were. There were statements of opinion to the effect that, without stabilisation, the kitchen wall was “very unstable”, subject to “a line of relative weakness” as a result of a damp-proof course, “extremely vulnerable to overturning from wind load”, and “in a very unstable equilibrium”.
	
	
	The stay having been refused, a jury was empanelled, and, after some introductory remarks by the trial judge, the Crown prosecutor commenced his opening. The opening included an assertion that Mr Hands was employed by KLA and not - as was stated in the Crown Case Statement - by the respondent). The Crown prosecutor did not proceed, at that point, to identify the basis on which it was said that the respondent owed Mr Hands a duty of care.
	
	
	Before the Crown opening was complete, an adjournment was taken, and the jury released for the day. The trial judge then raised a question concerning the capacity of the evidence proposed to be led in the Crown case to prove the first of the essential elements of the offence, the existence of a duty of care owed by the respondent to Mr Hands. This was because the Crown case now was that Mr Hands had been employed, not by the respondent, but by KLA.
	
	
	This prompted counsel for the respondent to make a further application, this time for a directed verdict of acquittal. He provided written submissions in support of the application. These were directed to, and challenged, the contention in the Crown Case Statement that the respondent was Mr Hands’ employer. If the respondent was not Mr Hands’ employer, then, the submission ran, he did not owe Mr Hands any relevant duty of care. Reliance was placed upon the decision of the High Court in Andar Transport Pty Ltd v Brambles Ltd [2004] HCA 28; 217 CLR 424 at [44]-[51] (see below).
	
	
	Argument took place on the following day, during which it became apparent that the trial could not proceed and the jury was discharged.
	
	
	On 6 August the Crown prosecutor provided written and oral submissions in response to those of the respondent. The written submissions contained the following:
	


“Conclusion

16.  The Crown submits that the accused as the sole director owed the deceased as a company employee a duty of care. This is despite the lack of a formal employment relationship. The act of [sic - or] omission of the accused falls with negligence. He failed to take steps to brace the wall when it was or ought to have been obvious to him that this created a dangerous situation …

17.  The accused owed the deceased a duty of care. He was a ‘neighbour’ of the deceased whom he ought reasonably to have had in contemplation when he failed to brace the wall. The deceased was working in and around the wall while the accused was present. The risk of injury to him was foreseeable.

18.  There was a duty of care that rested upon the accused as the person in control of the company’s business and undertaking (the wall) to render the wall reasonably safe for the deceased. He was in breach of that duty of care when he failed to rectify the dangerous situation which he saw or ought to have seen and which could have been alleviated.” (italics added)


	
	It will be seen that there was a subtle - subtle, perhaps, but important - shift in the position taken by the Crown. The Crown maintained the position it had adopted in the opening, that it was KLA, and not the respondent, who was Mr Hands’ employer, and who therefore had the duty of an employer to take reasonable care for his safety. It now claimed that a duty of care on the respondent arose in three ways: first, his position as director of KLA imposed upon him a relevant duty of care; second, that, on fundamental principles of the law of negligence, the respondent (as a “neighbour”) owed Mr Hands a duty of care; third, that “as the person in charge” of KLA’s undertaking, he was under a duty of care.
	
	
	Earlier in the submissions, under the heading “Duty of Care”, the Crown prosecutor had referred to the foundational case in the law of negligence: Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562.
	


The judgment


	
	After hearing further argument, the trial judge delivered judgment. He recorded the changing position of the Crown as follows:
	


“The Crown originally propounded its case on the basis that the only source of the duty that the accused was alleged to have breached in a way so serious as to attract criminal liability resided in the relationship of employer and employee. No other facts were relied upon as giving rise to a duty of care by the accused to the deceased, much less any obligation to act so as to found liability in respect of an omission (Jt p 5, AB 11)

…

The Crown case, as now reformulated, asserts that the accused owed a duty of care to the deceased which was, for all relevant intents and purposes, co-extensive with the company’s obligations. That assertion necessarily involves the proposition that whatever the full scope of its content, the duty allegedly personally owed by the accused to the deceased included a legal obligation to act, so as to found liability for the omission relied upon, that is, the failure to ensure that the wall was left standing with adequate lateral support or bracing.” (Jt p 9-10, AB 15-16)

He rejected the first proposition, relying on the decision of the High Court in Andar.


	
	His Honour reviewed the evidence and the competing positions of the parties, and concluded:
	


“At one level, I think many of the considerations relied upon by the Crown, particularly when taken together with such additional of the salient features outlined by the President in Stavar as have sensible application on the facts of this case, create an arguable case for concluding that the accused owed a personal duty to the deceased sufficient to found the present charge …”

The reference to “the President in Stavar” was a reference to the judgment of Allsop P (as his Honour then was) in Caltex Refineries (QLD) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258; 75 NSWLR 649, which has been mentioned above. The judge then made reference to a Canadian decision (Berger v Willowdale AMC (1983) 145 DLR (3rd) 247) and said:

“Certainly Berger too stands as some support for recognition of an obligation to act in circumstances analogous to present, albeit in the civil sphere. However, there is no case binding upon me which has been brought to my attention which recognises the duty in an individual director which is coextensive with the duty of an employer corporation to its employees. Furthermore, the authorities, particularly Andar and Burns seem to me to reflect fundamental principles which favour a more cautionary approach in the circumstances.”


	
	Having balanced these competing considerations, he concluded:
	


“On balance, I have concluded that the evaluative exercise that I am bound to undertake favours the conclusion that the accused did not personally owe a duty to the deceased.”

He identified two “factors or features” that were “salient” and weighed “heavily in the balance against” other factors that might reasonably be thought to point strongly towards the existence of a personal duty in the respondent. The two factors were:

(i)  certain provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW) (“the OH&S Act”), as in force at the time of the death of Mr Hands; and

(ii)  that:

“… through the principles of accessorial liability the law already provides the means by which the accused might conceivably be held accountable for breaches by KLA of any duties it owed or crimes it committed.”

The provisions of the OH&S Act that influenced his Honour were s 8, which obliged an employer, so far as reasonably practicable, to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all employees, and went on to specify that the duty extended, inter alia, to ensuring the safety of premises at which employees worked; and s 26, which required officers of corporations to ensure that the corporations complied with their duties and obligations.


	
	His Honour therefore held that there was:
	


“… no warrant to impute a duty on the accused personally to act positively to ensure the safety of the deceased, where that imputation so far as the law in this State is concerned would appear to be novel.”


	
	He concluded:
	


“… there is no common law duty on the accused which relevantly founds his liability as a principal in respect of the offence charged.”

Accordingly, he ordered that the indictment be permanently stayed.


	
	The Director then filed the present appeal.
	


The Crown’s evolving position


	
	From the time the issue was raised by the trial judge during the course of the Crown’s opening to the jury, it was recognised by all that the critical issue concerned whether, on the Crown case taken at its highest, it could be said that the respondent owed Mr Hands a duty of care, and, if so, what was the content of that duty. On this question, as set out above, the Crown position varied from time to time. It was, initially, (as stated in the Crown Case Statement) that the respondent was the employer of Mr Hands and owed him the duty of care that all employers owe to employees.
	
	
	The Crown retreated from that position, and sought to advance a case based on the proposition that the respondent’s relationship to Mr Hands was analogous to that of an employer, and, as the trial judge put it, was “for all relevant intents and purposes, coextensive with the company’s obligations” (AB 15).
	
	
	There was also mention - not pursued - of a claim that the respondent owed Mr Hands a duty based on “the neighbour principle” stated in Donoghue v Stevenson.
	
	
	On appeal, the Director has adopted a third position (see below).
	
	
	In reciting this history, I do not intend any criticism of those involved. These are conceptually difficult issues, largely unexplored previously, and the question arose somewhat unexpectedly, by the intervention of the trial judge. No truly clear picture of what is required, or sufficient, to prove manslaughter by criminal negligence emerges from the authorities. But the history does have some significance, in my opinion, to the ultimate outcome of the appeal.
	


The appeal


	
	On appeal, the Crown proposed three alternative bases upon which the respondent could be held to have been under a relevant duty of care to Mr Hands. They are:
	


(i)  the respondent was under a statutory duty (imposed by s 20 of the OH&S Act, now repealed, but in force in 2003), to Mr Hands to take reasonable care for his health and safety;

(ii)  the respondent was under a common law duty to Mr Hands to take reasonable care for his safety (by reason of his direct involvement in the construction of the wall - see Evans (Gemma), Burns);

(iii)  the respondent was under a duty, by reason of some “novel duty of care” to take reasonable care for Mr Hands’ safety (see Stavar).

Duty of care


	
	Before considering each of these sequentially, I make some general observations, some of which are repetitive of what I have said above. It will be recalled that whether a duty exists is one of law, to be decided by the judge. However, the answer to the question will, if not always, then frequently, depend upon factual findings that lie within the province of the jury. It is not sufficient to conclude that, by reason of the nature of their relationship, person A owes person B a duty of care. Even if, as in the case of doctor and patient, parent and child, or many others (including employer and employee) it can be said with certainty that a duty of care exists, the critical question is what is encompassed in the duty of care. Reverting to [97] of Burns, the question is whether the duty extends to a duty to do the act, omission of which causes death. Even in civil cases, that question will be answered by reference to evidence, sometimes of an expert character.
	
	
	In this case, it seems to me, the trial judge was significantly influenced by the decision in Andar. Andar can be misunderstood, or at least taken to convey more than it in fact stands for. The common law duty with which that case was concerned was the duty to provide a safe system of work. In that context, the plurality said:
	


“44  Unlike the statutory duties construed in Ginty [[1959] 1 All ER 414] and its successors, the common law duty to take reasonable care for the safety of employees is imposed solely upon an employer. No equivalent duty was imposed upon Mr Wail [the injured plaintiff] in his capacity as employee. In such circumstances, questions such as ‘Whose fault was it?’ are apt to mislead. This is because any breach of duty committed by Andar [the employer] was inherently different in scope and effect from any negligence of Mr Wail at the time of the accident. It must follow that the requirement of co-extensiveness necessary in order to take advantage of the reasoning evident in cases such as Ginty did not exist in the present case. In Nicol [(1987) 163 CLR 611], in a passage with which we agree, Dawson J said [at 625]:

‘[I]t does not seem to me that the duty of an employer and an employee in such regard can ever be co-extensive or co-terminous. The duty is that of the employer and even if the employee is entrusted with its performance it remains an independent obligation of the employer of a more comprehensive kind to ensure that reasonable care is taken.’”


	
	In both Andar and Nicol v Allyacht Spars Pty Ltd (1987) 163 CLR 611, the injured employee was a director of the employer company. In each case the injury resulted from an unsafe system of work. Nevertheless, in each case, the High Court perceived (at least by implication) or did not exclude, a duty in the director, not as director, but as employee.
	
	
	It has long been recognised, in the civil law, that one employee might be liable to another for injury resulting from a casual act of negligence, as distinct from injury resulting from an unsafe system of work, as to which the employer has a non-delegable duty. Liability for casual acts of negligence is consistent with what I have called the foundational case, Donoghue v Stevenson. It is that which has given rise to the doctrine of vicarious liability, by which an employer may be held to account for a casual act of negligence on the part of one employee that resulted in injury to another. The clear implication is that the employee responsible for the injury does have that liability, arising out of a duty of care in accordance with “the neighbour principle” stated in Donoghue v Stevenson.
	
	
	This is to say no more than that the mere fact that KLA, as employer, owed a duty of care to Mr Hands to provide a safe system of work did not have the corollary that the respondent could not also owe Mr Hands a duty of care. Whether he did, and if so, what it entailed, will hinge upon the factual circumstances, not all of which were known at the time of the decision, and which were to be the subject of determination by a jury.
	


(i)  a statutory duty?


	
	The sole basis upon which the Crown relied to establish that the respondent was under a relevant statutory duty to Mr Hands was s 20 of the OH&S Act. That section provided as follows:
	


“20 Duties of employees

(1)  An employee must, while at work, take reasonable care for the health and safety of people who are at the employee’s place of work and who may be affected by the employee’s acts or omissions at work.

(2)  An employee must, while at work, co-operate with his or her employer or other person so far as is reasonably necessary to enable compliance with any requirement under this Act or the regulations that is imposed in the interests of health, safety and welfare on the employer or any other person.”

The suffix to the section, prescribing maximum penalties, made it plain that breach of the duty so imposed constituted a criminal offence, punishable by a monetary penalty.


	
	The respondent’s first answer to the Crown’s proposition that, by reason of s 20 of the OH&S Act, he was under a relevant duty to Mr Hands was that “s 20 is a statutory penalty provision … limited to its terms …” [at par 14] and [at par 23]:
	


“It does not in any event create a duty as such but rather defines the terms of a duty that otherwise exists by reference to which an alleged breach could support a prosecution pursuant to the Act for the limited penalties provided therein.”


	
	The respondent then proceeded to identify certain further provisions of the OH&S Act (one of which was enacted after the relevant events) which, he argued, pointed to a conclusion that the legislature did not intend s 20 to provide the basis for a prosecution for negligent manslaughter. The specific provisions identified were s 8 (specifying duties of employers); s 26 (extending criminal liability for corporate contraventions to directors and managers); s 107 (imposing time limits for prosecutions of offences under the OH&S Act). The later enacted provision was s 32A (creating an offence of reckless conduct causing death). Finally, the respondent pointed to s 42 of the Road Transport (Safety and Management) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Road Transport Act”) (also now repealed) by way of analogy.
	
	
	Put briefly, the arguments so put were as follows.
	
	
	Section 8(1) of the OH&S Act expressly imposed on employers a duty to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all employees. Section 26(1) made directors and managers of corporations criminally liable for contraventions by a corporation of any provision of the OH&S Act or Regulations (subject to a statutory defence, not here relevant). Relevantly, therefore, for present purposes, if KLA failed to ensure the health, safety or welfare at work of Mr Hands, then, as a director (and, possibly, manager) of KLA, the respondent could, under s 26, have been prosecuted in respect of that contravention.
	
	
	The respondent’s purpose in relying on these provisions was stated as follows:
	


“So far as ss 8 and 26 are concerned, it is submitted that s 8 places a much higher standard of care than the common law standard of care, and to the extent that the respondent owed such a duty as an employer (which is denied), then it is not the appropriate standard by which to measure the conduct constituting ‘such a great falling short’ of the standard.”

It will be appreciated that the last clause is a reference to the principles stated in Nydam.


	
	Section 107 prescribed a time limit (subject to a presently irrelevant exception) of 2 years for the prosecution of offences against the OH&S Act (including s 20). The respondent argued that it is not open to the Crown to seek to found a charge of manslaughter on any alleged breach of the duty imposed by s 20, prosecution for which is subject to a 2 year time limit.
	
	
	Section 32A was introduced into the OH&S Act with effect from 15 June 2005. It created, apparently for the first time, an offence of reckless conduct causing death at a workplace by a person who was, by reason of any provision of Pt 2 of the OH&S Act (which includes s 20) under a duty with respect to the health or safety of the person whose death was caused. A maximum penalty (with respect to an individual) of a fine, or imprisonment for 5 years, was prescribed.
	
	
	The respondent sought to make two points arising out of s 32A. The first was that, to sustain a prosecution under the section, it was necessary that the Crown prove that the conduct was “reckless” - and that that is conduct that is more serious than the “negligent” conduct relevant to a prosecution for negligent manslaughter. Yet the maximum penalty for an offence under s 32A was imprisonment for 5 years, contrasted with the 25 year maximum that is prescribed in respect of the offence of manslaughter (Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 24). The second point sought to be made was that the enactment of s 32A was an indication that Parliament had not intended breaches of the s 20 duty to give rise to prosecutions for manslaughter.
	
	
	Finally, by analogy, the respondent pointed to s 42(1)(a) of the Road Transport Act. Section 42(1)(a) created an offence of negligent driving causing death, and prescribed a maximum penalty of (for a first offence) imprisonment for 18 months and (in the case of a second or subsequent offence) imprisonment for 2 years (in each case, together with a fine).
	
	
	The purpose of this exercise was to found a submission that the provision “could not of itself be used as a mechanism to constitute a prosecution for criminal negligence manslaughter”. It was submitted that “such a penalty section again does not create a duty”.
	


Resolution


	
	The respondent’s propositions can be disposed of serially.
	
	
	Just what is meant by saying that s 20 was merely a “statutory penalty provision” that does not impose a duty is quite unclear to me. In plain language, the section did impose a duty. The duty was placed on employees to take reasonable care for the health and safety of others (including other employees) who were at their place of work, and who may have been affected by the act or omission (sub-s (1)); and to cooperate with the employer to enable compliance with legislative requirements imposed in the interests of health, safety and welfare.
	
	
	The argument that s 8 imposes a higher standard of care than the common law standard (which is to take reasonable care for the safety of employees) may be correct, but is quite immaterial to whether a duty of care exists. The respondent’s argument in this respect in par 30 will be more appropriately directed to the fifth element of the offence of negligent manslaughter, an element which is not in issue in this appeal.
	
	
	The argument based on s 107 is likewise immaterial. Section 107 imposed a time limit on prosecutions under (inter alia) s 20. It did not have the effect of nullifying the duty of care that was imposed by that section. Nor did s 107 (or s 20, or s 26) exclude reliance by the Crown on the same conduct as evidence of a more serious criminal offence than contravention of s 20 (whether within or outside the 2 year limitation period).
	
	
	Section 32A is also irrelevant. That the legislature subsequently enacted legislation creating a specific offence says nothing about whether the same conduct might, prior to (or after) the enactment constitute a different criminal offence. That, also, is the answer to the respondent’s argument by analogy with s 42 of the Road Transport Act.
	
	
	Underlying the respondent’s argument is a hidden, and false, premise. The premise is that, because the respondent could (within 2 years) have been prosecuted under s 20, the conduct that could have given rise to such a prosecution was unavailable for any other purpose of the criminal law. The argument does not depend upon the statutory time limit. If correct, it would also have operated to prevent prosecution of the respondent for manslaughter within the 2 year period. In other words, the creation of an offence of breach of the duty imposed by s 20 precluded prosecution for any other offence arising out of the same conduct, no matter how serious.
	
	
	As I have said, the premise is false.
	
	
	It is not unusual, in the criminal law, for the same conduct to be capable of giving rise to a number of different charges. Frequently, the charge selected will depend upon the consequences of the conduct. Driving whilst there is present in the blood the prescribed concentration of alcohol is one example. At its lowest level, it resulted in a charge under s 110(3) of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW), carrying only a monetary penalty. At its worst, where death results, it may constitute an offence against s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years or, where committed in circumstances of aggravation, 14 years.
	
	
	Section 42(2) of the Road Transport Act also created an offence of furious, reckless or dangerous driving, carrying a maximum penalty (for a first offence) of imprisonment for 9 months, or (in the case of a second or subsequent offence) of imprisonment for 12 months. Where death or grievous bodily harm resulted, however, a charge was also available under s 52A of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	I return to s 20. By way of example, the following may be considered. An employee at a workplace assaults another, causing actual bodily harm. At the lowest level, that conduct is a contravention of s 20, and could, within the 2 year limitation period, have been prosecuted under that section. That that is so did not have the effect that it could not have been prosecuted under s 59 of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. If the assault was committed with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and resulted in such harm, or in wounding, it could be prosecuted under s 33 of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years.
	
	
	Similarly, if the assault caused the death of the employee, there is no reason to suppose that the perpetrator could not have been charged with manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. There is a range of other offences that could be constituted by the same conduct.
	
	
	Once that is recognised, it can be seen that the time limit imposed by s 107 is a distraction. The issue is not whether, outside that time limit, the respondent might have been charged with a more serious offence than that created by s 20. It is not the offence created by s 20 that gives rise to the charge of manslaughter. It is the duty that is imposed by that section that founds the prosecution for manslaughter, by reason of its alleged breach, and its alleged consequences.
	
	
	The issue for present determination is limited. It is whether, on the Crown evidence as it is understood (on the basis of the Crown Case Statement and materials referred to above) the respondent was under a statutory duty of care to Mr Hands, and, more specifically, whether that duty required him to take steps to brace the wall. The first question, in my opinion, is easily answered. By s 20, he was under a duty of care to Mr Hands. The second question is not so readily answered. That is because the answer will depend upon facts not yet established, and not known - specifically, facts which will emerge from expert evidence concerning the degree (if any) of danger posed by leaving the wall unstabilised, and the measures available to take precautions against that danger. There may be others. Whatever they are, it is the role of the jury to find the facts upon which the existence of the duty depends.
	
	
	It follows from the above that, as to whether the Crown can establish that the respondent was under a relevant duty to Mr Hands (to act in a particular way by bracing the wall) I differ from the Chief Justice in a number of respects.
	
	
	First, in my opinion, the Court is not in a position definitively to say whether or not such a duty existed. Second, the issue does not depend upon other provisions of the OH&S Act. Specifically, it does not depend upon powers and duties given to inspectors of WorkCover, nor the abrogation of the privilege (or right) against self-incrimination (although those matters might give rise to weighty evidentiary debates). Third, I do not agree ([95]) that to allow the prosecution to proceed would potentially enlarge the circumstances in which the crime of manslaughter could be committed. Once duty is established (if it is established) then the principles of negligent manslaughter outlined above will apply. Fourth, I do not agree that s 32A of the OH&S Act has any bearing on the question. So much follows from my reasoning above.
	


(ii)  a common law duty of care?


	
	The Crown position in respect of a common law duty of care depended upon the evidence of the respondent’s involvement in building the kitchen wall, and his role as the person in charge of the bricklaying activities on the site. Effectively, he was responsible for the supervision of the bricklaying work, and, particularly for decision making in that respect.
	
	
	The Crown submission, as expressed in Ground 2 of the grounds of appeal, was that:
	


“… there was a common law duty of care which arose because the Respondent had played a direct central causative part in the sequence of events which gave rise to the risk that the wall might collapse, which the Respondent owed to the Deceased and which could found liability for the offence of manslaughter by reason of criminal negligence.”


	
	For the purpose of analysis of this basis of asserted criminal liability, it is necessary to examine more closely the reasoning in Burns. The essential facts in Burns were that the appellant had supplied a prohibited drug (methadone) to a David Hay. Mr Hay consumed the methadone in the home of the appellant and her husband. (Although, at trial, the Crown contended that the appellant, or her husband, with whom she was acting in concert, had injected Mr Hay with the drug, or assisted him to inject the drug, and the Court of Criminal Appeal concluded that that had occurred, the High Court rejected that proposition and held that the evidence was not capable of supporting such a conclusion (the plurality at [91]-[94], the Chief Justice agreeing at [47]).
	
	
	In the High Court, therefore, the decision proceeded on the basis that the appellant (and/or her husband) had supplied the drug to Mr Hay who administered it to himself. Having used the methadone, Mr Hay suffered an adverse reaction whilst still in the home of the appellant and her husband. After some futile attempts to activate Mr Hay, Mr Burns proposed calling an ambulance, a suggestion that Mr Hay rejected. Mr Hay then left the premises. He died a short distance away.
	
	
	The High Court considered the question of manslaughter, both by unlawful and dangerous act, and by criminal negligence. As to the latter, both the Chief Justice and the plurality generally accepted the authorities from the United Kingdom, to the effect that a duty of care may arise “where a defendant has played a causative part in the sequence of events which have given rise to the risk of injury, such that a duty to take reasonable steps to avert or lessen the risk may arise” (French CJ, at [23]).
	
	
	The Crown’s essential proposition is derived, first, from the judgment in Evans (Gemma) adopting principles stated in Mitchell v Glasgow City Council [2009] 1 AC 874. In Evans (Gemma), the Court of Appeal said:
	


“17  … In a variety of circumstances what may appear to be an omission to act may be converted into ‘a breach of a legal duty to take reasonable steps to safeguard, or to try to safeguard … from harm or injury’.”


	
	The words in quotation marks were drawn from the speech of Lord Scott of Foscote in Mitchell (in which the House of Lords in Scotland had under consideration the existence of a duty of care said to give rise to civil liability). His Lordship said:
	


“The requisite additional feature that transforms what would otherwise be a mere omission, a breach at most of a moral obligation, into a breach of a legal duty to take reasonable steps to safeguard, or to try to safeguard, the person in question from harm or injury may take a wide variety of forms. Sometimes the additional feature may be found in the manner in which the victim came to be at risk of harm or injury. If a defendant has played some causative part in the train of events that have led to the risk of injury, a duty to take reasonable steps to avert or lessen the risk may arise. Sometimes the additional feature may be found in the relationship between the victim and the defendant: (eg employee/employer or child/parent) … Sometimes the additional feature may be found in the assumption by the defendant of responsibility for the person at risk of injury … In each case where particular circumstances are relied on as constituting the requisite additional feature alleged to be sufficient to cast upon the defendant the duty to take steps that, if taken, would or might have avoided or lessened the injury to the victim, the question for the court will be whether the circumstances were indeed sufficient for that purpose or whether the case remains one of mere omission.” (internal citations omitted)


	
	Adopting those observations for the purpose of criminal liability for an omission, at [31] in Evans (Gemma), the Court of Appeal said:
	


“In our judgment … for the purposes of gross negligence manslaughter, when a person has created or contributed to the creation of a state of affairs which he knows, or ought reasonably to know, has become life threatening, a consequent duty on him to act by taking reasonable steps to save the other's life will normally arise.”


	
	The passage was adopted by French CJ in Burns, who said, at [23]:
	


“23  A duty of care may also arise where a defendant has played a causative part in the sequence of events which have given rise to the risk of injury, such that ‘a duty to take reasonable steps to avert or lessen the risk may arise.’”

and by the plurality at [102]-[107].


	
	The facts in Evans (Gemma) bore considerable similarities to Burns, in that the appellant (and her mother) had supplied a drug (heroin) to the appellant’s younger half-sister, Carly, who self-injected. Carly suffered an adverse reaction, recognisable to the appellant as consistent with overdose, but the appellant took no action to seek medical attention. Importantly, both the appellant and her mother believed that they were responsible for Carly’s care.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the factual parallels between Burns and Evans (Gemma), the cases had different outcomes. In Evans (Gemma), the Court of Appeal concluded that the appellant was “under a plain and obvious duty to take reasonable steps to assist or provide assistance for Carly”, which she failed to do. A contrary conclusion was reached in Burns.
	
	
	The distinguishing feature in Burns appears to have been the absence of any relationship that gave rise to a duty of care. The mere fact that the appellant had supplied Mr Hay with the drug (in circumstances where the evidence did not exclude self-administration) and in circumstances where the evidence was that he had “rebuffed” the offer to call an ambulance, did not create a duty of care; in those circumstances, the appellant had not created the danger to which Mr Hay was exposed - it was Mr Hay himself who had done so by injecting the drug: per French CJ, [48], the plurality at [105].
	
	
	It will be seen that there is a fine line distinguishing the two cases, each of which was ultimately decided on its own facts. For present purposes, the importance of both cases is the recognition that a duty to act so as to prevent or reduce the danger of injury or death might be attributed where the need for action is caused by the conduct of the accused person. In Evans (Gemma) the supply of heroin was accepted as the conduct that created the need for action; the duty arose because the appellant and her mother had acknowledged their responsibility for the care of Carly. In Burns, a different result was reached because Mr Hay, for whom the appellant had no responsibility other than any that emerged from her supply to him of methadone, had, by using the drug, himself created the danger.
	
	
	The decision in Evans (Gemma) also drew upon an earlier decision of the House of Lords: R v Miller [1983] 2 AC 161; 2 WLR 539. Mr Miller lived in a “squat”. He lit a cigarette, and fell asleep. He woke to find that his mattress was smouldering. He left the room and went back to sleep in an adjoining room. He did nothing about the smouldering mattress. The house caught fire. Mr Miller was convicted of arson. Again, the obligation to act to avert a danger created by himself provided the basis of the decision that he was criminally liable for the omission.
	
	
	The respondent sought to distinguish Miller by pointing out Mr Miller had initially taken all the steps that caused the danger of fire, and then failed to take the necessary steps to avert the danger. By contrast, on the Crown case against the respondent, it was Mr Hands who solely built the wall, and then, on his own initiative, put himself in its vicinity just before its collapse.
	


Resolution


	
	The respondent’s argument overlooks the important circumstance that, on the evidence, Mr Hands constructed the wall under the direction of the respondent, and that the respondent was responsible for decisions concerning the wall.
	
	
	Returning to the various “additional features” mentioned in Mitchell as potentially giving rise to a duty of care, it may be seen that several are here applicable. These are:
	



	
	the manner in which Mr Hands came to be injured;
	
	
	the respondent’s causative part in the train of events that led to the risk of injury;
	
	
	the relationship of employee/employer (although the respondent was not, in strict law, Mr Hands’ employer, he nevertheless stood in a quasi-employer position – as mentioned above, Andar, while affirming that the duty to provide a safe system of work lies on the employer, and is non-delegable, does not exclude the liability of others for casual acts of negligence).
	



	
	Moreover, it is to be restated that the present question is confined to whether, on the Crown case as it is presently understood, the respondent was under a duty of care to Mr Hands, and, if so, whether that duty extended to ensuring that the wall was stabilised. Both parts of the question, but more particularly the latter, will depend upon findings of fact that the jury must make - findings that include analysis of the proposed expert evidence.
	
	
	On the appeal, the Crown did not argue for a duty of care on the more general principles stated in Donoghue v Stevenson. It would therefore be inappropriate to reach any final conclusion in that respect. However, having regard to what I have said above, such an approach could not be excluded.
	
	
	For the reasons given above, it is not open to doubt that, at least in some circumstances, co-employees may owe to one another duties of care on Donoghue v Stevenson principles. The key is, first, to identify the circumstances of the employment relationship that can be said to give rise to such a duty; and, second, where it is held that a duty exists, to ascertain the content of that duty.
	
	
	On the evidence available in this case, I would have no hesitation in concluding that the respondent, in his capacity as a co-employee, owed Mr Hands a duty of care. Two circumstances that give to that conclusion are:
	


(i)  his authority over the manner in which Mr Hands performed his work;

(ii)  his decision-making role with respect to, inter alia, whether the wall was to be braced.


	
	The far more difficult question is whether the duty extended to requiring the wall to be braced. No conclusion can be reached as to that in the absence of necessary factual findings, which will very likely depend upon the expert evidence.
	
	
	In this respect, I agree with what the Chief Justice has said at [112]-[117], and [121].
	


(iii)  a novel duty of care?


	
	Although the Crown relied on the “salient features” approach to determining whether a “novel duty of care” exists as set out in the judgment of Allsop P in Stavar, it made no attempt to identify what that novel duty was, or how it travelled beyond the common law principles to which I have referred.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the circumspection urged by the High Court in Burns (at [107]), in expanding the foundations for the existence of a duty of care giving rise to criminal liability, I would reject this ground.
	


Orders


	
	The Director has succeeded in establishing that the decision to order a stay of proceedings was flawed in fundamental respects. The question then arises as to what orders ought to be made by this Court. Ordinarily, the Director’s success would result in the setting aside of the order; whether the matter is to proceed to trial is for the determination of the Director. This Court should be slow to interfere with that process.
	
	
	The doctrine of separation of powers has an important role to play in the administration of criminal justice. Ordinarily, a decision to prosecute for an offence lies exclusively within the area of jurisdiction of the executive branch of government: Barton v The Queen [1980] HCA 48; 147 CLR 75 at 91 (but see also at 94, 96 and 107); Maxwell v The Queen [1996] HCA 46; 184 CLR 501; Likiardopoulos v The Queen [2012] HCA 37; 247 CLR 265 at [2]-[3] and [37] ff; R v Peters and Heffernan (1995) 83 A Crim R 142.
	
	
	Occasionally, that principle comes into collision with the necessity for the judicial branch of government to act to protect its processes against misuse. A real question arises in the present case as to whether, if this prosecution is allowed to proceed, it would constitute misuse of the processes of the court.
	
	
	It is for this reason that I have set out at some length the procedural history of this matter. The events in question occurred in 2003. No action was taken to charge the respondent until the warrant for his arrest was issued in December 2005. He has been prepared for trial twice. It was not until this appeal that the Crown case achieved its final formulation. This decision is not about whether a stay should be granted. It is about whether the discretion of this Court under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act should be exercised in favour of the Director, or in favour of the respondent. Fairness to the accused person is one of the relevant considerations. The Chief Justice has, at [123]-[130] set out a number of other considerations.
	
	
	On balance, I have concluded that, notwithstanding that the Director has established that the decision to order a stay of the prosecution was erroneous at the time it was made, the appeal should be dismissed. I appreciate that this was not the subject of argument and the parties have not had an opportunity to be heard on the question.
	
	
	Ordinarily, this would call for an opportunity to be afforded to the parties to put submissions as to the outcome of the appeal. However, the Chief Justice and Bellew J take a different view, and there have been long delays in this matter already, not least because of the complexity of the issues. Recognising, and notwithstanding that the Director may have had contrary submissions to put, and because this is a minority view, I would dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the judgments of the Chief Justice and Simpson JA. The facts are set out at length in each of those judgments and in these circumstances I will not recite them again.
	
	
	It will be apparent from their Honours’ observations that the primary issue in the present case is whether there exists a proper basis upon which the respondent could be held to have owed a duty of care to the deceased. The Crown has submitted that such a duty arises on one or other of the following bases:
	



	
	a duty imposed pursuant to s. 20(1) and/or (2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW) (“the OH&S duty”)
	
	
	a duty at common law (“the common law duty”); and
	
	
	a novel duty to take reasonable care for the safety of the deceased (“the novel duty”).
	


The OH&S Duty


	
	The provisions of s. 20, which are set in the judgment of the Chief Justice at [84], do not appear to have been drawn to the attention of the primary judge. The Crown submitted that each of ss. 20(1) and (2) imposed a statutory duty upon the respondent as an employee. That much is clear. However, the effect of the Crown’s submission was that this circumstance inevitably led to the conclusion that a contravention of either duty was capable of giving rise to liability on the part of the respondent for manslaughter.
	
	
	In my view, that approach over simplifies the matter somewhat, and fails to consider whether the Parliament intended that this be the case. The Chief Justice has made reference (at [90]-[94]) to a number of provisions of the OH&S Act. I agree with the Chief Justice, for the reasons he has expressed, that those matters run contrary to a conclusion that the Parliament so intended. In particular in my view, there is nothing in the language of the statute which reflects such an intention.
	
	
	The Chief Justice has also made reference, commencing at [95], to the subsequent enactment of s. 32A as a circumstance supporting such a conclusion. Even allowing for the cautious approach which must be taken in using amending legislation in this way (to which the Chief Justice referred at [99]), in my view the enactment of s. 32A would not have been necessary had the Parliament intended, in enacting s. 20, to enlarge the circumstances in which the crime of manslaughter could be committed.
	
	
	For these reasons I agree with the Chief Justice in respect of the first ground.
	


The common law duty


	
	Simpson JA has made reference to judgment of French CJ in Burns (at [23]) as well as the judgment of the plurality in that case (at [102]-[107]). Her Honour has also made reference to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Evans (Gemma) (at 317). Those decisions postulate particular circumstances in which a duty of care may arise. Those circumstances include where a defendant has played a causative role in the sequence of events which have given rise to a risk of injury. The Crown argued that in the context of the present case, the relevant risk was a risk of collapse of the wall.
	
	
	The Chief Justice has set out (commencing at [110]) a number of factors which may render it open to a jury to conclude that the respondent owed a duty of care to the deceased. I agree with the Chief Justice, for the reasons he has expressed, that those factors are capable of supporting such a conclusion.
	
	
	It follows that I agree with the Chief Justice and Simpson JA that the appeal should be allowed on the basis of the second ground.
	


The novel duty


	
	The Crown approached this issue by enumerating what were said to be various “salient features”, and submitting that such features gave rise to a duty of care. In my view, there are difficulties with that approach.
	
	
	Firstly, there was no attempt made to draw any appropriate distinctions between those features which are factual, those which require value judgments and those which may require the application of legal policy: Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258; 75 NSWLR 649 at [172] per Basten JA, Simpson J (as her Honour then was) agreeing. Further, and perhaps even more fundamentally, there was no clear articulation by the Crown of the nature and scope of the posited duty.
	
	
	For these reasons, I agree with Simpson JA that Ground 3 should be rejected.
	


Orders


	
	The remaining question is what orders are appropriate.
	
	
	The circumstances giving rise to this matter date back to 2003. Both the Chief Justice and Simpson JA have set out the procedural history, which includes the fact that some years elapsed before the respondent was charged. That history, along with necessity to act with fairness towards a defendant in criminal proceedings, provides some support for exercising the discretion to dismiss the appeal. That said, those factors must be balanced against a range of others, not the least of which are the seriousness of the allegations, and the equally serious consequences which flowed from the incident.
	
	
	In making these observations, I would prefer to express no view as to the strength or otherwise of the Crown case. On balance, having concluded that the decision of the primary judge was erroneous, I have come to the view that the order granting the stay should be quashed.
	
	
	I therefore agree with orders proposed by the Chief Justice.

2768505,Kramarzewski & El Ghoul v R [2015] NSWDC 400,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Stan Kramarzewski and Khaled El Ghoul appeal from sentences imposed on them by Magistrate Still sitting in the Local Court at Burwood on 4 November 2015. The learned Magistrate sentenced Mr Kramarzewski to imprisonment for 16 months and fixed a non-parole period of 10 months. That sentence was to commence on 4 November 2015, the day on which it was imposed. His Honour sentenced Mr El Ghoul to imprisonment for 18 months and fixed a non-parole period of 12 months. That sentence was due to commence on 4 November 2015 as well, the date on which the sentence was imposed. However, on the day the sentence was imposed each of the offenders filed a notice of appeal against the severity of sentence and was granted bail. Neither of the offenders has served any time in custody.
	
	
	The offences are objectively grave. However, there is a little difference in the facts agreed in each case. The two offenders were courier drivers working for StarTrack Express. That courier company had a contract with Brightstar Logistics to deliver mobile phone devices distributed on behalf of Telstra Corporation Limited. When a customer of Telstra makes an order for a telephone there is no requirement for the customer to make any payment. The customer’s application is assessed on the telephone and, provided the customer passes an initial credit assessment, a mobile telephone apparatus is dispatched to the customer’s nominated address within 48 hours. The customer of Telstra is required to provide some form of personal identification, typically a driver’s licence. The last four digits of the personal identification provided become a code which is printed on the outside of the delivery satchel. When the satchel is delivered to the customer, the customer is required to present the relevant identification and the courier driver must confirm that the code endorsed on the delivery satchel matches the last four digits of the identification provided by the customer who is supposed to be the person who ordered the telephone.
	
	
	When the mobile telephones’ are delivered by StarTrack Express they are dealt with under a procedural system described as “Airlock” that requires the customer of Telstra to hand to the StarTrack Express Courier driver the valid identification and the identification provided must match the name of the customer as placed on the order as well as the unique four digit code. The customer is required to sign the consignment note when the customer receives the product. If no person is present at the time the mobile phone is delivered it is not left at the customer’s address but a card is left with details of the consignment and the mobile phone is left at the nearest post office.
	
	
	The offending behaviour occurred between December 2013 and November 2014. A female, Kim Carpenter, was the principal organiser of a fraud in which the two offenders became involved. She herself was a Telstra customer. In the period in question she made various orders in different names to Telstra for mobile phones. She did this by using one mobile phone handset but different SIM cards. When she placed an order she provided a false name and particulars at an address somewhere in the general south west area of Sydney. The addresses were real but the name of the person given by Carpenter as the customer was not the person living at the address. In accordance with its normal procedure the handsets were dispatched within 48 hours of the order being made. When the mobile phones were dispatched they would be shipped by Brightstar Logistics to StarTrack Express which delivered them to the addresses provided by Carpenter to Telstra. Carpenter would contact one of the two offenders and advise him of the false name and address of the orders she had made. Records of those telephone calls have been identified. The offenders attended work each day and loaded their courier trucks with packages that they were asked to deliver. Those packages often contained mobile phone devices addressed to a bogus customer who in reality was Carpenter.
	
	
	Paragraphs 18 and 19 of the facts agreed between the Crown and Mr Kramarzewski are these:
	


“18. El Ghoul and Kramarzewski, once having started work and begun delivering other packages, will look for the package marked by Telstra and as having the false name and address on the delivery details.”

19. Once a package is located by either accused at the StarTrack Express depot at Greenacre, the item is then delivered to the nominated address and recipient on the consignment note. Carpenter would meet the accused at each address and sign for the package containing the mobile phone. On each occasion false identification was provided by Carpenter. El Ghoul and Kramarzewski would deliver up to ten mobile phones each to Carpenter on any given day meeting her at a different address on each occasion.”


	
	Paragraph 18 of the facts agreed between the Crown and Mr El Ghoul is this:
	


“Once a package is located by either accused at the StarTrack Express depot at Greenacre, the item is then delivered to the nominated address and recipient on the consignment note. Carpenter or other unknown men would meet the accused at each address and sign for the package containing the mobile phone. On each occasion false identification was provided. El Ghoul and Kramarzewski would deliver up to ten mobile phones each to Carpenter on any given day meeting her at a different address on each occasion.”

There is some tension between the last two sentences of those agreed facts. In his oral evidence today Mr El Ghoul told me that there were four men other than Ms Carpenter who accepted delivery of the mobile phone handsets but he was unable to identify any one of those men.


	
	The deliveries under this fraudulent scheme can be tabulated by giving the month and the number of devices and the value of the devices. That table is this:

	The total loss incurred by Telstra Corporation Limited was $833,947. The total loss to Telstra of the deliveries effected by Kramarzewski was $465,715. The total loss to Telstra as the result of deliveries made by El Ghoul was $313,384.
	
	
	The downturn in deliveries from June 2014 to November 2014 is explained by the fact that Mr Kramarzewski resigned from the employment of StarTrack Express in June 2014 after working for it for some 30 years. Mr El Ghoul continued to participate in the fraud until he was arrested at his place of employment on 16 December 2014.
	
	
	At the present time Mr Kramarzewski is 67 years old, Mr El Ghoul is 51 years old. Each of the offenders stood for sentence in the Local Court as a man of prior good character. Mr Kramarzewski had not committed any criminal offence at any time in the past and the only criminal antecedents of Mr El Ghoul were driving offences which are of no significance whatever.
	
	
	The extent of the fraud is large. The loss suffered by Telstra Corporation Limited is large. The potential amount of money gained by the principal in the fraud, Ms Carpenter, is substantial. The gain she made may well have been less than the total loss incurred by Telstra but it would have been substantial. The telephones which were the subject of fraud have been identified as being found in places such as New York, India, Russia, Kuwait, Argentina, as well as Australia.
	
	
	The real question for the Court’s consideration is: why did these two men of mature age and prior good character become involved in fraud? That really determines the extent of their criminality and therefore the nature of the penalty that ought be imposed.
	
	
	Mr Kramarzewski was born in Germany after his Polish parents fled the Communist advance in Eastern Europe at the end of World War II. Mr Kramarzewski and his parents arrived in Australia when he was two years old, that is, in probably 1950. His father is still living and is 88 years old. He lives one street away from the offender who really cares for his father who is reliant upon him for much in his old age. Mr Kramarzewski concluded his schooling at Ashfield Boys High School in what is now called Year 9, in those days it would have been 3rd Form. Whether he obtained his Intermediate Certificate or not the evidence does not disclose. He commenced a plumbing apprenticeship but lost that because his employer went out of business during a downturn. He then worked in a variety of jobs as a shop assistant, a sales representative for a chemical company, in a cake shop until the company was wound-up, and he then commenced working as a courier driver with a company called Alpha Couriers. He then worked for a discount freight company which changed its name in 2000 to StarTrack Express. As I said earlier, he worked for that company for 30 years prior to his leaving the business in June 2014. He has been married for some 46 years. He has three adult children and seven grandchildren.
	
	
	Mr Kramarzewski was interviewed by Mr Sam Borenstein, a psychologist, on 2 November 2015. He was given this history:
	


“Mr Kramarzewski initially met Kim Carpenter when he delivered a parcel and she was able to provide proper identification. Mr Kramarzewski subsequently delivered parcels (iPhones) to Kim Carpenter, who ‘gave me a sob story. I thought it was real. She told me she could not pay the rent and that her partner was a gambler, and she had three children to feed’.

Mr Kramarzewski describes himself as ‘a soft touch’. I’ve always been like that’. Mr Kramarzewski agreed with Ms Carpenter to deliver phones to assist her out financially. Mr Kramarzewski states he complied out of concern for Kim Carpenter, who he believed was suffering financially, about to be thrown out onto the streets and not able to feed her three children.

Mr Kramarzewski states his involvement spanned some six months. After a period of time, Mr Kramarzewski was paid moneys by Ms Carpenter, which he accepted. Over the six month period, Mr Kramarzewski states, ‘I felt bad, but I didn’t know how to get out of it. I was worried if I said no to her she would call my employer, so I resigned. Mr Kramarzewski had intended to work up to the age of 70, and resigned prematurely in June 2014.

Mr Kramarzewski’s history confirms he is a person who puts the needs and wants of others before [himself]. Mr Kramarzewski is currently acting as a carer for his father, who is struggling emotionally since the death of Mr Kramarzewski’s mother in 2010.

Mr Kramarzewski is actively involved in supporting his two daughters and son, and seven grandchildren.

Mr Kramarzewski reflects on the behaviour which brings him before the Court. Mr Kramarzewski states over the six month period representing his involvement in the offences, he felt burdened by guilt and uncertainty as to how to extricate himself.

Mr Kramarzewski impressed as genuinely burdened by guilt and remorse with regards [to] the offending behaviour. Mr Kramarzewski is now concerned about the welfare of his father and wife, in the event he is incarcerated. Mr Kramarzewski reflects on his foolishness, and the pattern of putting the needs and wants of others before self.

Mr Kramarzewski’s current diagnosis is that of mild to moderate adjustment disorder with anxiety as he faces the prospect of incarceration”.


	
	Nearly everyone who stands for sentence can be expected to be suffering from anxiety, depression and stress following upon the prospect of being sentenced to full-time imprisonment. The existence of an adjustment disorder in such circumstances is to be expected.
	
	
	Mr Kramarzewski has confirmed his contrition and remorse by agreeing to assist the authorities. He has assisted the authorities by nominating the principal organiser of the fraud, formally identifying her and giving the police evidence about matters of which they were unaware which will greatly assist police in prosecuting Kim Carpenter. He has given an undertaking to give oral evidence in court at the trial which she will undergo in 2016 in this Court. The police categorise the assistance given to them as “high”. They also say that the timeliness of the assistance and information given to them by Mr Kramarzewski has been timely and appropriate and indeed one detective sergeant tells me that without the assistance given by Mr Kramarzewski the prosecution of Kim Carpenter may not have been able to be progressed.
	
	
	The offender only received a small amount of money, money really of no significance, from Carpenter. He fell into her trap because he was trying to assist her in a mistaken belief that she was in need. When he realised what was happening he found it difficult to extricate himself and could only get out of it by resigning his job, something which he did not intend to do and which he has regretted. He told Mr Borenstein that he still misses the job that he had done for some 30 years. Whilst the sum in which the offender assisted Carpenter in defrauding the victim Telstra is substantial, nearly a half million dollars, the gain to the offender himself has been paltry and the detriment great. His criminality is low.
	
	
	I have no hesitation accepting, nor does the Crown, in finding that the offender will not reoffend. He has learnt by having his fingers burnt relatively late in his life, which has otherwise been one of a hardworking, honest, family-man in our community. However, the Court must recognise not only personal deterrence, that is, stopping this offender from committing another crime, but also general deterrence, making a statement about criminal behaviour that should deter others from falling into a similar or position, of getting themselves involved in criminal behaviour.
	
	
	The learned Magistrate started with a head sentence of 20 months imprisonment. He allowed 10% for a plea of guilty and a further 10% for the offender’s assistance to the police, and thereby reduced 20 months to 16 months and then sentenced the offender to imprisonment for 16 months and fixed a ten month non-parole period. I accept that a 20 month head sentence is an appropriate indicative sentence. However, I would allow a 20% discount for the utilitarian value of the offender’s plea of guilty.
	
	
	The first appearance before the Local Court was on 14 January 2015. There were six further appearances at that Court. However, by 3 June the Local Court noted that there were negotiations and eventually on 26 August 2015 the offender entered a plea of guilty which led to his being sentenced by Magistrate Still on 4 November 2015. Whilst it is not a plea at the earliest possible opportunity it is still a plea of guilty at a very early stage in proceedings. The matter had not been set down for a committal hearing. It is sometimes difficult to understand what is meant by endorsements on Local Court coversheets but it appears that no actual date for a committal hearing was set because no time estimate was ever provided for the length of the committal hearing. Accordingly, I accept that there was a plea before any committal hearing date was set which led to the offender standing for sentence in the Local Court on 4 November. I would accordingly allow a discount of 20% for a relatively early plea of guilty.
	
	
	The learned Magistrate assessed Mr Kramarzewski’s assistance at 10%, 5% for the past and 5% for the future. With the utmost respect to the learned Magistrate, I believe that that is a gross underestimate of the value of the offender’s assistance. I would allow a 20% discount for the offender’s assistance, allowing 10% for the past and 10% for the offender’s undertaking to give evidence in this Court against Kim Carpenter. Accordingly, a total discount of 40% ought to have been allowed and therefore the head sentence should be reduced to 12 months.
	
	
	The Crown has conceded that whilst a custodial sentence is called for it does not maintain the position that the custodial sentence must be a full time custodial sentence. Bearing in mind the relatively low criminality and the effect that this has had on the offender to-date, bearing in mind his true remorse and contrition and bearing in mind his age and antecedents, and his commitments, looking after his family, I believe that his is an appropriate case in which to suspend the sentence pursuant to s 12.
	
	
	I turn now to Mr El Ghoul appeal. The reasons for Mr El Ghoul’s being involved in this fraud are very different. In one respect it is difficult to accept the plausibility of the excuse offered by Mr El Ghoul for his becoming involved but there must have been cultural factors here at play and other factors have not been the subject of any challenge by the Crown.
	
	
	Like Mr Kramarzewski, Mr El Ghoul was examined by Mr Borenstein on 29 October 2015. Mr El Ghoul gave Mr Borenstein a history of two events happening on one day in late 2012, approximately one year prior to his becoming involved in the fraud now in question. The relevant history of Mr Borenstein is this:
	


“Whilst employed as a courier driver, Mr El Ghoul states he was subject to traumatic incidents, but could not nominate the date, “I remember it was a Thursday”. Mr El Ghoul states he was delivering a parcel and had difficulty finding the exact address. He recalls going into a medical practice, which did not correspond with the exact delivery address. Mr El Ghoul could only deliver items the person who could provide suitable identification, and if the parcel could not be delivered, Mr El Ghoul would take the parcel to the nearest post office. Mr El Ghoul says he returned to his van, intending to take that parcel to the post office when a man in his mid-20s caught Mr El Ghoul’s attention to take delivery of the parcel. Mr El Ghoul says he asked for suitable identification, “he gave me the right name, but the address was wrong”. Mr El Ghoul asked for identification, “he said he lost his glasses. I said I could not give him the parcel without ID”. Mr El Ghoul says the man insisted, “He said it was his. He started getting a bit aggressive”. Mr El Ghoul identified the man in his mid to late 20s, standing approximately 172 centimetres, and weighing somewhere between 70 and 75 kilograms, “he had a bag across his shoulders. He put his hand into it, I thought to get an ID”.

At this point in the interview Mr El Ghoul became both emotional and tearful when he referred to the young man taking a gun out of the bag:

“He put it to my heart, heart. He said that the parcel was his. I froze. I could not see anything. I remember having hold of my scanner, I was shaking. I went blank. I’m not easily scared. I’ve never been so frightened”. Mr El Ghoul volunteered he avoids thinking about that day, “every time I do, I start crying”.”

I omit the next two paragraphs of the history. The history then continues thus:

“Mr El Ghoul states, “It happened again. I went to another address and knocked on the door. They were not the right customers. Then I saw this car, a WRX. It was a big man this time, maybe 95 kilograms”. Mr El Ghoul states he asked for ID. “He went back to the car and pulled out [a] machete. I hopped in my van and took off”. Mr El Ghoul says he dropped the parcel at a post office. Mr El Ghoul states he did not report either of the matters to the police, “I followed the protocol. I reported it to the manager.”


	
	The sworn evidence of the offender is that he reported the incident to a superior, Mr Fury, on the telephone. Mr Fury’s name was given in the proceedings in the Local Court. It is clear that Mr Fury has not been interviewed on behalf of the offender. However, the offender was not challenged in what he said in this regard today by the Crown and the inference to be drawn is that Mr Fury has not been interviewed on behalf of the Crown either. However, I am in a position where I must accept what the offender said in this regard in the light of there being no contradiction from Mr Fury when the Crown has been on notice since the proceedings in the Local Court about his involvement in this case.
	
	
	Furthermore, the offender put before the Local Court, and there is before this Court, an affidavit of Mr Vishal Nayyer sworn on 31 October 2015 in which he deposes to the incident involving the offender and the young male who threatened him with a gun. The only further detail offered by Mr Nayyer is that the male with the gun was of “middle eastern appearance” and heavily tattooed. There is no evidence to rebut what the offender and Mr Nayyer say about this incident and what Mr El Ghoul says about the subsequent incident about with machete. Whilst the detail is inconsistent the thrust of what the offender said and what Mr Nayyer swore in his affidavit is that Mr Fury was advised as to what happened but did not call the offender into the business depot and compile an incident report which appeared to be the normal practice or procedure. The offender himself did not report it to the police. He appears to have believed that that was the responsibility of his employer.
	
	
	According to Mr Borenstein the offender developed a post-traumatic stress disorder following upon those threats to his life. He became vigilant and wary, fearing a recurrence. He became withdrawn and socially isolated. He noticed sleep disturbances and occasional nightmares. Mr El Ghoul swears on oath that it was in such circumstances that he became involved in Ms Carpenter’s fraud. Not only had the offender not told the authorities about these threats to him in late 2012 but he did not tell his family about those threats. He did not tell his wife because she herself was suffering from anxiety and depression for which she was being treated by with psychotropic medication and she had in fact been under psychiatric care and had been at one stage suicidal. Accepting that to be true, it is understandable that he would not tell the members of his family about the threat that he perceived to himself in late 2012.
	
	
	The way in which Mr El Ghoul became involved in Ms Carpenter’s fraud is alluded to in this fashion in the history taken by Mr Borenstein:
	


“Mr El Ghoul continued to be vigilant and wary. He feared recurrence of being threatened. Mr El Ghoul says he felt threatened, “They called my phone, they told me my wife drives a landcruiser, and she drives my son to school. I didn’t want to tell my wife or scare anyone’. Over time Mr El Ghoul says he handed items over without demanding identification. ‘I was frightened. I did not question the ID as much. I needed to work to support my family’.

Mr El Ghoul says that for a year he complied with the demands of Ms Carpenter and her four male friends because he feared for himself and the members of his family. That fear appeared to me to be implausible. However, the offender grew up in Tripoli in southern Lebanon which for many years has been a grossly dysfunctional area of the world. He spent the first 13 years of his life in Tripoli. He left to come to Australia essentially as a refugee from the Lebanese civil war. Whilst Mr El Ghoul was not directly affected by the war he could hear bombing and gunshots from far away. Members of his extended family came to Australia as well. In this country the offender, as I mentioned earlier, has not been involved in any crime that is at all relevant to the current proceedings and has worked consistently and well, and has done much to support his wife and extended family.


	
	In his ‘Opinion’ Mr Borenstein ventured what is not really an opinion but a relevant piece of history. It is this:
	


“Mr El Ghoul says he did not know the persons who [sic] he delivered parcels to. He admits following being traumatised he was less inclined to be insistent on asking for IDs, fearing recurrence of threats and possible injury to himself and his family. Mr El Ghoul says he was subject to veiled threats from persons, who said they knew what car his wife was driving, and also knew where Mr El Ghoul and his family lived.”

The offender swore on oath that he received no money whatever for his being involved in the fraud and received no other benefit. His evidence was that all he himself received was the disadvantage of living in fear and ultimately losing his job with StarTrack Express. He has since found employment as a long haul truck driver.


	
	The only contrition and remorse that the offender expressed was in the witness box today and that was quite accidental. I suspect that he is more contrite and remorseful about the position in which he finds himself and has put his family, rather than being contrite about the damage done to Telstra. Be that as it may, accepting as I must, because he was not challenged in that regard, the offender’s involvement gained him no benefit whatever. He puts himself forward as an unintended and unwilling participant in the fraud whose only motivation was fear. That being so, this offender’s conduct is also of no great moral culpability. When it was put to the offender that he could have reported the fear that he is operating under to his employer or to the authorities, he maintained that he would not do so because of that very fear. He did not consider changing his telephone number because it had been his for a long time and was known to all his extended family both within Australia and overseas. There are ways of overcoming that, but the offender is not to be punished for his foolishness or cowardice, but for his criminality.
	
	
	Again, the learned Magistrate commenced with a head sentence of 20 months which he discounted by 10% for the utilitarian value for the offender’s plea of guilty. Just as I did in Mr Kramarzewski’s case, that should be increased to 20% because the plea whilst not at the earliest available opportunity, was clearly at an early opportunity. Mr El Ghoul’s case ran in the same way as did Mr Kramarzewski, that reduces the head sentence from 18 months to 16 months.
	
	
	Again, the issue here is, how should that be served: should it be served by a full-time custodial sentence or ought it be suspended as was Mr Kramarzewski’s? The offender is younger than Mr Kramarzewski, 51 years of age. While Mr Kramarzewski’s criminality is low, if Mr El Ghoul has told the truth, which I have to accept because otherwise I would be acting cynically, rejecting evidence which was really not challenged, so is Mr El Ghoul’s.
	
	
	Mr El Ghoul is the father of five. He has two children living at home with him, two sons aged 18 and eight, and he is still clearly living with his wife. He has three daughters aged 25, 23 and 20, all of whom are married and he currently has six grandchildren. Again, he is well respected in his local community.
	
	
	I accept, as does the Crown, that there is little prospect of the offender’s reoffending and therefore the corollary is accurate, that the chances of rehabilitation are good. At least the offender is now being treated for his PTSD, although such treatment was only commenced after he was arrested by the police. Again, if one were cynical, one might believe that the treatment was only necessary because of the offenders’ getting into trouble with the law but that is not the effect of his evidence which, as I said, has not been controverted. In the circumstances, I believe it appropriate to suspend this offender’s sentence as well.
	
	
	For those reasons I set aside the sentences passed in the Local Court at Burwood on 4 November 2015.
	
	
	Stan Kramarzewski, I sentence you to imprisonment for a term of 12 months. Under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I order that execution of the sentence be suspended. I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for a term of 12 months commencing today. Conditions of the bond are as follows:
	



	
	you are to appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond;
	
	
	you are to be of good behaviour;
	
	
	you are to reside at 31 Eddie Street, Panania; or
	
	
	you are to advise the Registrar of the Court by prepaid registered post of any change of residential address during the term of the bond.
	



	
	Khaled El Ghoul, I sentence you to imprisonment for a term of one year and four months. Under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I order that execution of the sentence be suspended. I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for a term of one year and four months commencing today. Conditions of the bond are as follows:
	



	
	you are to appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond;
	
	
	you are to be of good behaviour;
	
	
	you are to reside at 2 Robertson Street, Merrylands, New South Wales, 2160; or
	
	
	you are to advise the Registrar of the Court by prepaid registered post of any change of residential address during the term of the bond.
	



	
	Mr Kramarzewski and Mr El Ghoul, I am required to advise you what a suspended sentence means. To be of good behaviour means you have to obey the law. If you do anything other than something trivial then you will be called back before the Court and be sentenced to imprisonment full-time. All that would be left for me to do is to fix the non-parole period. For your Mr Kramarzewski, it means you might go to gaol for eight months, and for you Mr El Ghoul you would go to gaol for at least 12 months, so you know what is hanging over your head for the period of the bond that you will enter into today. Do you understand, gentlemen?
	
	
	Any other orders sought?
	
	
	WILLS: No, thank you, your Honour.
	
	
	RADOJEV: No, thank you, your Honour.
	
	
	LEITNER: No, thank you, your Honour.

		15 July 2016",2015-12-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768530,R v Obeid (No 5) [2015] NSWSC 1967,"EX TemporE Judgment (revised from Transcript)


	
	On 14 December 2015 I granted the accused, Edward Moses Obeid, leave to file in court a notice of motion seeking an order that these proceedings be stayed pending the hearing of an application by him for special leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal dated 8 December 2015 (Obeid v R [2015] NSWCCA 309). I listed the motion for hearing before me today.
	
	
	Mr Obeid is due to stand trial in this Court on 10 February 2016. For the reasons that will be explained, at least one practical effect of granting the order sought by Mr Obeid would be to vacate that trial date and adjourn the trial for a substantial period. For the reasons that follow, the motion will be dismissed and I decline to vacate the trial date.
	
	
	Consistent with previous determinations in relation to these proceedings and it being necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice, I will order pursuant to s 8 of the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010 that this judgment is not to be published.
	


Background


	
	It is necessary to outline the background to this application in some detail. On or about 20 February 2015 a notice was issued out of the District Court of New South Wales to Mr Obeid advising him of the intention of the Director of Public Prosecutions to file an indictment against him on 13 March 2015. Pursuant to a direction issued under s 128(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 an indictment was filed in this Court.
	
	
	On 8 May 2015 Mr Obeid was arraigned in this Court on one count of the common law offence of willfully misconducting himself in public office. He pleaded not guilty. His trial was fixed to commence on 12 October 2015.
	
	
	Although there has been an amendment to the indictment in the meantime, from the commencement of the proceedings, the gravamen of the criminality alleged against Mr Obeid is as described in R v Obeid (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1380 at [14] to [22] (“Obeid No 2”) which should be read together with this judgment. The crime is alleged to have been committed between 1 August 2007 and 30 November 2007 and concerns Mr Obeid's alleged dealings with a senior employee of the Maritime Authority of New South Wales while Mr Obeid was a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales.
	
	
	The only pre-trial application that was notified at the time of Mr Obeid's arraignment was an application under s 132(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act for his trial to be heard by a judge alone. This application was heard by Johnson J on 26 June 2015. His Honour dismissed the application on 7 July 2015 (R v Obeid [2015] NSWSC 897; “Obeid No 1”). Mr Obeid sought leave to appeal from that judgment pursuant to subs 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	On or about 20 August 2015 the Crown notified Mr Obeid that it intended to apply for leave to amend its indictment and provided an amended Crown case statement. This appears to have resulted in an adjournment of the application for leave to appeal from Obeid No 1 which had been listed for hearing on 29 August 2015.
	
	
	On 9 September 2015 I granted the Crown leave to amend its indictment. I also granted Mr Obeid leave to file in Court a notice of motion raising a demurrer to the amended indictment and otherwise seeking to quash the indictment or stay the proceedings. Argument over that application proceeded into the next day with written submissions filed in subsequent days.
	
	
	On 21 September 2015, and prior to providing a judgment on the demurrer application, I varied the commencing date for the trial from 12 October 2015 to 19 October 2015. This course was taken because I was informed that the week of 12 October 2015 would be used for discussions between the parties for the purpose of narrowing the issues in dispute at the trial.
	
	
	On 22 September 2015 I overruled the demurrer and otherwise dismissed Mr Obeid's motion (Obeid No 2). Although a number of matters were addressed in that judgment two matters in particular should be noted. First, I addressed and rejected a contention that a Member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales did not hold a ""public office"" for the purposes of the common law offence of wilful misconduct in public office (Obeid No 2 at [24] to [62]). Second, I addressed and rejected a contention that this Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the charge against Mr Obeid because the subject matter of the charge was within the ""exclusive cognisance"" of the Legislative Council or that a hearing of the charge would infringe Article 9 of the Bill of Rights as it applies in New South Wales (Obeid No 2 at [122] to [159]).
	
	
	On 28 September 2015 I refused an application under s 5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act to certify the orders made on 22 September 2015 as proper ones for appeal (R v Obeid (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 1441). On the same day I heard and refused a further application for a trial by judge alone (R v Obeid (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 1442; “Obeid No 4”).
	
	
	In the meantime Mr Obeid filed an application for leave to appeal from the judgment in Obeid No 2. His application was listed for hearing on 7 October 2015. On 2 October 2015 Mr Obeid applied to RA Hulme J, sitting as the Court of Criminal Appeal, to adjourn that application. His Honour granted the adjournment and listed the application for leave to appeal for hearing on 20 November 2015. In view of that, on 8 October 2015, I vacated the trial date of 19 October 2015. Instead, I listed the trial to commence on 10 February 2016 on the understanding that the Court would not sit on 12 February 2016. Those dates were chosen to suit the convenience of counsel whom it was said will appear for Mr Obeid at the trial.
	
	
	The application for leave to appeal was heard by the Court of Criminal Appeal (Bathurst CJ, Beazley P and Leeming JA) on 20 and 24 November 2016. As noted, judgment was handed down on 8 December 2015. Their Honours granted leave to appeal but dismissed the appeal.
	
	
	Five issues were addressed by the Court of Criminal Appeal which largely reflected the matters argued in Obeid No 2, namely, the jurisdiction of this Court to hear the charge, whether a Member of the Legislative Council is a public officer, whether the hearing of the charge would infringe Article 9 of the Bill of Rights, whether the formulation of the elements of the crime of wilful misconduct in public office stated in R v Quach [2010] VSCA 106; 201 A Crim R 522 is correct and whether I erred in provisionally formulating a duty of a Member of the Legislative Council in terms that are analogous to that owed by a fiduciary. The Court of Criminal Appeal resolved the first four issues adversely to Mr Obeid. In relation to the fifth issue the Court noted the view expressed in Obeid No 2 on that topic was provisional and stated that its final formulation should await the trial (at [151]).
	
	
	On 15 December 2015 an application for special leave to appeal was filed on behalf of Mr Obeid. The two special leave questions identified in the application relate to the first two issues determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal just noted.
	
	
	Finally, at this point it should be noted that none of the matters determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal turned on the amendment to the indictment that was foreshadowed in August 2015. So much of the Crown case as turned on those amendments was only a very minor part of the argument the subject of Obeid No 2 and was irrelevant to the renewed application for trial by judge alone determined by Obeid No 4 (see Obeid No 4 at [96]).
	


Likely Delay


	
	As noted, the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgment was handed down on Tuesday, 8 December 2015. The first date in 2016 on which the High Court is hearing applications for special leave to appeal is 12 February 2016. As noted, the trial is due to commence on 10 February 2016. Somewhat belatedly, on 16 December 2015, Mr Obeid's solicitor made an inquiry of the High Court's Registry and was advised, not surprisingly, that, ""the February 12 special leave list is completely full"", that if submissions were filed quickly, it was nevertheless ""extremely unlikely"" that any such application could be heard on 12 February 2016 and that it was more likely to be heard in March or April 2016. Nevertheless, it was always open to Mr Obeid shortly after the Court of Criminal Appeal published its judgment to quickly file a special leave application and to at least apply to a single judge of the High Court to have the matter listed for hearing on 12 February 2016 with a truncated timetable for the exchange of written submissions. If successful this approach would have effectively preserved the trial date in that empanelment could have been put back to 15 February 2016 when the outcome of the special leave application would be known. I can indicate that if that course was to in fact transpire, I would be likely to accede to such an application as the dates of 10 and 11 February 2016 could still be utilised for pre-trial applications.
	
	
	However, Mr Obeid chose not to take, or even try to take, that course. Instead he has sought a stay of the proceedings generally pending the hearing of an application for special leave on an unspecified date most likely in April 2016 accompanied by an undertaking from his solicitor to pursue the application with expedition. It follows that to accede to the application would involve adjourning the trial date to some unspecified time. Given the state of the lists in this Court, and the fact that Mr Obeid is not in custody, a new trial date would not be likely to be fixed before July 2016, being almost 13 months after the proceedings were first commenced and almost nine years after the events that gave rise to them. An adjournment of the trial for that period would be a significant disruption to the ordinary process of criminal proceedings. The delay may in fact be worse given that Mr Obeid has commenced civil proceedings against persons associated with the Independent Commission Against Corruption's (“ICAC”) inquiries into him, including the inquiry that led to the charge the subject of these proceedings (see Obeid v Ipp (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1852). Those proceedings are listed to be heard in May 2016. A significant amount of publicity is likely to be generated by that matter especially if Mr Obeid gives evidence in his own case and, in turn, that may bear upon the timing of any criminal trial.
	


Approach


	
	The approach that I will adopt to this application is that which I conclude would be adopted by an intermediate Court of Appeal hearing an application to stay criminal proceedings pending an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court.
	
	
	In Rinehart v Welker [2012] NSWCA 1 (""Rinehart"") the Court of Appeal held that the approach to be adopted to whether a stay of the judgment or order should be made in civil proceedings pending an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court was that enunciated by Brennan J in Jennings Constructions v Burgundy Royale Investments (No 1) [1986] HCA 84; 161 CLR 681 at 684 (""Jennings""), namely, that ""exceptional circumstances must be shown"" before the jurisdiction to grant a stay is exercised. Further, in Jennings Brennan J held (at 685) that if a stay is necessary to preserve the subject matter of the appeal, the factors relevant to an assessment of whether a stay should be granted are whether there is a substantial prospect of special leave being granted, the conduct of the applicant for the stay, whether the grant of a stay will cause loss to the respondent and where the balance of convenience lies.
	
	
	To an extent, these principles have an analogous application in relation to criminal proceedings, especially their emphasis on an assessment of the prospects of success of the application for special leave to appeal. However, as I will explain, the analogy is not a complete one. Three related matters should be noted.
	
	
	First, the judgments in Rinehart and Jennings identified the subject matter of the appeal and the necessity to preserve it as a pre-condition to the grant of a stay. In Rinehart at [18] the Court of Appeal cited the following passage from the judgment of Hayne J in Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Limited v Maritime Union of Australia (No 2) [1998] HCA 32; 72 ALJR 869 at [3] to [4], namely:
	


“To speak only of preserving the subject-matter of litigation may in some cases obscure the fact that the jurisdiction can be invoked, if to grant a stay is necessary to prevent the exercise of rights of appeal being rendered futile or their exercise in circumstances where restoration of the status quo cannot be achieved.

The jurisdiction to grant a stay is, however, an extraordinary jurisdiction and exceptional circumstances must be shown before its exercise is warranted.” (emphasis added)


	
	In the context of this matter the reference in this passage to the exercise of the “rights of appeal” not being rendered futile is critical. The reference to the ""restoration of the status quo"" should be seen in that context. Thus the focus of this part of the inquiry is on damage to legal rights. In this case, and subject to the matter next considered, a refusal of special leave will have no effect on Mr Obeid's legal rights in that, if he is convicted, he will still be able to agitate the points he now wishes to argue in a further application to the High Court.
	
	
	Second, Senior Counsel for Mr Obeid, Mr Reynolds SC, identified a “right” of Mr Obeid that was said to be imperilled by the continuation of the prosecution against him as being the ""right not to be exposed proceedings that have no legal substance"" (see Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43; 142 CLR 1 at 24 per Gibbs ACJ; ""Sankey""). Mr Reynolds SC cited Sankey and the decision of Street CJ in Eq in Bacon v Rose & Anor [1972] 2 NSWLR 793 as authorities for his ultimate proposition that any concerns about the fragmentation of the process of a criminal trial are of less weight where the point sought to be raised is one that either goes to the jurisdiction of the Court or the validity of the charge in question. In my view care should be taken in relying on those decisions in the present context. The decisions cited concerned either a civil court or an appellate court exercising a declaratory and not an appellate jurisdiction in respect of criminal proceedings (described as ""administrative or ministerial"" by Street CJ in Eq in Bacon at 797). However, this case concerns an application for leave to make a further interlocutory appeal in circumstances where the Court of Criminal Appeal and, to the extent relevant I, have already determined that the “right” identified by Mr Reynolds SC by reference to Sankey is not imperilled.
	
	
	Third, ultimately the approach adopted by the High Court to interlocutory appeals in criminal cases and which therefore informs applications such as this one was enunciated in the following passage in R v Elliott [1996] HCA 21; 185 CLR 250 at 257:
	


“Obviously two considerations are in competition here. On the one hand, the prosecution is entitled no less than the defence to a trial according to correct rulings on questions of law. On the other, interlocutory appeals in criminal trials delay the trial and are likely to produce miscarriages of justice in ways unrelated to the ruling. The personal and financial stress of criminal trials, the dimming of witnesses' memories and the sheer delay between criminal conduct and the administration of condign punishment are factors which weigh heavily in favour of expediting the process of the criminal trial even though incorrect rulings have to be accepted by the prosecution in order to achieve that object, subject to s 450A. The legislative scheme gives greater weight to the dispatch of criminal trials than it has given to protecting the prosecution's ability to appeal against rulings which it thinks to be incorrect.

It follows that a grant of special leave in the present case would significantly frustrate the process of the criminal trial as prescribed by the Victorian Parliament. This Court has long been extremely reluctant to intervene in criminal trials by granting special leave to appeal against interlocutory decisions. The present case, though it raises important questions for consideration, does not warrant a departure from the practice of this Court and the policy that is manifest in the Crimes Act (Vict).” (emphasis added)


	
	The judgment in Elliott concerned a proposed interlocutory appeal by the Crown but it is equally applicable to such an application by the accused. The approach stated in Elliott has been consistently applied to such applications by accused persons in the High Court (see, for example, Abibadra & Ors v The Queen [2011] HCA Trans 171; Michael Aubrey (aka Albury) v The Queen [2013] HCA Trans 110) including in cases where a reasonably arguable constitutional point was raised (see, for example, Adler v The Queen [2004] HCA Trans 546).
	
	
	The written and oral submissions made on behalf of Mr Obeid by Mr Reynolds SC repeatedly emphasised the lack of supposed urgency in the hearing of the charge against him and the lack of prejudice that would be suffered by the Crown if there was to be another reasonably lengthy adjournment of the trial.
	
	
	The above passage from Elliott illustrates the fallacy in this approach which appears to draw upon an analogy with the delay in the hearing of civil proceedings in considering whether a stay or lengthy adjournment pending an application for special leave to appeal should be granted in a criminal case. In criminal cases the imperilling of the expeditious dispatch of the trial of serious charges by interlocutory appeals is per se prejudicial and as such is to be avoided as much as possible. It is both in the community's and in the accused's interests that such proceedings be heard as quickly as possible. Delays, especially delays caused by interlocutory appeals, have the potential to undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system. In this case the delay between the alleged ""criminal conduct"" and the potential ""administration of condign punishment"" is already significant (see Elliott). Further, the passage of time since the events the subject of the charge has the real potential to affect the recollections of the various witnesses, in particular the evidence of the person referred to in the indictment which is likely to be of great significance to the outcome of the case. The fact that he may have previously given evidence before the ICAC is of little moment.
	
	
	It follows from what I have already found that the delay and relevant prejudice that would be occasioned by acceding to the motion in its present form is a substantial barrier to it being granted.
	


Prospects of Success


	
	It follows from the above that one matter of great significance to the application is the prospects of success of the application for special leave to appeal.
	
	
	As noted, the application for special leave to appeal identifies the first two matters determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal described above as matters that warrant a grant of special leave. The written submissions contend that the so-called exclusive cognisance point ""involves multiple points of the highest jurisprudential and constitutional importance"", that the second point exposes an issue on which there was a ""2:2 split"" in the High Court (in R v Boston [1923] HCA 59; 33 CLR 386), that there is ""substantial doubt"" in relation to the Court of Criminal Appeal's reasoning and that this case is a suitable vehicle for the determination of those points.
	
	
	In amplification of those submissions, the written submissions point to various alleged errors in the Court of Criminal Appeal's reasoning and assert that the various arguments put to the Court of Criminal Appeal were not addressed. The submissions also emphasise how the first special leave question is jurisdictional in nature and the submissions rise to the level of contending that it is ""inappropriate for this Court to proceed to hear a matter in which there are substantial doubts about its jurisdiction"". This contention rose even higher in oral submissions as it was submitted that, if I was to preside over the trial of Mr Obeid, I would be at risk of being declared to be in contempt of Parliament (citing the precedent from 1667 referred to in R v Chaytor [2011] 1 AC 684 at [114]).
	
	
	Detailed submissions were provided in support of all these points, which I have considered. However, bearing in mind the approach stated in Elliott, I consider that the prospects of special leave to appeal being granted are very low. Four matters should be noted.
	
	
	First, the question of ""exclusive cognisance"" was decided by the Court of Criminal Appeal on the (very favourable) assumption to Mr Obeid that the ""powers and privileges of the Legislative Council are, subject to statute, the same as those of the House of Commons"" ([2015] NSWSC 309 at [18]) and without determining whether the Australia Act 1986 (Cth) and the Australia Act 1986 (UK) (“the Australia Acts”) had that effect. This occurred in circumstances where a deliberate decision had been made not to issue notices under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) agitating that issue (at [16]). No reliance was placed on the Australia Acts in the proceedings before me (Obeid No 2 at [148]). On this application, Mr Reynolds SC contended that the absence of s 78B notices does not represent any impediment to his relying on the Australia Acts. I will not enter further into that debate, which may raise a question about the operation of s 106 of the Constitution. It suffices to note that this is potentially a significant matter affecting the suitability of these proceedings as a vehicle for the determination of the first issue on an interlocutory appeal.
	
	
	Second, the Court of Appeal's judgment was unanimous. A reading of that judgment does not suggest any room for substantial doubt on the answer to the two principal points said to found an application for special leave.
	
	
	Third, given the fragmentation of the process of criminal justice that ensues from interlocutory appeals in such cases, another matter affecting whether special leave will be granted is likely to be an assessment of whether the appeal is likely to succeed. Experience suggests that there is a category of case that raises issues of general legal importance that are the subject of a grant of special leave to appeal even though the High Court does not consider that the particular applicant's prospects of ultimate success are strong. Such cases often result in the appeal being dismissed but the High Court's judgment represents a definitive statement of the law on the particular topic. However, an interlocutory appeal in criminal proceedings, where the same points can be the subject of an appeal if the applicant is convicted, generally does not fall into that category.
	
	
	In that regard, and as noted, Mr Reynolds SC's submissions sought to detail the alleged flaws in the Court of Criminal Appeal's reasoning. Ultimately, he contended that the principal flaw in the Court's judgment in respect of both issues was the Court's alleged failure to state a definitive legal test from which the conclusions on jurisdiction and public officer followed. Assuming, without deciding, that that is a correct analysis of the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgment and that constitutes a ""flaw"", that is a type of point best considered in any appeal following conviction, but not in an interlocutory appeal.
	
	
	In the end result, for Mr Obeid to ultimately be successful in any appeal, he will have to persuade the High Court that parliamentarians who act outside the parliamentary chamber and use their position to secure pecuniary advantages for themselves or their associates from the executive are immune from the jurisdiction of the criminal courts and that, unlike other public officials, they are immune from the offence charged. Such an outcome would be counterintuitive, to put it politely. I regard Mr Obeid's prospects of demonstrating that to be very low.
	
	
	Fourth, of the points raised in support of the application, perhaps the strongest is the contention that a jurisdictional argument of substance might constitute an exceptional circumstance as referred to in Elliott. However, for the reasons given by the Court of Criminal Appeal, that argument is particularly weak. The conduct did not occur in the parliamentary chamber and there is nothing to suggest it was in any way connected to such proceedings in the chamber. In relation to the concept of public officer, I consider that the strong trend of authority is that parliamentarians are such persons, and that conclusion accords with the underlying rationale for the offence in question.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the test stated in Elliott, I consider Mr Obeid's prospects of obtaining special leave to appeal to be very low.
	


Other Factors


	
	Most of the balance of the points raised in support of this application concern prejudice and the effect of delay. They have already been addressed. However, three matters in particular should be noted.
	
	
	First, one part of Mr Reynolds SC's written submissions contends that there would be ""massive prejudice"" to Mr Obeid if a stay is not granted in that he will be faced with the ""stress and expense of a criminal trial"" for which there may be no jurisdictional basis and, if convicted but his special leave points are later vindicated, he will suffer ""needless huge damage to his reputation"".
	
	
	As stated, the focus of considering prejudice on applications such as this concerns the effect of a refusal or a grant of stay on legal rights and interests. However, I accept that matters of this kind can also be considered.
	
	
	I attribute very little weight to a suggestion of harm occasioned by the expense of a criminal trial. There is no evidence before the Court as to Mr Obeid's means. However, I note that since at least August 2015 Mr Obeid has had two teams of counsel working on his case. Over time this Court has been advised of five different counsel who would appear at the trial on his behalf, four of whom are senior counsel.
	
	
	Even without evidence, I can accept that facing a criminal trial will occasion stress to Mr Obeid, although unresolved pending charges also weigh heavily on accused persons.
	
	
	As for reputational damage, I pass over the reputational benefit that Mr Obeid may derive if he is acquitted. The premise of both applications for a trial by judge alone was that Mr Obeid's reputation had already been irreparably damaged by ICAC's investigations into him and the subsequent publicity. In Obeid No 4 at [69] I accepted that contention to an extent. However, I accept that if Mr Obeid is convicted, further damage to his reputation is likely to follow, and that may not be totally remedied if he is later vindicated on appeal. Nevertheless, in balancing the competing interests that arise from a significant delay in a criminal trial occasioned by an interlocutory appeal, the potential for unremediable reputational damage from the trial proceeding is a matter that does not carry substantial weight compared to the relevant prejudice that arises from a delay in the trial.
	
	
	Second, it was suggested that there was some inconsistency between the Crown agreeing to the vacation of the earlier trial date following the adjournment of Mr Obeid's application for leave to appeal from Obeid No 2 and the refusal of the Crown to agree to the vacation of the trial date at this point. Given the different stages of the judicial hierarchy that are involved and the difference between the test for leave to appeal compared with the test for special leave to appeal, there is no such inconsistency.
	
	
	Third and lastly, it was contended that there may be other prosecutions pending in this Court that raise the same issues as are the subject of the special leave application. The Crown disputed this, and I am in no position to resolve that dispute. If there are such cases then the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgment governs the position.
	


Conclusion


	
	When the true prejudice arising from the delay in the trial that is likely to arise if this application were granted is identified, it becomes clear that the interests of justice do not warrant acceding to it. When that is considered with the above assessment of the prospects of success of the application for special leave to appeal and with the fact that the points sought to be raised by Mr Obeid can be agitated in the event that he is convicted, the result is that the application must be dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	Accordingly, the orders of the Court are:
	



	
	The notice of motion filed 14 December 2015 be dismissed.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 8 of the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), it being necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice, this judgment is not to be published.

2768534,R v Harvey & Boye [2015] NSWDC 398,"sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Two men appear before me today for sentence, each having pleaded guilty to particular charges on an indictment that was presented when I was sitting at the Bathurst sittings of the District Court of New South Wales. Mr Harvey and Mr Boye both pleaded guilty to a charge set out in count 2 that they each at Kelso on 11 November 2011 while in the company of each other recklessly caused grievous bodily harm to Luke Hutchin. They were jointly charged in relation to that matter as an alternative to a count of cause grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, to which they pleaded not guilty. The plea entered by them was accepted by the Crown in full discharge of that part of the indictment.
	
	
	Mr Harvey was separately arraigned and pleaded guilty to a charge of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to Alecia Cole. That plea of guilty was in respect of a charge that was an alternative to a charge alleging that he, while in company with Mr Boye, cause grievous bodily harm to Alecia Cole.
	
	
	In respect of the common charge to the two accused, the recklessly cause grievous bodily harm in company, the maximum penalty for that offence under s 35(1) Crimes Act 1900 is 14 years imprisonment, with a standard non parole period of five years imprisonment.
	
	
	With regard to the offence of recklessly cause grievous bodily harm, an offence contrary to s 35(2) Crimes Act 1900, the maximum penalty of imprisonment is ten years with a standard non-parole period of four years. There are no other charges to consider by reason of a Form 1 or a s 166 certificate. Both men have been in custody prior to sentencing in relation to the current matters.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Harvey, to deal with him particularly, I am informed he has been in continuous custody from 18 October 2013 up until the present time, however, I am unable to take into account all of that time in custody for the simple reason that on 1 May 2014 he was convicted at the Bathurst Local Court in respect of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, that offence being committed on 17 October 2013 and sentenced to six months imprisonment commencing on 18 October 2013. Thus, part of the time with which I am concerned so far as his time in custody is concerned is referrable to another offence. However, as was indicated by the remarks I made to Mr Harvey before I commenced the sentencing observations, I propose to commence the sentence imposed upon him in January 2014. The first of the sentences I am required to impose will be partially accumulative upon that sentence of six months. Obviously, I appreciate I have a wide discretion in relation to the matter, I could have made the sentences I impose entirely accumulative, but in the circumstances to reflect totality of criminality principles I have not done so.
	
	
	Just dealing with Mr Harvey for a moment on another matter. He was on parole at the time of the commission of the offences with which I am concerned in relation to him. It is self-evident that offences committed while subject to parole represents a breach of conditional liberty of some seriousness and that is an aggravating factor under s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Hereinafter I will refer to that legislation as “the Act.” However, in relation to the revocation of his parole that followed upon him coming into custody in October 2013, I am advised by reference to the custody record that the prisoner’s balance of parole was merely two months and two days. I use the word “merely” to represent the fact that had it been considerably longer, if it had run, for example, for the period of time that was imposed in respect of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm conviction to which I referred then I would be required to have regard to the principles in decisions such as Callaghan from 2006, particularly Simpson J’s observations that caution is required to be exercised when finding an aggravating factor such as an offence committed in breach of parole where there’s been a revocation of parole and the need to ensure that one does not double dip. As it transpires the sentence I impose starts after the completion of that balance of sentence relevant to that revocation of parole.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Boye, he was arrested and charged in relation to the current matters in circumstances where he has been in custody since 31 January 2015. Thus, the sentences I impose will date from that date and will take into account all of the time spent in custody. He, likewise, was subject to conditional liberty at the time of the offending with which I am concerned, but the matter that he was restrained by was a s 9 bond for a period of 12 months in relation to a driving offence. That is still obviously a breach of conditional liberty not quite as serious as an offence committed whilst on parole. I will come back to the calculation of the effective non-parole period relevant to Mr Boye in a moment.
	
	
	In respect of the two offenders I have an agreed statement of facts. Although there are matters in dispute, I have concluded ultimately that the matters in dispute are not of such significance as to warrant any particular analysis on my part. Many of the matters concerning the issues in dispute were discussed in the course of submissions.
	
	
	The facts of the matter are that on Friday 11 November 2011 Mr Harvey drove Mr Boye and two other people, Mr Peters and Mr Hutchin to premises at Kelso. The premises at Kelso were occupied as I would understand it by one of the men in the car, that is Brady Hutchin, at least he had clothes at the premises. It was also occupied by Alecia Cole who was a former partner of the prisoner Boye and Luke Hutchin who I take to be the brother of Brady Hutchin.
	
	
	There was some acrimony obviously between Mr Boye and Ms Cole. I am not in a position to make a judgment in respect of that matter. They had a child of their relationship and clearly there was some bad feeling that it had bubbled over on this particular night. In fact, according to the facts,
	
	
	Mr Boye and Ms Cole had an acrimonious telephone conversation which I am prepared to accept Mr Harvey was largely unaware of.
	
	
	When Mr Harvey arrived with the other men in a motor vehicle, they remained seated in the car, the child of the relationship between Mr Boye and Ms Cole was at other premises. There is absolutely no doubt based upon the agreed facts that Ms Cole came over to the motor vehicle and commenced having what appears to be an argument with the prisoner Boye. It is to be noted for the purposes of reflecting upon issues, such as pre-meditation and deliberation and planning, that during the course of this argument the prisoners Mr Harvey and Mr Boye remained seated in the car. Words were exchanged and obviously tempers got heated.
	
	
	The facts refer to some evidence given by Jacob Peters at a previous proceeding at the Bathurst District Court to the proceedings with which I was involved, I am informed that Judge Hanley was sitting at Bathurst and conducted a Basha inquiry in relation to matters concerning a forthcoming trial involving the accused Harden. Part of the evidence of Mr Peters forms part of the agreed facts. The Crown does not necessarily accept Mr Peters’ version of events and ultimately it must be said that my capacity, if needs be, to resolve disputes as to the facts is extremely limited given the fact that I did not see Mr Peters give any evidence and nobody has called the victims or the prisoners to resolve some of these matters.
	
	
	One of the matters asserted by Mr Peters that was Ms Cole was in the possession of a screwdriver or a chisel and was threatening Mr Boye as she stood at the driver’s door speaking across Mr Harvey in the driver’s seat during the course of their heated argument. In my view whether she had a screwdriver or a chisel is of little moment. It seems to me so because the first act of violence in the matter was not involving Ms Cole but it was an act of violence towards Mr Hutchin.
	
	
	That having been said the facts make it abundantly clear that, when Mr Boye got out of the motor vehicle and walked across the front yard or into the front yard of the premises Mr Hutchin removed his shirt and approached Mr Boye and the two of them fell to fighting, not that I am approving fighting in public places. As it can be shown in this case it can sometimes get out of hand as happened on this occasion but the truth of the matter is Mr Hutchin a victim in relation to count 2, was a willing participant in acts of violence perpetrated by Mr Boye and Mr Hutchin upon each other.
	
	
	It would seem as though in the course of the fight Mr Boye got the better of Mr Hutchin as can happen in fights and got on top of Mr Hutchin and commenced to punch him repeatedly in the head with his fists. Ms Cole seeing her then partner being bettered by Mr Boye determined that she would assist him. I appreciate complex issues of rescue or defence of a third party and the like coming into play here, but she returned to the fray with a wooden didgeridoo. A photograph of it in a broken state is part of the evidence in the proceedings.
	
	
	If she had not introduced the didgeridoo into the fight, I have got no doubt that it would not have become the weapon that it subsequently did. When she brought the didgeridoo back it is alleged in the disputed facts that Cole handed to didgeridoo to Hutchin and he swung it towards Boye’s head. There is no suggestion that he struck Mr Boye with it. The Crown asserts that Mr Harvey dispossessed Hutchin of the didgeridoo and it would seem to me quite clear that he did so at some point because ultimately Mr Harvey ended up with the didgeridoo in his hand.
	
	
	Mr Peters supports the version concerning Mr Hutchin using the didgeridoo as a weapon initially against Mr Boye. It would seem on any view of the facts, however, that Boye and Hutchin again fell to fighting and again Mr Boye got the better of Mr Hutchin, continuing to punch him to the head at a time when Ms Cole no longer had the didgeridoo. It was at this point that the prisoner Harvey struck Mr Hutchin to the head with the didgeridoo. Mr Boye, it is agreed after the victim got struck to the head with the didgeridoo, got to his feet and kicked Mr Hutchin to the head on a number of occasions as Mr Hutchin was motionless on the ground. He was effectively defenceless. Whether he was defenceless because of blows to the head from Mr Boye, from the striking of him by Mr Harvey with the didgeridoo or by a combination of those two offender’s actions I am clearly unable to say.
	
	
	In relation to this aspect of the matter the two prisoners were jointly charged in relation to the same count to which they have pleaded guilty. They are charged with being in company of one and other. Mr Thomas in his usual erudite and concise way pointed to the in company feature as being the predominant characteristic of the joint conduct rather than “joint criminal enterprise” but the bottom line is of course that as now a particular person can be proven beyond reasonable doubt to have inflicted the grievous bodily harm that Mr Hutchin actually suffered. Clearly their joint responsibility for the grievous bodily harm that was suffered arises out of the concept of an on-going but short lived criminal enterprise.
	
	
	Ms Cole intervened when Mr Hutchin was obviously defenceless. At this point Mr Harvey struck Ms Cole across the back with the didgeridoo. As she turned towards Harvey he struck her again this time hitting her on the arm. Whether her arm was up in a defensive position or whether it was just bad fortunate, it is not possible for me to say on these facts. When struck on the arm she yelled out, “Please stop, please don’t hit me”, at which point Mr Harvey who had the didgeridoo apparently poised pulled out of a swing that ultimately connected with her arm.
	
	
	It would seem on the basis of that part of the facts that there was not any deliberation on the part of the prisoner to strike a particular part of her body. Hence his plea to an allegation of reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm. The didgeridoo was damaged and I have a photograph of it broken at a particular point. The splintering I can see in the relevant break is consistent, it seems to me, was some defect in the timber. I could not conclude beyond reasonable doubt as to the amount of force that was generated such as to cause the didgeridoo to break as was submitted by Mr Thomas.
	
	
	Mr Harvey, Mr Boye and Mr Peters apparently then left the scene. The other Mr Hutchin must have remained at the scene. Mr Luke Hutchin, the victim in relation to count 2, suffered serious injuries, he had a large laceration across his head five centimetres long and one centimetre deep and abrasions to his body. He was admitted to Westmead Hospital with a “serious closed head injury” and was then placed in an induced coma within ICU for several days.
	
	
	This was clearly a step taken as a preventative measure and it would seem that he fully recovered from the injuries suffered with no permanent disability. Ms Cole was treated in relation to an undisplaced fracture to her wrist. I have a photograph of her with her arm in a cast of some description, with traverse fractures of the vertebrae at L1 to L4. I have a photograph of her back showing a rather large bruise.
	
	
	The facture to the vertebrae did not compromise the mechanical stability of the spine. There was no spinal cord injury, the vertebrae injury was treated with pain management and she fully recovered from her injuries. So neither victim suffered a permanent disability, but clearly the injuries were grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	Investigators sought to locate Mr Boye and Mr Harvey. Apparently they travelled to South Australia. Warrants were issued for their arrest. On 25 April 2012 the prisoner Mr Boye came to the attention of South Australia police. New South Wales police were informed of the arrest but a Commander of the New South Wales Police Force declined to authorise extradition to New South Wales. I will deal with the issue of delay in this case, taking into account that aspect of the matter and other aspects at a later time.
	
	
	On 18 October 2013 I am informed by Mr Thomas, and I have no reason to doubt what he tells me from the bar table, the prisoner Harvey surrendered himself to police at Bathurst.
	
	
	He was, it would seem, already wanted in relation to an offence committed the day before these events concerning the assault occasioning actual bodily harm matter to which I referred for which he was sentenced to six months imprisonment. But he also knew that there was a warrant for his arrest in relation to the matters with which I am concerned and he went into custody from that time as I said.
	
	
	In November 2014 New South Wales police sought extradition of the prisoner Boye from South Australia. This was, I note, two years and eight months after declining to do so. He presumably remained on bail and ultimately when extradited came into custody and has remained in custody since that time.
	
	
	I will deal firstly with the material relevant to Mr Boye’s circumstances. His subjective case was limited but in the material in the Crown case I have his criminal history. He was born, as I understand it, on 28 March 1985. That would mean at this time he is now 30 years of age. At the time of the commission of the offence he would have been approximately 26 years of age. He, like Mr Harvey, has a lengthy history although he does not have as lengthy a history for violence as Mr Harvey. He has a number of appearances in the Children’s Court throughout 2000, 2001 and 2002 with a range of offences of varying types that I need not dwell upon. In respect of his appearances in the Children’s Court ultimately he found himself being committed to Juvenile Justice detention in respect of one offence, a breaking, entering and steal matter. After an appeal to the District Court he ended up with a term of 18 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of six months.
	
	
	As an adult he has a number of appearances in the Local Court in respect of a range of offences including assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2004 for an offence committed on 25 June 2003. He was sentenced apparently to periodic detention of 12 months with a non-parole period of eight months. He has a number of street offences. He has a number of driving offences of no great significance, although he has a conviction on 19 October 2007 of driving whilst under the influence of alcohol or drugs for which he was convicted and fined and disqualified.
	
	
	In February 2008 in respect of offences committed in December 2007 he was convicted of a number of offences which resulted in terms of imprisonment encompassing a period of 12 months with a non-parole period of six months. Those offences were using an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension, two counts of common assault and a count of contravene an apprehended domestic violence order. He also received a sentence of four months imprisonment, apparently concurrent with the other sentences, for demanding property with menaces with intent to steal. He next appeared in 2010 and was convicted of common assault, amongst other matters, for which he was placed on a bond to be of good behaviour for six months commencing on 18 April 2011.
	
	
	On the same date as he appeared in relation to those matters, as far as I can understand it from the criminal history, he was also convicted on 18 April 2011 at the Bathurst Local Court, of driving whilst disqualified. For this he was placed on a good behaviour bond pursuant to s 9 of the Act for a period of 12 months and it is that particular bond that he was in breach of when he committed the subject offence. He was also convicted on that occasion in respect of an offence of resisting an officer in the execution of his duty and given a conviction without further penalty. Those two offences, I hasten to say, had been committed almost a year before.
	
	
	He has convictions in South Australia following upon, as I would understand it, his flight to South Australia but the most relevant convictions for which he received modest penalties were convictions for common assault and ‘commit assault causing harm in circumstances of aggravation’, each of those offences committed on 30 November 2013 and dealt with on 5 September 2014.
	
	
	In respect of the pre-sentence report concerning him there is reference to his supervision previously, his response to supervision previously was deemed suitable. He was in employment at the time of the offending involved in rail track maintenance and I understand that Mr Harvey too was involved in some employment concerned with the railways. In fact he had apparently worked a nine day shift immediately before the offences with which I am now concerned. He was thought not to require any further interventions from the Community Corrections Service.
	
	
	He is one of four children. Apparently he grew up in Bathurst. His family was the victim, if I can use that expression as most families are in the general sense, of domestic violence from the father. His mother and father separated when he was 14 years of age. The prisoner has a daughter now who is aged 11 and she lives with her mother in Bathurst. The report states that after he went to Adelaide he more or less commenced a ”new life” and sought to distance himself from what he believed were possible “reprisals” in relation to the current offences. He was in a permanent relationship and he and his partner or “wife” have a property together in Adelaide. It would be the case, as I would understand it, he would return there once he had completed his sentence. The prisoner’s mother has moved away from Bathurst to Branxton, which I take to be in the Hunter Valley, and she has confirmed some of the background details.
	
	
	The prisoner was a little unlucky in his early life. On leaving school he commenced an apprenticeship. However, the firm with which he worked failed and he lost his employment and he had to move to another apprenticeship as a boilermaker but he was unable to complete that particular occupation. When he was in Adelaide prior to his arrest he was in employment working for a building materials manufacturing company.
	
	
	With regard to the offending in this matter the prisoner acknowledged that the relationship with his partner had contributed to the offending. He expressed remorse for what had happened. He blamed himself for harming the victim. He recognised his conduct as stupid. He used the expression “my pride got the better of me”. He is considered at medium risk of re-offending. If he was released to parole and was required to live in New South Wales he could live with his mother in Branxton. He may be able to get a transfer to South Australia in due course. He has a settled lifestyle to return to in Adelaide which I have taken into account. With regard to the offending with which he was concerned he still feared reprisals and he said that the violence involved went beyond what he envisaged.
	
	
	Turning to Mr Harvey’s circumstances, his criminal history very much mirrors much of what I know about his personal life. His parents separated when he was quite young and at one point he lived in Queensland with a parent and his criminal history reflects this. He commenced offending in 1996 and has a number of appearances in the Queensland Children’s Court for a range of offences including offences of violence. He has in fact quite a number of appearances in that jurisdiction
	
	
	When he came back to New South Wales it would appear in about 2000 being then approximately 16 years of age. He commenced appearing in the Children’s Court and appeared in the Children’s Court in relation to a number of offences as an adult. He has convictions for contravening apprehended violence orders for which he has been convicted and fined, taking and driving a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment in 2002 of 12 months with a non-parole period of six months. He was, as I understand it, at the same time convicted of an offence of threaten or cause injury to a person “being a witness”. There were two counts involved in relation to that and he was sentenced to 12 months with a six month non-parole period.
	
	
	Back in Bathurst, those other two convictions being recorded in the North Coast, he was convicted at the Bathurst Local Court for breaking, entering and stealing and given an 18 months good behaviour bond. He was called up in relation to that bond I note about a year after it was given to him and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with a nine month non-parole period. However, that was sentenced. I note that within seven months of that he was called up in relation to that bond and sentenced to that term of imprisonment. An appeal was unsuccessful.
	
	
	He was later convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm land sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with a nine month non-parole period. He was further convicted in 2009 in respect of offences committed in 2007 of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which he was sentenced to two years imprisonment with a non-parole period of what is described as one month.
	
	
	He was convicted of destroying or damaging property. He was convicted on the same date in 2009 for a 2008 offence of common assault for which he was sentenced to 11 months imprisonment and in respect of another offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, committed in January 2009, on the same date he was sentenced to another period of two years imprisonment.
	
	
	He was on parole in relation to one or other of those offences, as I said, at the time of the commission of the two offences with which I am now concerned. He has those two convictions that I have noted from 2013. There are other findings of guilt dealt with in the Local Court including, convictions for possessing drugs, consistent with the history that emerges from the Community Corrections Service report and the psychological report.
	
	
	With regard to the pre-sentence report it is a very lengthy report and a very detailed report. During his supervision in 2002, his progress was said to be satisfactory but subsequently it has been noted in the course of supervision that he has had a number of issues to address including ongoing illicit substance abuse issues as well what are described as “violent behaviours”.
	
	
	What the Community Corrections Service observes is that in Mr Harvey’s case, initially his response to supervision is quite positive, but as time wears on there is more and more non-compliance. There are some details in relation to the report as to the circumstances of his breach of parole. I also note his performance in custody which is detailed at some length, most recently with a number of what could be called “prison offences” or “institutional misconduct” charges against him and I have taken that into account.
	
	
	He has been subject to a substantial period of segregation at one point in respect of the disputes he had with correctional officers. During his time in custody he has engaged with psychology staff fairly regularly. His motivation has been to access assistance and to regulation of his emotional management and dealing with his anxiety. I note during the period of time he has been in custody that he has been in some form of protection. He fears some reprisals from other inmates, particularly Aboriginal inmates.
	
	
	Mr Harvey, if he does not mind me saying so, is clearly a formidable man who, no doubt, is quite capable in many respects of looking after himself. But I accept that he has been in protection and I accept this is a matter I should take into account to some extent in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	He is engaged in some employment in various roles during his time in custody. He was employed as a cleaner at one point at one institution but at the moment, as I understand it, he has been at Parklea Correctional Centre without work.
	
	
	His dysfunctional background, if I may call it that and I mean no disrespect to his parents of course, is referred in the report. His parents split when he was quite young and he clearly was not responsible for that and he had to move between his mother and his father. As I understand the matter his father moved to Queensland. Apparently he still maintains a relationship with his father but his mother appears to have some attitude of indifference to their relationship.
	
	
	The prisoner has two children at the moment aged seven and four from two separate relationships. He has contact with one child but not the other. There is some form of apprehended domestic violence order in place in respect of one of those relationships.
	
	
	He gives a background of behavioural issues as a child which I will deal with in the context of the psychological report. He concedes that up until the age of 24 he did not have much employment but when his first daughter was born that gave him some incentive to work more frequently and he has been working reasonably regularly over the years. He has got a history, as I have said, of poly-substance abuse starting at an early age and has from time to time binged both on alcohol and amphetamines, most recently immediately before he came back into custody in 2013.
	
	
	He has a number of infractions in relation to the use of either prohibited drugs or prescribed drugs whilst in custody but he says that that is now under control.
	
	
	With regard to factors related to offending the Community Corrections Service officer observes, and I believe it is reflected in the criminal history as well as his custodial behaviour, that Mr Harvey has a “tendency to perpetuate violent behaviours”. I will come back to the analysis of the offending, but it must be fairly said that if that be a common problem for him and one that, in fact, exhibited itself on this occasion I have taken into account what has been said by Mr Thomas most skilfully that the prisoner was not the architect of the beginning of the violence that occurred on this particular occasion. He was somewhat captive to circumstances beyond his control.
	
	
	The prisoner denied that the offences were premeditated and I have concluded that that must be so based upon those agreed facts that are not in dispute. He told the Community Corrections Service that he, in one sense, thought he was acting in a form of defence of another and that he did react instinctively. The first proposition I could not accept but I do accept that he did react instinctively rather than in any considered way.
	
	
	He does deny any real responsibility for his offending. A position I understand in the context of some of the objective circumstances, but certainly not a realistic position.
	
	
	He is at medium to high risk of reoffending. There are a large of number of issues that he needs to address, both his drug abuse and alcohol abuse, his violence and his aggression and a number of emotional and other issues.
	
	
	He has a leg injury but says that it does not greatly inhibit him. Community Corrections believed that he was polite during the interview. He appeared honest and forthcoming in relation to information given. He is a relatively young man with a troubled background as most young men coming to Court charged with offences of this type usually are. He acknowledged the character of the injuries inflicted upon the victim, however, and said that he would be willing to subject himself to supervision in the future.
	
	
	This brings me to Mr Borenstein’s report. It is a most helpful report. Mr Thomas and I had some discussion about it in the course of the submissions. I had not fully absorbed its details and I somewhat understated in my interaction with Mr Thomas the effect of it. I do not propose to go through the personal details of the prisoner and work history and other matters. I have taken those matters into account from this history and other histories given by the prisoner.  
	
	
	What I wish to particularly concentrate on, however, was Mr Borenstein’s history from the prisoner which I am prepared to accept. That he, as a young child, was taken by his mother to see either a psychologist or a psychiatrist. He was told that he was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder as well as Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ADD/ADHD/ASD).
	
	
	He was treated with a number of medicines including Zoloft and Ritalin which can have permanent effects on people particularly when prescribed to children of a young age. His treatment was not continuous, however, because his father, who was then separated from his mother, did not agree with this medical intervention and as I understand the matter his father would stop him using medication and when he went back to his mother he would go back onto the medication. He had a lot of interruption to his schooling moving back and forth between New South Wales and Queensland and he said that his mother would on occasions, “dose me up” in relation to the medication he was prescribed.
	
	
	He had a number of abilities though. He was a good sportsman I am told. He was captain of one of the schools he attended in primary school. He had abilities in rugby league and other sports and he gives the impression of being a naturally athletic man. But because of his underlying conditions he obviously had difficulty with attention and focus and also had low tolerance to frustration, distractibility and irritability, was prone to angry outbursts and his criminal history reflects this.
	
	
	Clearly I accept that he has conditions that are or were beyond his control. He has difficulty maintaining relationships. His physical health includes the leg injury to which I referred but it does not impair him greatly.
	
	
	Mr Borenstein conducted some psychometric testing. He did a Personality Assessment test which reflected the prisoner having a marked potential for emotional and/or behavioural problems. Again his criminal history reflects this. He had an elevated result on those scores under the test that reflected “acting out” behaviours. He had particular problems with impulsivity and a tendency to be compulsive. There are some other matters that I do not propose to put on the record that I have taken into account.
	
	
	He has had difficulties in his personal relationships as I have earlier pointed out. A depression/anxiety stress scale reflects severe symptoms of depression and anxiety but whether they are reactive to his current circumstances or not neither Mr Borenstein nor I can say. He is a rather disjointed historian to be fair to the detail of Mr Borenstein’s report, but he reflected clinically as a person who was easily distracted which was consistent with the history that was given but there is no suggestion of any serious psychiatric disorder. There is no evidence of psychosis. His thought processes were normal. There was no cognitive impairment.
	
	
	With regard to the assessment of him Mr Borenstein points out that the earlier diagnoses would explain much of his behaviour. He described much of his life as being “directionless”. He reflected upon the prisoner’s capacities as a worker and in terms of pursuing activities like reading and the like and reflected upon the prisoner’s version of events.
	
	
	He thought the prisoner suffered what he described as a “recurrent mood disorder” in the context of ADD/ADHD. He said people who suffer these conditions as children are more likely to develop mood disorders in adult life and he pointed to the fact that Mr Harvey has an understanding that he can be impulsive, compulsive and emotionally reactive as he was in the course of committing the current offence.
	
	
	There was a supplementary report dated 15 December 2015. He said in that report that there would be a direct nexus between the condition of ADHD and the circumstances of the offending. If I could just pause for a moment to reflect upon that aspect of the evidence, just particularly focusing on Mr Harvey. As is well known or should be well known, there are a number of authorities that have discussed the relationship of mental disorders and mental illnesses with offending and the principles to be applied.
	
	
	In the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in DPP v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, his Honour in his usual erudite and succinct way summarised principles emanating from a range of authorities dating back to Scognamiglio and through Engert and later decisions like Israil and Hemsley. Essentially to summarise the position his Honour said that where a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced.
	
	
	I pause for a moment to say that in this case I do not believe the condition underlying much of the prisoner’s behaviour throughout the years, reduces his “moral culpability”, if only for the reason that at this point of his life or at that point of his life four years ago he would have well known both the character of his condition and the capacity he has for impulsive behaviours.
	
	
	The Chief Justice pointed out that persons with a condition that is related to their offending of this type may not be an appropriate vehicle for the message of general deterrence. I accept that proposition without doubt. It is a matter of degree. If one is dealing with a person with an intellectual disability that is profound or a substantial mental illness then, of course, the weight to be given to general deterrence will be in a correlated way reduced in the appropriate case.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept in this matter that there might be some reduction or there should be some reduction to the weight to be given to general deterrence. But, on the other hand, it may be, as the learned Chief Judge at Common Law stated, that the character of the mental abnormality or “illness” may present as making the offender a danger to the community. I do not think the prisoner is a danger to the community but it certainly is a matter that warrants perhaps greater weight to be placed upon “specific deterrence”. For the reason that the prisoner by reference to his criminal history is well aware of his capacity for acting violently in an impulsive way.
	
	
	That having been said it seems to me those matters even themselves out more or less. In this matter there is no suggestion of the prisoner suffering a mental illness or a mental abnormality that makes the circumstances of custody more difficult, as would be the case with a person with a profound intellectual disability or a mental illness such as schizophrenia.
	
	
	That having been said, I note also that the learned Judge pointed out that the mental problems of an offender need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they will be relevant to the sentencing process. A mental disorder of modest severity may well moderate the need for general and/or specific deterrence which actually I accept.
	
	
	In relation to the two offenders there is a common feature in a sense of delay, although it operates in different ways. Delay of itself, of course, is not a mitigatory matter, but it may in combination with other matters be favourable to the sentencing of an offender. One such case was the decision of Todd, (1982) 2 NSWLR 517. There the Court of Criminal Appeal had to consider the appeal of an offender who came back to New South Wales to be sentenced in relation to offending which was contemporaneous with offending in another State, from memory Queensland where the offender was eventually arrested and was required to serve a lengthy term of imprisonment.
	
	
	He came back to New South Wales many years after the offending in circumstances where there had been a path of rehabilitation. Street CJ pointed out that,
	


“Where there has been a lengthy postponement whether due to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier sentence to the circumstance that he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense and to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for sentence on subsequent occasion and to the fact that sentencing him for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls for a considerable degree of understanding and flexibility of approach - passage of time between offence and sentence when lengthy will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence. At times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner.”


	
	This approach was, of course, adopted by the High Court six years later in the decision of Mill. In relation to Mr Todd, of course, that required “undue leniency” being given to him as a matter of “fairness”. In this particular matter, of course, no issue of “undue leniency” arises. But I am required to take into account the effect of delay in this particular sense.
	
	
	In the case of Mr Boye it is to be borne in mind that he has established a life for himself in South Australia, which, of course, is now interrupted by the current proceedings. In the case of Mr Harvey there was, at least, two years of time when he was out of the state with some very minor offending in South Australia which I take into account in his favour.
	
	
	There is another aspect of this matter that works in favour of both prisoners. This is the issue of “uncertain suspense” arising out of delay, part of which was referred to by Street CJ. One of the aspects of delay is the relevance of the conduct of “prosecuting authorities” in that regard.
	
	
	In the case of Mr Boye I note particularly that in April 2012 State Police had a chance to extradite him and they did not. He was not extradited as it turned out for another two and a half years, maybe more, later. That is a matter to take into account. I make no criticism of the Police or the prosecuting authorities, but that is the reality of the situation.
	
	
	In the case of Mr Harvey he came back into the jurisdiction and was in custody. But the determination of his sentence in relation to this matter has been very much delayed by the fact that Mr Boye did not come back into custody until January 2015 and in Mr Harvey’s case his proceedings were put on hold whilst Mr Boye worked his way through the system. That is not Mr Boye’s fault. It has meant that Mr Harvey has been left in a state of suspense because of the need for him to be linked to his co-accused, and I have taken that matter into account as relevant in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	With regard to the submissions of the parties, if I might just deal with some further matters that arise for consideration. Firstly, it was Mr Thomas who probably spent most time on the assessment of the objective facts, although Ms Fernando again skilfully reflected some of the matters raised by Mr Thomas. The Crown did not really submit to the contrary of what was put.
	
	
	The first point to be made was exposed in the discussion I had with all counsel in relation to the matter. As I have earlier pointed out, the use of the implement, that is the didgeridoo, only came about because Ms Cole introduced it into the ‘fight’, if I could use that expression. It was not brought by either of the prisoners to the conflict. I am quite satisfied that neither of the prisoners went to the home to start violence, that the violence that did happen was either to be regarded as spontaneous or reactive or possibly opportunistic, but certainly not pre-mediated or planned. Perhaps ‘impulsive’ might be a way to describe it. It is in that context that I approach what might otherwise be seen to be the inexcusable use of violence by Mr Harvey against a woman, who, even if she had contributed to the heated atmosphere, was simply trying to defend a man who was defenceless on the ground. That having been said, there was nothing pre-meditated about what the prisoner did, he has to be given credit for desisting from a full blow with the didgeridoo, as the facts make clear. He heeded her plea. But it was too late at the time to fully pull out of the blow that was delivered. And it shows, on the part of Mr Harvey, something to his credit, although his other conduct and his involvement in the matter reflects also a loss of control. To be fair, it was not his fight and he got drawn into something that really he obviously was not concerned to be involved in from the start. He was a bystander as Ms Cole got stuck into Mr Boye. On the other hand he should have realised that he should not have got involved, and certainly Mr Boye appears to have been well able to look after himself. But essentially I accept, from what I have just said, much of what was said about these matters by Mr Thomas and Ms Fernando.
	
	
	With regard to some of the other matters raised by Mr Thomas, he said that the prisoner’s moral culpability was low. I accept that that is so in the context of there being lack of pre-mediation or planning. Both he and Ms Fernando submitted that the offending of the prisoners in relation to their respective offences was below the middle range of objective seriousness. I accept that that is for several reasons, including the absence of planning or pre-mediation, the quick period of time over which events developed. The fact that even though there is grievous bodily harm there is no permanent disability, amongst other matters I have pointed out from the facts.
	
	
	I should say in relation to the standard non-parole period relevant to each offence with which I am concerned that I am mindful of the terms of s 54A(2) and s 54B(2) of the Act and, of course, the related principles set out in the 2011 High Court decision of Muldrock. In respect of the issue of the legislation it is to be borne in mind that the Act was amended to, in effect, reflect the findings in the Muldrock decision. Now it is quite clear from the Act that the issue of the middle range of objective circumstances and the standard non-parole is a matter to be concerned with only the objective facts or circumstances of the case. Pursuant to s 54B(2) whatever be the relevant finding of the extent of the objective seriousness the Court has then to factor into the appropriate sentence all the other relevant matters, including relevant, mitigating and subjective issues, as well as, of course, parity issues and the like.
	
	
	There was some debate about what discount should be given to the prisoners covered in both sets of submissions. With regard the matter, Mr Thomas in his opening gambit was somewhat optimistically seeking a discount of 25% on the basis that Mr Harvey pleaded to the alternative charge in each respect for which he is to be sentenced at the first opportunity that the Crown made that available to him. I have borne in mind everything that has been said by Mr Thomas in respect of that matter and also what has been said by the Crown, who enlightened me on some of the history. Likewise, it was put on behalf of Mr Boye that a discount should be certainly greater than 10% or 15% in accordance with the principles laid down in the Thomson and Houlton, guideline judgment in relation to discounts to recognise the utilitarian benefit of pleas of guilty that was handed down by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1999.
	
	
	I have ultimately concluded in the context of the principles in R v Thomson and Houlton, bearing in mind everything that was said and the further information provided by the Crown, that I should accord each offender a discount of 17 1/2 per cent, in the context of them having been committed for trial. I am appreciative of the fact that they may be somewhat captive to the way in which the Crown chose to indict them and the like, but I am not persuaded that I should afford a discount greater than of 17 and a half per cent.
	
	
	I will take into account, as I have pointed out, all the time relevant to the offending spent in custody. In the case of Mr Harvey I have already indicated I will commence the sentence partway through the six months sentence previously imposed on him.
	
	
	With regard the submissions of Mr Thomas concerning general and personal deterrence, particularly reflecting on the mental state of the prisoner, I have already dealt with that issue.
	
	
	Ms Fernando, in her submissions in relation to the facts has put matters to me that I have obviously taken into account. I accept her proposition that Mr Boye and Mr Hutchin exchanged blows in what could be called a “fair fight” and things got out of hand from there that events happened quickly.
	
	
	I bear in mind the ‘in company’ element, as a circumstance of aggravation that is pleaded, only involved two people. I have taken into account all the submissions she put in relation to matters such as the relevance of his criminal history the discount for the plea of guilty and the like. I accept that he has had some disadvantages in his upbringing, although there is no underlying mental condition that explains some of the past conduct of the prisoner. I accept the submission that was put that he has somewhat reconstructed his life in South Australia and I am giving him credit for that.
	
	
	I have taken into account the effect of delay. I have dealt with a number of the matters raised by the Crown because they were somewhat responsive to the submissions of counsel for the accused. The Crown dealt with the issue of the discount for the plea of guilty and the aggravating factors. The Crown submitted in the case of Mr Harvey that there was the aggravating factor of the use of the implement or weapon, the didgeridoo. It is an aggravating factor that arises. Mr Thomas put to me that it is inherently an element of the offence, but the charges brought could be proven without the use of an implement or weapon. It is a limited matter of aggravation in all the circumstances, bearing in mind the use of the weapon arose out of Ms Cole’s introduction of it. I use the term ‘weapon’ in a non-pejorative sense. It is more truly an implement as Mr Thomas said.
	
	
	The fact that the offences were committed whilst the offenders were on conditional liberty is an aggravating factor. The Crown accepted that the fight started as a fair fight. The Crown was concerned about the use of the implement after Mr Boye got the better of Mr Hutchin and I have taken that matter into account. The Crown referred to the criminal histories of the two offenders, he said their prospects of rehabilitation were limited, and that the Court should be circumspect about that, and I agree with that submission.
	
	
	Both counsel submitted that I should make a finding of ‘special circumstances’ pursuant to s 44 of the Act. This was not objected to by the Crown and I accept that submission, in the case of Mr Harvey, in part because of the effects of partial accumulation. But I accept, as I do with Mr Boye, that there should be a period of extended supervision by the parole authority to assist them to return to community living. I believe they both need assistance and guidance in relation to a range of matters, particularly Mr Harvey in respect of drug and alcohol use, and also in relation to matters of employment and the like. Mr Boye has better mechanisms for a peaceful return to the community but he would, as would Mr Harvey, benefit from an extend period of supervision. If they are released at the end of their non-parole periods, the periods of extended supervision should reflect an adequate period for the purposes of supervision to take effect.
	
	
	In sentencing the offenders I have had regard to s 3A of the Act. I bear in mind that the various purposes of sentencing to be taken into account are seven in number, four of which were purposes of sentencing that were discussed in Veen (No 2) in 1988 that the majority of the High Court said were “guideposts” that sometimes “pointed in opposite directions.” By reference to s 5 clearly no penalty other than that of imprisonment is appropriate. The reality is the offenders have been in custody for a substantial time. In sentencing them I note the need to make them accountable and denounce their conduct, recognise the harm done to the victims, as well as the issues of deterrence in its various forms, and seeking to promote their rehabilitation.
	
	
	I do not believe on the facts that either offender is a risk to the community as I do not believe either of them is in a position where the community needs to be protected from them.
	
	
	I have dealt with the aggravating factors that arise under s 21A(2). With regard to mitigating factors I conclude that the offences were not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. I cannot find that the two offenders were “provoked” in the conventional sense as I understand it.
	
	
	In relation to their prospects of rehabilitation my approach to that is guarded but I think that the salutary experience of their extended custody in these matters there is a likelihood they will not re-offend. I am also prepared to accept that, by their pleas of guilty and by their statements to the Community Corrections officers - even though Mr Harvey sees some justification in his conduct - that they are both remorseful for what has happened. Their pleas of guilty are mitigating factors to be taken into account, but for that they receive a discrete discount.
	
	
	Having taken into account all that is required of me, I move to making orders. Mr Harvey please stand up. In relation to count 4 you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of one year three months to commence on 18 January 2014 and will expire on 17 April 2015. The balance of sentence will be one year three months and that sentence will expire on 17 July 2016. The starting point of the sentence in relation to that offence has been discounted by 17.5%. The starting point was three years, six months.
	
	
	In relation to count 2 you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of one year, three months to date from 18 April 2015, to expire on 17 July 2016. The balance of sentence is two years and that will expire on 17 July 2018. You will be eligible for release to parole on 17 July 2016, but that is a matter for the Parole Authority. I do not have the power to direct you be released to parole. The starting point for that sentence is four years.
	
	
	Mr Boye please stand up. In respect of count 2, the common count with Mr Harvey, even allowing for the fact that there are multiple considerations in relation to both of you, I have concluded that you should receive the same sentence. So in relation to count 2 you are convicted, in your case I fix - in respect of that offence - a non-parole period of one year six months. I apologise, I earlier said 30 January 2015 but it is 31 January. That will commence on 31 January 2014 and will expire on 30 July 2016. The balance of sentence is one year nine months and that sentence will expire on 29 April 2018. I cannot direct that you be released to parole as the sentence is in excess of three years. The issues of your parole will be a matter for the Parole Authority.
	
	
	In the circumstances Mr Thomas there is no need for me to make orders about your client’s current custody. I assume that is a matter between he and the authorities.
	
	
	So that you understand the sentences, Mr Boye, your non-parole period will expire on 30 July 2016 and you will be eligible for release to parole on that date. In your case Mr Harvey your non-parole period will expire on 17 July 2016 when you will be eligible for release to parole on that date. Do you understand that?
	
	
	Mr Crown are there any technical matters from your perspective?
	
	
	BAKALIDIS: No your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Thomas?
	
	
	THOMAS: No your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Anything from you, Ms Fernando?
	
	
	FERNANDO: No thank you your Honour - there may be a s 166 certificate that has a matter to be withdrawn.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes you are right. I don’t think I was given a 166 certificate.
	
	
	BAKALIDIS: No your Honour, there isn’t but in terms of Mr Boye there were two matters on a 166 certificate.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes, affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	BAKALIDIS: Yes, they are withdrawn if they have not been.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I dismiss them.  So in relation to the s 166 certificate the matters in relation to Mr Boye - do you have the certificate?
	
	
	BAKALIDIS: I have a copy of it. I also hand up one in relation to Mr Harvey as well. They are not signed.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: No, but for the sequence numbers they are helpful. In relation to Mr Boye the “backup charges” of affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company are withdrawn. One is a back up charge and the other is a related charge but they cover the same matter. In relation to Mr Harvey it is the same position, the back up charge is the assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company, the related charge is affray. They are withdrawn and dismissed.
	
	
	Mr Boye and Mr Harvey I wish you well for the future. I hope for the sake of the community and for your sakes that when you get out of gaol you stay out of situations that could lead to you going back into gaol.
	
	
	Mr Harvey you know as well as I do that you have problems with temper and impulsivity and I know it is difficult in life, feelings of frustration and the like, but you have to control yourself and you know that in personal relationships there are aspects you have to control, and the same with you Mr Boye, this all started with the character of your relationship with Ms Cole. I am not making judgments about anyone, but I know that personal relationships create a strain for people, but you have to understand that the community is very concerned about people acting violently in the context of their personal relationships.

Introduction


	
	On 1 April 2015, Robert John Adams (the accused) was arraigned in this Court before Johnson J. The indictment averred that, on or about 24 September 1983 in Sydney, he murdered Mary Louise Wallace. The accused pleaded not guilty to that single count.
	
	
	Thereafter, senior counsel for the accused notified by way of motion two bases upon which he submitted that foreshadowed evidence in the Crown case should be rejected by me. To state them very succinctly, the first was that foreshadowed evidence said by the Crown to show a tendency on the part of the accused did not pass the test contained in s 101 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (the Act). The second was that evidence about mitochondrial DNA analysis of a hair said to have been located by police in October 1983 in the boot of a motor vehicle owned by the accused did not pass the test contained in s 137 of the Act.
	
	
	The parties (each of whom was represented by senior counsel very experienced in criminal law) jointly submitted that, pursuant to s 192A of the Act, it was appropriate for me to determine those objections (to use a shorthand term) by way of an advance ruling well before the accused is to be arraigned before a jury panel. I accepted that joint submission. Documentary and oral evidence, along with very helpful written and oral submissions, were received by me at a hearing of the motion that extended over several days.
	
	
	This judgment sets out the reasons why I consider that the majority of the tendency evidence is admissible, and that the evidence about the analysis of the hair is also admissible.
	


Crown case


	
	It is convenient first to provide an overview of the Crown case, focusing in particular upon the evidence relevant to the two grounds.
	
	
	In doing so, I shall adopt some conventions for convenience. First, I shall refer to all of the persons who have complained that the accused has sexually assaulted them by pseudonyms. For ease of comprehension of the reader, I shall not use initials; rather, I shall use a name with identical initials to those of the real name of each complainant. Secondly, although it is possible that whether or not Ms Wallace is in truth dead is a matter of dispute between the parties, for convenience I shall refer to her as “the deceased”.
	


Disappearance of the deceased, and its investigation


	
	On the evening of Friday, 23 September 1983, the deceased, then 33 years of age, attended a farewell party at a restaurant in the inner northern Sydney suburb of Crows Nest with work colleagues.
	
	
	At about 1:00 AM on Saturday, 24 September 1983 (in other words, on the same evening), the deceased left the restaurant and walked to the Stoned Crow wine bar, also in Crows Nest. She was accompanied by her friends Mary Williams and Lesley Kennedy.
	
	
	At 2:00 AM, the three of them walked to the Alpine Inn, another wine bar in the same suburb. Before leaving the vicinity of the Stoned Crow, the deceased was assaulted by another man who was not the accused. At the second wine bar, the deceased met the accused, who was then 31 years of age. At 3:00 AM, the deceased entered the ladies’ toilets within the wine bar. She did not reappear for some time. People became concerned about her. At 3:20 AM, the accused told the friends of the deceased that he was a police officer, entered the ladies’ toilets, and proceeded to kick the door open of a toilet cubicle. The deceased was inside that cubicle, and she was well intoxicated by alcohol. The accused offered to take her home. At about 4:00 AM, the deceased was assisted into the motor vehicle of the accused, a Holden Commodore sedan MAA-265. The two of them drove off together.
	
	
	Since that time, the deceased has never been seen again.
	
	
	Later that same morning, the accused attended a champagne breakfast at the home of a friend known as “Duke” in St Leonards, a Sydney suburb very close to Crows Nest.
	
	
	On Sunday 25 September 1983, a flatmate of the accused, Suzanne Beckingham, observed him to be washing the interior and exterior of his Commodore, and also vacuuming it. That was in the driveway of their shared home in the suburb of Chatswood. She also observed him to wash some of his clothes, some bed sheets, and some car seat covers. She made a statement to police to that effect on 2 October 1983.
	
	
	On the same day, 25 September 1983, a neighbour named Barbara Pittman observed the accused sitting in his vehicle with all of the doors of the car and the lid of the boot open. She made a statement to that effect to police on 4 October 1983.
	
	
	On Monday 26 September 1983, the flatmate, Ms Beckingham, noted that the accused was washing the clothes that he had been wearing when he returned to his home on the Saturday. Again, that observation was recorded in her statement of 2 October 1983.
	
	
	On Thursday 29 September 1983, the accused was stopped whilst driving in North Sydney by Detective Inspector Counsel and Detective Senior Constable Matthews. He was arrested on a charge of possessing a small amount of cannabis that the police located in his car, and also on a charge of impersonating a police officer, based upon his statement to others at the Alpine Inn.
	
	
	At Chatswood Police Station, he gave police an oral version of events of having consensual penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with the deceased in the front seat of his motor vehicle after they had driven away together from the wine bar. He believed that he had ejaculated. After that, he said, he fell asleep or passed out in his car. He awoke at about 5:00 AM on the Saturday to find that the deceased was no longer present. He departed the scene, and did not see the deceased subsequently. He had cleaned up some of his semen from his car in the days afterwards.
	
	
	After that, the police undertook a large number of investigations; it is not necessary to detail them here (the evidence about the hair sample is discussed separately below).
	
	
	Many years later, on 20 December 2013, the accused was arrested on a charge of murder at his home in the Sydney suburb of Gladesville. He engaged in a recorded interview with police, in which he confirmed the correctness of what he had told the police many years before in the oral interview of 29 September 1983. He is currently on bail.
	


Seizure of a hair, and its purported analysis


	
	On 6 October 1983 (that is, some days after the disappearance of the deceased), the boot of the car of the accused was vacuumed by Detective Sergeant B J Walsh, a member of the Police Scientific Section. The matter obtained from the boot of the Commodore (“the matter”) was placed in a brown paper bag. Detective Walsh subsequently marked the bag as follows:
	


83/1363

Re missing person

MARY LOUISE WALLACE

Matter vacuumed from boot of Holden Commodore Sed. No. MAA-265

B.J.W – D/Sgt 2/C Chatswood

6/10/83


	
	On 12 October 1983, Detective Walsh created a New South Wales Police exhibit examination form known as a P377. It included the following two references: “Matter vacuumed from boot of Holden Commodore sedan No. MAA-265” and “Matter removed from vacuum cleaner received from Detective Sergeant A. Milroy at Scientific Investigation Section, Chatswood on 6.10.1983”. The latter was a reference to material removed from a vacuum cleaner of the accused, and is not to be confused with the matter from the boot under consideration.
	
	
	On 13 October 1983, Detective Walsh took the brown paper bag and its contents to the Department of Forensic Medicine (DFM) at Glebe for examination. Dr Simon Baxter of the DFM received the material from Detective Walsh. Dr Baxter signed the second page of the P377 form as a confirmation of his receipt of the matter. Dr Baxter made the following marking on the brown paper bag beneath those already made by Detective Walsh:
	


FS83/446-16.


	
	On 10 November 1983, Detective Counsel wrote a two-page report requesting that a comparison be undertaken of the hair recovered from the matter and some hair found on a hairbrush that police had separately located in the residence of the deceased. That request was addressed to Chief Inspector Goulding at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC) at Lucas Heights.
	
	
	Later on that same day, Detectives Counsel and Matthews conveyed a number of items from the DFM at Glebe to the AAEC at Lucas Heights. Chief Inspector Goulding received them at that location from Detective Counsel. The items included a plastic bag marked “Hairs from vacuumings of boot of Commodore MAA-265 – mounted XAM”, which had been created by Dr Baxter.
	
	
	At some indeterminate stage in late 1983, the other items that had remained at the DFM and had not been taken to the AAEC for analysis were returned to Detective Walsh at Chatswood Police Station.
	
	
	At some indeterminate stage in late 1983 or in 1984, Detective Counsel attended at the AAEC and picked up the items that had not been destroyed by the process of examination by Chief Inspector Goulding. Detective Counsel kept any items that he picked up in the same state as he received them from Chief Inspector Goulding.
	
	
	After that, the investigation into the disappearance of the deceased wound down. At some indeterminate stage between 1984 and 2002, the Homicide Squad “returned ownership” of the case to the Detectives’ Office at Chatswood Police Station. All of the items seized in connection with the investigation remained at the Chatswood Police Station exhibit room. Chatswood Police Station temporarily closed in late 2002.
	
	
	On some indeterminate date, some indeterminate person or persons transferred a box containing the exhibits seized in the investigation of the disappearance of the deceased from Chatswood Police Station to Mosman Police Station. The box was labelled by some indeterminate person or persons. It contained, amongst other items, the brown paper bag that contained the material that had been vacuumed from the boot of the Commodore by Detective Walsh,
	
	
	On 17 January 2003 (that is, almost twenty years after the hair was returned from the AAEC), Detective Sergeant Puffett and Detective Senior Constable McKillop attended Mosman Police Station. They searched the exhibit room and located a sealed box of exhibits. Attached to the top of the box was a piece of paper, on which the following words were printed:

	The box was immediately transferred to Manly Police Station. Detective McKillop entered the box into a system of records at that location with exhibit number C-783410.
	
	
	On 21 January 2003, Detective Senior Constable Colver collected all of the exhibits attached to C-783410 from the exhibit room at Manly Police Station. He transported them to the Chatswood Police Station, which had been reopened. They were signed into the Chatswood Crime Scene Specimen/Item Register (CSSIR) as B48877 at 3:45 PM. The exhibits (including the bags in which they were contained) were all individually photographed, bagged, and sealed in clear plastic evidence bags by Detective Colver.
	
	
	The items relevant to the objection that Detective Colver located in the box were a large, empty brown paper evidence bag labelled FS 83/446; a smaller brown paper bag that was labelled identically to the bag that had been marked by Detective Walsh and Dr Baxter many years before; a hairbrush inside a clear, sealed plastic bag marked “brush from bedroom”; and a sealed plastic bag containing grey material marked “FS83/446-17 hairs removed from vacuumings”.
	
	
	Detective Colver completed a further P377 form, which referred to “Matter vacuumed from boot of Holden Commodore Sed No. MAA – 265” as exhibit C783410/1. The item described as “blue hairbrush from bathroom” became C783410/1.
	
	
	On 29 January 2003, Crime Scene Officer Flippence transferred all 13 items from the box from Chatswood CSSIR to the Department of Analytical Laboratories (DAL) at Lidcombe. DAL is a division of the New South Wales Forensic and Analytical Science Service (FASS).
	
	
	On 24 March 2003, Deborah Scott, a forensic biologist employed at the DAL, examined at FASS an exhibit that she subsequently labelled. It was a large brown paper bag labelled “Matter vacuumed from boot of Holden Commodore Sed No MAA-265”. It was itself within a sealed exhibit bag when she received it from the New South Wales police. The brown paper bag itself contained a snap lock bag containing two folded white pieces of material. When opened, those pieces themselves contained such things as dirt, hairs, fibres, and plant material.
	
	
	Ms Scott removed a number of hairs from that matter, examined them, and then placed them in a plastic snap lock bag that she then heat sealed. She labelled it FS 02/5326–5. That bag was then placed in a freezer archive box labelled “Box 5 D.S. March ‘03”. The box was placed in turn inside a freezer in the laboratory at Lidcombe.
	
	
	On 8 September 2003, Sharon Neville, a forensic biologist employed at the DAL, signed a report detailing her examination of the contents of that heat-sealed bag. In a nutshell, she reported that the hairs recovered from the matter vacuumed from the boot of vehicle MAA-265 were unsuitable for nuclear DNA testing.
	
	
	On 12 September 2003, the exhibits were returned from the Sydney Police Centre Crime Scene Section to Manly Police Station.
	
	
	On 22 May 2008, Detective Senior Constable Jones attended Manly Police Station and booked out exhibit C-783410. She opened it, examined and photographed it, re-sealed it, and booked it back into custody on the same day.
	
	
	On 7 April 2009, a review took place as part of a “cold case” investigation into the disappearance of the deceased. There was a discussion about the possible reanalysis of some of the exhibits that had been seized.
	
	
	On 5 May 2009, Detective Jones met with Sergeant Salmon, a crime scene officer, at Manly Police Station. Sergeant Salmon opened the exhibit bags, photographed the contents, and repackaged them. The exhibits were booked into the Manly exhibit section with new reference numbers. In the case of the matter and the hairs from the hairbrush, that was D642287.
	
	
	On 5 September 2013, at the request of police, Dr David Bruce of DAL forwarded the hair sample FS 02/5326-5 (that being said to be the sample that had been obtained from the boot of the Commodore) and the hair sample FS 83/446-7 (that being said to be the sample from the hairbrush of the deceased) to the Australian Federal Police (AFP).
	
	
	On 26 September 2013, Elizabeth Brooks, a senior forensic scientist employed by the AFP, received those two hair samples. Ms Brooks undertook a visual comparison of the two samples on the same day.
	
	
	On 15 November 2013, Ms Brooks forwarded both of the samples to the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine (VIFM).
	
	
	On 6 November 2013, a buccal swab was obtained from the sister of the deceased by Detective Jones. Detective Jones and Detective Bradley booked that sample into the exhibits room at Katoomba Police Station, with a view to sending it to the DAL in due course.
	
	
	On 7 November 2013, Dr Hartman, a molecular biologist employed by the VIFM, received the two hair samples from the AFP and the buccal sample of the sister of the deceased from FASS. Dr Hartmann completed her mitochondrial DNA analysis on 21 November 2013. To state her primary finding succinctly, she found a hair sample, said to have been seized from the boot of the motor vehicle of the accused in October 1983, has a mitochondrial DNA profile identical to that of a hair seized from the hairbrush, which one could infer had been used regularly by the deceased. Furthermore, she expressed the opinion that one in 2,800 members of the Australian community would be expected to have the same mitochondrial DNA profile.
	
	
	On 21 January 2014, the hair samples were conveyed from the VIFM to the Unsolved Homicide Team (UHT). They have remained at the UHT since.
	
	
	To conclude my review of the chronology relating to this issue, Detectives Counsel and Milroy were cross-examined at the committal. They were also cross-examined briefly before me. It is not necessary to detail their evidence above and beyond the review that I have already provided, except to say that it was not disputed at the hearing that, although former Detective Walsh is alive, he is not able to give evidence, due to a debilitating medical condition.
	
	
	To summarise then the salient aspect of the Crown case with regard to the hair sample said to have been taken from the boot, it can be seen that the Crown can generally account for the movement of the matter vacuumed from the boot of the car from October 1983 until November 1983.
	
	
	The Crown can also generally account for the movement of a number of items said to include a hair taken from that matter from January 2003 until today.
	
	
	But the Crown cannot account, in any detailed or coherent way, for the movement or provenance of the hair (that is, the hair that it submits was seized from the boot of the car of the accused in 1983, and was also the hair that was analysed in 2013) between 10 November 1983 (when the items were delivered to the AAEC at Lucas Heights) and 17 January 2003 (when the sealed box was located at Mosman Police Station by two detectives). In particular, where the items went on which dates during that period of over 19 years is shrouded in mystery, as is the question of who placed them in the box, who fixed the two printed labels to the box, and who sealed it.
	
	
	To use an expression well-known to criminal lawyers, the chain of custody with regard to the exhibit that was the subject of scientific analysis cannot be established. The result is that the evidence is by no means conclusive that the hair that was the subject of mitochondrial DNA analysis is indeed the hair that was seized from the boot of the car of the accused. That state of affairs founds the controversy about s 137 of the Act.
	


Proposed tendency evidence


	
	On 17 March 2014, the Crown sent a tendency notice to the solicitors for the accused. Its relevant portions are as follows:
	


1. The person whose “tendency” is the subject of the evidence sought to be adduced is Robert John Adams.

2. The tendencies sought to be proved are:

(a) His tendency to act in a particular way, namely to be sexually violent towards women.

(b) His tendency to act in a particular way, namely to use choking as a method of violence against women.

(c) His tendency to act in a particular way, namely:

a. To meet women either in public bars or cafes by approaching them,

b. To ingratiate himself with these women,

c. To entice them into getting into his vehicle,

d. To use violence, including to place his hands around their throats and apply considerable pressure, for the purpose of forcing them to have sexual intercourse with him, and

e. To only release this pressure if and when the women acquiesced to sexual activity with him.

(d) His tendency to have a particular state of mind, namely to become violent including to the point of strangling a woman if his sexual advances were turned down.


	
	The tendency notice goes on to refer to the evidence that I shall now summarise, again chronologically. I shall also set out very briefly my understanding of the position of the accused with regard to each incident said to demonstrate a tendency on his part (a “tendency incident”).
	


Incident One


	
	The first incident commenced on 4 August 1975. At around 3:00 PM, the complainant, Andrea Hyde, then 28 years of age, was approached by the accused at a café in Circular Quay. He introduced himself as “Bob”. The pair chatted, and arranged to meet the next day.
	
	
	Sometime after 5:00 PM on 5 August 1978, the accused picked up Ms Hyde from her place of work in the Rocks in a car that was a sedan. The accused told Ms Hyde that he was taking her out to dinner, but that he first had to go home to change his clothes. The accused drove Ms Hyde to a suburb of Sydney that she later described as having many large homes, and parked the car off the street. He invited her inside for a cup of coffee. She agreed.
	
	
	The accused led Ms Hyde to a “worker’s cottage” attached to a large home. Once inside, he requested that Ms Hyde have sexual intercourse with him. She refused, and mentioned that she had recently had an abortion and was experiencing some bleeding as a result of that procedure.
	
	
	The accused picked up Ms Hyde, carried her into the bedroom, and forcefully placed her on the bed. He then got on top of her, and began strangling her with both of his hands around her throat. She struggled to breathe, but remained conscious. Fearing that she would be strangled to death, Ms Hyde eventually “acquiesced” to having sexual intercourse with the accused.
	
	
	The accused removed her tights, underpants and shoes, but left the rest of her clothes on. He then had penile/vaginal intercourse with her without her consent. He also forced her to perform oral sex on him. After attempting to have penile/anal intercourse with Ms Hyde, the accused again had penile/vaginal intercourse with her, and ejaculated as a result.
	
	
	Thereafter, the accused instructed Ms Hyde to go to the bathroom to wash herself. He unlocked the door to the cottage, and Ms Hyde quickly ran outside. She left her belongings inside the cottage. She gained the attention of an approaching motorist, and was driven to a nearby Scout Hall. The police were promptly contacted.
	
	
	On that same evening, the police located the accused with the property of Ms Hyde in his bag. After a positive identification of the accused by Ms Hyde in an identification parade at North Sydney Police Station, the accused was charged with rape. The matter was committed for trial in September 1975. However, Ms Hyde fled Sydney before the trial, and the matter was no billed.
	
	
	The position of the accused is that he has never admitted to any offence arising from his interaction with Ms Hyde. He does not dispute, however, her identification of him as the man in whose company she was on the evening in question, and the fact that they engaged in sexual intercourse.
	


Incident Two 


	
	The second incident occurred on 30 May 1976. The complainant, 32 year old Ellen Moon, met the accused at the Skiff Club at Mosman, a suburb on the lower North Shore of Sydney. The accused approached Ms Moon, introduced himself as “Bob”, and asked her to dance. She agreed, and after a short period the pair retired to the veranda of the club to talk.
	
	
	Whilst on the veranda, the accused asked Ms Moon whether she would like to go out to dinner, or go to his house for a cup of tea. Ms Moon declined, and told the accused that she was going home instead. The accused offered to walk Ms Moon to her car, but said that he had to get a jumper out of his own car on the way. They walked to his car.
	
	
	After retrieving his jumper, the accused insisted that Ms Moon get in the front seat of his car. She agreed, and the pair kissed for a short while before the accused drove to a nearby park.
	
	
	At the park, the accused attempted to grab Ms Moon’s breasts. She pushed him away, but he became aggressive. After she voiced her discomfort, the accused put his hands around Ms Moon’s throat and demanded that she hold his penis. She refused, and the accused said, “I’ll count to five and if you haven’t done it I’ll choke you”. He then began to apply pressure to her throat, and asked her to “open your legs” before making the following threat: “Either fuck me now or I’ll fuck you when I kill you, and you won’t be able to talk when you’re dead, I’ll strangle you and throw you in the river”.
	
	
	The accused then had penile/vaginal intercourse with Ms Moon without her consent. He did not ejaculate. Afterwards, the accused told Ms Moon that he had “done a terrible thing”, and asked her to take him to a Police Station. She refused, and he drove her to her car instead.
	
	
	On that same evening, she reported the matter to police.
	
	
	On 31 May 1976, the accused was charged with rape arising from his conduct towards Ms Moon. He entered a plea of guilty to that charge on 6 September 1976. On 28 September 1976, the accused was convicted and sentenced by O’Brien J, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Division, in the Supreme Court at Sydney to imprisonment for six years, with a non-parole period of 12 months. He was released to parole on 18 April 1978.
	
	
	The position of the accused is that he does not dispute that he is the person who interacted with Ms Moon on that evening. It is also part of the Crown case, of course, that he has publicly and solemnly admitted that he raped Ms Moon, by way of his plea of guilty to that offence.
	


Incident Three 


	
	The third incident occurred in late July or early August 1978. The complainant, 20 year old Karen Brown, met the accused at a bar in the North Sydney area. The accused approached Ms Brown, introduced himself as “Bob”, and offered to buy her a drink. Later in the evening, the accused asked Ms Brown whether she wanted a lift home. She accepted his offer, and the two of them left in the white Holden sedan of the accused.
	
	
	The accused drove Ms Brown to an isolated reserve, and locked the car doors. After positioning himself on top of her in the passenger seat, he had penile/vaginal intercourse with her without her consent.
	
	
	Throughout the ordeal, the accused had his hands around the throat of Ms Brown and applied pressure to her windpipe. Fearing that she would be strangled to death, Ms Brown did not attempt to resist the accused. The accused ejaculated.
	
	
	Afterwards, he drove Ms Brown to a house located somewhere near the Pacific Highway in the northern suburbs of Sydney. Ms Brown was then led to a bedroom in the home. There she was raped on a mattress on the floor by the accused on at least two separate occasions. She attempted to escape, but she failed and he pushed her back onto the mattress. Despite her requests to be driven home, the accused refused to allow Ms Brown to leave the confines of the bedroom, even to urinate.
	
	
	The following morning, the accused agreed to drive Ms Brown to Chatswood. From there, she walked to her home. Ms Brown reported what had occurred to the police, but ultimately decided not to pursue the matter.
	
	
	Many years later, she did give the police a further statement. She also engaged in a photographic identification parade and indicated two photographs, one of which is of the accused (I interpolate to say that the Crown prosecutor did not seek to dissuade me from my initial thought that that evidence has negligible probative value). More importantly, however, she gave the police a registration number of the vehicle driven by her assailant that was identical or very similar to the number-plate of a vehicle that could indeed be associated with the accused as at the middle of 1978.
	
	
	The accused disputes the proposition that he is the man who interacted with Ms Brown, and points to a number of discrepancies between what she said to police about the incident as recorded in a report of 7 August 1978, and what she has said in her statement to police of 14 January 2013. In particular, he points to a number of inconsistencies in the description of the man alleged to have sexually assaulted Ms Brown.
	


Incident Four


	
	The fourth incident occurred on 15 September 1978. The complainant, 27 year old Susan Hartman, met the accused at Matches, a bar and discothèque in North Sydney. The accused approached Ms Hartman on the dance floor, and asked her to dance. She accepted his invitation. Shortly thereafter, the two of them went to the upstairs courtyard of the venue and had a drink together.
	
	
	At about 1:15 AM, Ms Hartman told the accused that she wanted to go home. She was intent on catching a taxi, but the accused insisted that he drive her home. A short time later, the pair left the vicinity of the bar in the accused’s white Holden motor vehicle.
	
	
	Upon arrival at her address, the accused stopped the car and asked Ms Hartman whether he could be invited inside. She agreed, and the pair went upstairs to her apartment.
	
	
	Once inside, the accused pushed Ms Hartman to the floor and held her wrists above her head. Whilst on top of her, he said, “I’m going to rape you…do you want to be conscious or unconscious?” After screaming for her housemate (who was not home at the time), Ms Hartman told the accused that she was feeling sick, and needed to be released for a brief moment. The accused did so, and Ms Hartman ran out of the apartment and knocked on the door of a downstairs neighbour, who assisted her.
	
	
	On 17 September 1978, Ms Hartman attended the North Sydney Police Station. After being shown a number of books containing photographs, Ms Hartman possibly identified the accused as her attacker.
	
	
	On 19 September 1978, the accused was charged with the offence of assaulting a female. He eventually entered a plea of guilty, and his lawyer indicated that the plea was entered on the basis that the evidence given by Ms Hartman at committal was correct. On 14 December 1978, the accused was convicted of the offence, and fined the sum of $100.
	
	
	I understand the position of the accused to be that he does not dispute that he is the man who had an interaction with Ms Hartman. Again, the Crown case is that, by his plea of guilty, the accused has formally admitted that he assaulted her, and that he has adopted the correctness of her depositions as underpinning that offence.
	
	
	That concludes my assessment of the Crown case. It is convenient now to turn to the objection about the hair analysis.
	


The evidence about the hair – s 137 of the Act

Submissions of the accused 


	
	The accused conceded that, pursuant to s 70 of the Act, there is some evidence (namely, the labelling of the box and of the brown paper bag containing the hair that was subsequently analysed) that the hair that was analysed in 2013 is indeed the hair that was taken from the boot of the car of the accused in 1983. The section is as follows:
	


70 Exception: contents of tags, labels and writing

The hearsay rule does not apply to a tag or label attached to, or writing placed on, an object (including a document) if the tag or label or writing may reasonably be supposed to have been so attached or placed:

(a) in the course of a business, and

(b) for the purpose of describing or stating the identity, nature, ownership, destination, origin or weight of the object, or of the contents (if any) of the object.


	
	It was not disputed by the accused that it is open to infer that the markings on the brown paper bag were placed there by Detective Walsh. It was also not disputed that it is open to infer that the various markings were placed there and on the box in the course of “a business”, as defined in the Dictionary of the Act.
	
	
	As a result of the operation of the section, it was also accepted by the accused that the evidence of the analysis of the hair in question is relevant, as that concept is defined in s 55 of the Act.
	
	
	As I have said, the focus of senior counsel for the accused was instead upon s 137 of the Act. That well-known section is as follows:
	


137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings

In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.


	
	Turning first to the question of probative value, the accused submitted that, by way of s 70, the contents of the labels constitute some evidence of what was contained inside the box and the paper bag. But it was said that it is by no means determinative, or even particularly powerful, evidence. In other words, it was submitted that the probative value of the evidence is not overly high, particularly in the circumstances that I have outlined of the chain of possession being obscure for a period approaching two decades.
	
	
	The accused accepted that in determining a question of admissibility pursuant to s 137, one must take the Crown case at its highest (in accordance with the decisions of R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 and R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; (2013) 84 NSWLR 363). But the accused submitted that, even if one does so, the evidence suffers from serious deficiencies. In particular, he submitted that one can see from photographs tendered before me that some bags containing exhibits were not properly sealed; that the provenance of some items in plastic bags in the box is mysterious; and that there may well have been contamination of exhibits, even leaving aside entirely the lacuna in continuity.
	
	
	In short, the accused submitted that, even in accordance with the current understanding of how one must approach the question of probative value, it could not be said to be overly high.
	
	
	Turning to the danger of unfair prejudice, there were two bases upon which it was said that there is indeed a significant danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	First, former Detective Walsh (the witness who, on the Crown case, took the sample from the boot of the car and marked the brown paper bag) is not available for cross-examination. Nor can one determine the identity of the person or persons who made any of the other markings that attract the operation of s 70 of the Act. That is so because of the gaps in the Crown case to which I have referred.
	
	
	In short, the evidence of the various markings that support the proposition that the analysed hair of 2013 is indeed the seized hair of 1983 are an exception to the rule against hearsay, and, in the particular circumstances, no one who made those markings will be able to be cross-examined about that hearsay evidence. In other words, the accused will be effectively prohibited from disputing the evidence, or even testing or exploring it.
	
	
	Secondly, it was said that exploring the deficiencies in the chain of possession in front of the jury will be an intricate and time-consuming process. The jury would be tempted simply to say that the hair tested was indeed the hair seized, without properly applying their minds to whether they could truly be satisfied of that proposition. It could well be that any attack on the provenance of the evidence – which would in truth, it was said, be a soundly-based attack – could be seen by the jury as mere quibbling or point taking on the part of the accused. Far from permitting the accused to advance a legitimate criticism of the Crown case, it was said, doing so could actually prejudice the jury against him.
	
	
	In short, it was submitted that the evidence does not possess a high probative value, but on two separate bases it carries a danger of being markedly unfairly prejudicial to the accused. Accordingly it was said that the section is engaged, and therefore I must exclude the evidence.
	


Crown submissions 


	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence is undoubtedly relevant.
	
	
	Separately, it was explained that the Crown thesis in support of the count of murder is that the accused inflicted violence by way of strangulation upon the deceased in order to force her to have sexual contact with him. That proposition is largely founded on the tendency evidence said to support that thesis. But on the occasion of the early hours of 24 September 1983, it was said, he “just went too far”, with the result that his actions caused the death of the deceased.
	
	
	As part of disposing of her body, he at one stage placed it in the boot of the Commodore. Although the accused took steps to clean both the boot and the rest of the car, the hair located by the police and subsequently analysed is indeed, on the Crown theory, a hair of the deceased. The statistics underpinning that proposition and derived from the DNA analysis, whilst not of the utmost magnitude, are certainly not lacking in strength. In short, it was said that the evidence is powerfully probative within the Crown case, understood as a whole.
	
	
	In any event, the Crown submitted that the developing jurisprudence of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal over the past ten years or so establishes that the determination of the true probative value of any evidence is vouchsafed to the jury at trial, not to the trial judge at the stage of objection pursuant to s 137 of the Act. In light of the well-known definition of probative value contained in the Dictionary of the Act, it is for me to judge merely the potential value of the evidence, not its actual value.
	
	
	In short, the Crown submitted that the probative value of the evidence must be assessed by me as high.
	
	
	As for unfair prejudice, the Crown submitted that, in one sense, all admissible, probative prosecution evidence is prejudicial to the interests of an accused person. But it was said that it is perfectly open to defence counsel at trial to attack the relative weakness of the statistic derived from the DNA analysis, and to attack the undeniable gaps in the chain of custody. In short, I interpreted the submission to be that there is no unfair prejudice arising from the admission of the evidence. And, if there were some prejudice in the latter sense of the word, then the position of the Crown was that it would be open to the trial judge to give the jury firm directions not to use or react to the evidence in any prejudicial way.
	
	
	In short, it was said that the evidence is powerfully probative, but gives rise to no unfair prejudice. For those reasons, the Crown submitted that s 137 is not engaged.
	


Determination about evidence of hair analysis


	
	I do not consider that s 137 of the Act is engaged. I say that for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, I agree with the joint position of the parties: the evidence is certainly relevant. The finding of a hair that has a DNA profile consistent with that of the deceased in the boot of the last person known to have seen her alive is relevant to the question of whether that person murdered the deceased.
	
	
	I also accept the joint position that, pursuant to s 70, the representations contained in what was written on the labels on the box and on the brown paper bag are admissible, as an exception to the rule against hearsay, as proof of the truth of their contents. The things that are written on various items are therefore some evidence that the hair that was analysed is indeed the hair that was seized 30 years before.
	
	
	Secondly, I accept that there remains some controversy about what is meant by “taking evidence at its highest” in the context of assessing its probative value when considering s 137 (and indeed s 101) of the Act. But, on the facts of this particular case, I think that taking the evidence at its highest can mean nothing other than proceeding on the basis that the hair that was analysed in 2013 is indeed the hair that was seized from the boot of the car in 1983. That is surely the capability of the evidence, to focus upon the concept encapsulated by the use of the phrase “the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue” contained in the definition of “probative value” in the Dictionary of the Act.
	
	
	At least in the circumstances of this controversy, I accept the submission of the Crown that it is the task of the jury to assess the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. It is not my task. In other words, it is the task of the jury to determine whether they accept that the analysed hair is the seized hair, and in due course whether they accept the further proposition that it is the hair of the deceased. Neither of those decisions is vouchsafed to me.
	
	
	Thirdly, whether the tendency evidence is admitted or not, it can be seen from the summary that I have provided of other aspects of the prosecution case that, on the material placed before me on the voir dire, the position of the accused is that he had sexual intercourse with a woman, whom he had never met before, in his motor vehicle, in the early hours of the morning. Thereafter, she disappeared, never to be seen again, whilst he was unconscious or sleeping. He left the scene and made no enquiries about her whereabouts. There is evidence that, quite soon after that event, he was seen to be extensively cleaning the car in question, including its boot.
	
	
	Even leaving aside all of the tendency evidence for the sake of this discrete exercise, the evidence (taken at its highest), that located in that boot was a human hair that has a DNA profile that is only shared by a reasonably small percentage of members of the Australian population, one of whom is the deceased, is, to my mind, very probative in the Crown case.
	
	
	In short, I consider that the probative value of the evidence must be assessed as being high.
	
	
	Turning to the question of unfair prejudice, I do not identify any that arises.
	
	
	Section 70 is a mechanism whereby Parliament has seen fit to carve out an exception to the rule against hearsay contained in s 59 of the Act. It is true that, in the circumstances of this case, no one can be cross-examined about the tags and labels that are rendered admissible for a hearsay purpose pursuant to s 70 of the Act. But that can hardly be uncommon; in many cases, it will be impossible to identify the person who created the markings and thereby made the representation. Indeed, in the case of mass-produced labels that are attached to items in a factory, for example, it will surely be almost always impossible to determine which particular production line worker attached a particular label to a particular item.
	
	
	And the same may be said about other sections of the Act that constitute exceptions to the rule against hearsay: it is not uncommon for the party against whom the evidence is tendered to be unable to cross-examine anybody effectively about the truth of its contents. An example that springs readily to mind is s 65 of the Act, which renders admissible for a hearsay purpose the previous representations of persons who are, for various reasons, unavailable to be cross-examined.
	
	
	Separately, it is one thing to say that the operation of the section is prejudicial to the interests of the accused; to the extent that s 70 makes admissible previous representations that, pursuant to s 59, would otherwise not be admissible, that is indeed “prejudicial” in a sense to the defence case. But it is another thing to say that the operation of a facilitative section that Parliament has chosen to create gives rise to unfair prejudice. I say that because an accused person has an entitlement to a fair trial according to law; the latter part of that well-known phrase must encompass those aspects of the Act, including exceptions to the rule against hearsay, that operate adversely to him or her at trial.
	
	
	Secondly, I do not accept that a jury will focus on the evidence unquestioningly, and will fail to attend to the evidence of the break in the chain of possession of almost two decades. To the contrary, I consider that senior counsel for the accused will be well able to bring home to the jury, forcefully but concisely, that aspect of the matter, both in cross-examination of police officers and scientists, and in final address. And that will be able to be done in such a way that does not occasion unfair prejudice to the accused. I do not accept that a jury will regard exploration of a period of almost two decades in which the Crown cannot account with precision for the movements of an important exhibit as mere “quibbling” on behalf of the accused.
	
	
	In summary, I assess the probative value of the evidence of the hair analysis as quite high. Although I consider that the evidence is prejudicial in the sense that the accused will not be able to impugn it by cross-examination, that is a result of a choice made by Parliament; the evidence is not unfairly prejudicial. Nor is it unfairly prejudicial for the reason that the jury will fail to attend to criticisms of it; to the contrary, I am confident that the jury will understand and fairly assess the attack made upon it.
	
	
	Because I have not identified any basis upon which the evidence could be unfairly prejudicial, s 137 is not engaged. I therefore reject the submission that the evidence must be excluded pursuant to that section.
	


The objection to the tendency evidence 

Crown submissions


	
	The process of the provision of written and oral submissions very helpfully refined the issues between the parties. My summary of their positions will reflect that refinement, and be concise.
	
	
	The ultimate position of the Crown prosecutor was to accept that it would indeed be very prejudicial for the one jury to hear from all of the tendency witnesses in a murder trial in which it is alleged the accused had sexually assaulted and strangled the deceased. His fundamental submission, however, was that all of the other tendency incidents are so powerfully probative that the test in s 101(2) of the Act is made out.
	


Submissions of the accused 


	
	The accused did not submit that there was any question of concoction (in the sense of deliberate fabrication) occurring between two or more complainants. Nor did he submit that there was any question of contamination (in the sense of any complainant learning of the allegation of another complainant, or hearing about any aspect of the murder allegation, and thereafter unconsciously tailoring her evidence as a result). That means that I do not need to grapple with the difficult questions that can arise in assessing probative value when either or both concoction or contamination is alleged: see, for example, McIntosh v R [2015] NSWCCA 184 at [47] (Basten JA, with whom Hidden and Wilson JJ agreed); Jones v R [2014] NSWCCA 280 at [88] (Bellew J, with whom Gleeson JA and Schmidt J agreed).
	
	
	Senior counsel did submit that the fact that the deceased was assaulted by an entirely separate person outside a wine bar in the inner northern suburbs of Sydney on the evening in question must detract, to some degree, from the force that the tendency evidence is said to have with regard to the murder allegation. I understood him to be saying that the entirely separate assault demonstrated that drunken male violence against women late at night is regrettably hardly unusual, and my assessment of the probative value of the tendency evidence must take into account that fact.
	
	
	Senior counsel submitted that young men meeting young women at licensed premises in the suburbs of Sydney in the evening with an eye to romance and intimacy is also hardly particularly probative or unusual; indeed, it happened and happens constantly.
	
	
	He also submitted that, in truth, there is no direct evidence of any sexual assault of the deceased, or the infliction of any violence whatsoever to her by the accused. In other words, I understood him to be submitting that there is an element of dangerous “bootstrapping” in the effort by the Crown to use tendency evidence to assert that particular things happened between the accused and the deceased when there is no evidence from any other source of those things occurring.
	
	
	He drew attention to the fact that the tendency incidents were by no means uniform. For example, the first incident featured neither a meeting late in the evening in licensed premises, nor sexual intercourse in a car; much of the third incident was in the alleged extended period of detention in a home; and the fourth incident did not feature any strangulation.
	
	
	Senior counsel explained that, with regard to the third incident, there will be a dispute at trial as to whether the assailant was indeed the accused. He submitted that, even allowing for the evidence about the registration plate, the case is not strong, because of the passage of time before the photographic identification, and the internal discrepancies between the descriptions of the attacker, and with the actual appearance of the accused. He submitted that “taking the case at its highest” in accordance with the authorities must be reflected by the proposition that, in highly questionable circumstances, the accused has been said to be the assailant, rather than by the proposition that the accused is indeed the assailant.
	
	
	During discussion, I queried with senior counsel for the accused whether it was possible that the first part of the third incident (including the sexual assault in the motor vehicle) was admissible, but the second part (featuring detention in a home, and repeated sexual assault at that location) was not. Senior counsel disavowed any “fall-back position” in that regard (TT 76.45 [30.7.15]).
	
	
	He emphasised that, whatever directions I see fit to give, there will be a severe prejudicial effect arising from one jury hearing so many serious sexual allegations from other women in a murder trial in which it is alleged a woman was sexually assaulted before death. And he submitted that, on a true analysis, the probative value of the tendency evidence does not substantially outweigh that inevitable outcome.
	


Determination with regard to tendency evidence

Legal principle 


	
	In light of the many decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales and of the High Court of Australia about the admissibility of tendency evidence, I invited the parties to consider whether a summary of the law to be applied by me could be agreed. At the end of the hearing, both senior counsel submitted that the correct approach to the question of “significant probative value” is that recently outlined by Leeming JA (with whom McCallum and R A Hulme JJ agreed) in El-Haddad v R [2015] NSWCCA 10. There, his Honour said at [65]-[72]:
	


[65] The question posed by the statute is what is significant probative value in this context?

[66] In Zaknic Pty Ltd v Svelte Corporation Pty Ltd [1995] FCA 1739; 61 FCR 171 Lehane J formed the view that guidance was available from cases decided before the Evidence Act came into force. I respectfully agree. As much is common ground in New South Wales and Victoria (see Velkoski at [162] and Saoud v R [2014] NSWCCA 136 at [38]). The statutory text did not emerge from a vacuum. Where as here the legislative text is patently open-textured, the immediate context – namely, its replacement of common law rules restricting the use of a particular type of evidence – is especially apt to illuminate its legal meaning.

[67] Lehane J said:

“What is clear is that courts have exercised a considerable degree of caution in admitting similar fact or tendency evidence. They have described the degree of cogency required of such evidence in a number of ways, some at least of which give some guidance, I think, as to the meaning of the concept of ""significant probative value"" which appears in s 97. For example, there are the phrases ""striking similarities"" and ""underlying unity"" seen in some of the criminal cases … It is clear also that where in reported cases evidence of this kind has been admitted, it has been, as a matter of common sense, clearly and strongly probative of the relevant fact in issue …”

[68] To similar effect, in Pfennig v The Queen [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461 at 485, Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ said (emphasis added):

“the evidence of propensity needs to have a specific connexion with the commission of the offence charged, a connexion which may arise from the evidence giving significant cogency to the prosecution case or some aspect or aspects of it.”

[69] The language which has been used to describe the requisite significant cogency was conveniently explained further in Phillips v R [2006] HCA 4; 225 CLR 303, a decision on the position at common law (see at [8]), by a unanimous High Court at [54]. Their Honours referred to “the need for similar fact evidence to possess some particular probative quality”, the requirement of “a strong degree of probative force” and that the evidence must have “a really material bearing on the issues to be decided”.

[70] Accepting as I do that ss 97 and 98 need not equate to the common law test which they replaced, I still regard that background as informing “significant” in s 97. The same appears from DSJ v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 758 at [45]-[46]. “Significant” is directed to the probative value of the evidence. One way in which tendency evidence possesses significant probative value turns on the degree of generality or specificity with which the “tendency” is stated. A tendency which is stated with too high a level of generality will prove a handicap to its having significant probative value. Examples may be seen in Townsend v Townsend [2001] NSWCA 136 at [78], Ibrahim v Pham [2007] NSWCA 215 at [264] and R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306 at [53]. Conversely, “generally the closer and more particular the similarities, the more likely it is that the evidence will have significant probative value”: BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 303 at [108].

[71] Most recently, in Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55 at [40], Hoeben CJ at CL said that:

“One of the difficulties for the Crown in establishing ‘significant probative value’ was the high level of generality of the tendency relied upon. A tendency to have sexual urges was so general as to be meaningless. The additional qualification to that tendency, i.e. to have sexual urges and to act on them in public circumstances where there was a reasonable likelihood of detection, refined the concept but not greatly.”

[72] That is to say, the specificity of the tendency directly informs the strength of the inferential mode of reasoning. It is easy to see why. It is, for example, one thing to say that a man has a tendency to steal cars; that says something, but not very much, as to whether he stole a particular car the subject of a charge. It is quite another to say that a man has a tendency to steal black European sports cars and then set them on fire, if the fact in issue is whether that man stole and burnt a black Porsche.


	
	I am respectfully bound by what the Court of Criminal Appeal said in that judgment, of course, and by the entirety of the exegesis that has been developed by that Court and the High Court of Australia with regard to the relevant sections of the Act over the past 20 years. Nevertheless, in determining this matter I have kept in mind that, in the ultimate, I am simply called upon to apply a straightforward statutory test to the evidence that has been placed before me on the voir dire. That test is contained in the following sections of the Act:
	


97 The tendency rule

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

(2) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:

(a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or

(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.

101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.

(3) This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant.

(4) This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant.

Dictionary

Part 1 Definitions

probative value of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.


	
	In light of the passage of time between the service of the tendency notice and the hearing of the motion, there can be no question about lack of notice. The real point of dispute between the parties was whether the test contained in s 101(2) of the Act is made out. I turn now to discuss the two factors to be weighed by me pursuant that test.
	


Any prejudicial effect the foreshadowed evidence may have upon the accused


	
	It is convenient to discuss this aspect of the matter first.
	
	
	To my mind, the possibility of unfair prejudice if any of the evidence from the other complainants is admitted in the murder trial is extremely high. That is because I consider that, if a jury that is determining whether the Crown has proven beyond reasonable doubt that the accused strangled the deceased as part of the process of sexually assaulting her and thereafter disposed of her body, also hears evidence that the accused sexually assaulted and inflicted severe physical violence upon another young woman or other young women, then there is a great risk that the jury will react emotionally and irrationally to that evidence.
	
	
	That is particularly so if the jury hears from all four tendency complainants: there is the potential for the jury to be simply overwhelmed by the multiplicity of women who are said to have suffered at the hands of the accused. No doubt directions can be crafted by the trial judge to ameliorate that risk to some degree, and no doubt the jury will heed those directions to the extent that they are able. Nevertheless, whatever directions are given, I consider that the possibility of a prejudicial effect upon the accused in those circumstances would be very high indeed.
	
	
	The real question is whether the foreshadowed evidence is so compellingly probative as to substantially outweigh the very significant possibility of unfair prejudice.
	


Probative value of each tendency incident


	
	It is useful to assess the probative value of the evidence of each tendency incident by summarising, first, the facts of the murder allegation, and thereafter, the facts of the proposed tendency allegations.
	
	
	In accordance with well-established authority, I shall analyse the tendency evidence on the assumption that it is accepted by the jury. That includes the evidence in support of incident three; I do not accept the proposition that it can be analysed other than on the basis that the accused was indeed the assailant. To do otherwise, and embark upon my own analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the Crown case in support of that tendency incident would, to my mind, usurp the function of the jury.
	
	
	In short, the Crown case with regard to the murder of the deceased is that the accused:
	


● in the year 1983, when he was a much younger man;

● approached the deceased, a young woman in her early 30s;

● who had been drinking heavily;

● at licensed premises open to the public;

● in the early morning;

● in the inner northern suburbs of Sydney;

● engaged in conversation with her;

● arranged for the two of them to travel in his car, with himself as the driver;

● whilst the car was stationary;

● used violence in order to have sexual intercourse with her;

● strangled her as part of the use of that violence;

● had penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with her;

● ejaculated as a result of that sexual intercourse;

● caused her death by way of the infliction of violence to her person;

● at the time of the commission of the act causing death, possessed one of the three mental elements for murder, or killed the deceased in circumstances amounted to felony murder as then defined; and

● thereafter disposed of the body.


	
	It can be seen that many parts of the Crown case are not disputed by the accused. Indeed, the only factual matters that are really in dispute are the propositions that the accused used violence in order to have sexual intercourse with the deceased; strangled her; caused her death as a result; and disposed of her body.
	
	
	The evidence from Ms Hyde in support of the first tendency incident taken at its highest is that the accused:
	


● in the year 1975, when he was a much younger man;

● approached a woman in her late 20s;

● in commercial premises open to the public;

● late in the afternoon;

● in the centre of Sydney;

● engaged in conversation with her;

● arranged for the two of them to travel in his car with himself as the driver;

● after the two of them entered his home, sought to have sexual intercourse with her;

● used violence in order to achieve that goal;

● strangled her as part of that violence;

● after strangling her, had penile/vaginal intercourse with her without her consent; and

● ejaculated as a result of that sexual intercourse.


	
	The evidence from Ms Moon with regard to the second incident taken at its highest is that the accused:
	


● in the year 1976, when he was a much younger man;

● approached a woman in her early 30s;

● at licensed premises open to the public;

● in the evening;

● in an inner northern suburb of Sydney;

● engaged in conversation with her;

● caused her to enter his car;

● thereafter, whilst the car was stationary;

● inflicted violence upon her person in order to have sexual intercourse with her;

● as part of that violence, manually placed pressure on her windpipe and threatened to choke her;

● at the time of the infliction of violence threatened to inflict death by strangulation of her;

● had penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with her without her consent;

● did not ejaculate as a result; and separately

● the accused solemnly admitted that he had penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with that woman without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting, by way of his plea of guilty to the offence of rape.


	
	The evidence from Ms Brown in support of the third incident taken at its highest establishes that the accused:
	


● in the year 1978, when he was a much younger man;

● approached a young woman who was 20 years of age;

● at licensed premises open to the public;

● that were located in the inner northern suburbs of Sydney;

● engaged in conversation with her;

● arranged for the two of them to travel in his car, with himself as the driver;

● whilst the car was stationary;

● inflicted violence upon the person of the young woman;

● which included manual strangulation;

● inflicted that violence with the intention to have sexual intercourse with the young woman without her consent;

● had sexual intercourse with her in those circumstances in the car;

● ejaculated as a result of that sexual intercourse; and thereafter

● took Ms Brown to a house in the northern suburbs of Sydney; detained her against her will for an extended period; and had penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with her against her will on two further occasions.


	
	The evidence from Ms Hartman in support of the fourth incident taken at its highest establishes that the accused:
	


● in 1978, when he was a much younger man;

● approached a young woman who was 20 years of age;

● in the evening;

● at licensed premises open to the public;

● located in an inner northern suburb of Sydney;

● engaged in conversation with her;

● arranged for the two of them to leave in his car, with himself as the driver;

● asked to be invited inside her home;

● inside the home inflicted violence upon her;

● verbally expressed the explicit intention to have penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with her without her consent;

● referred to the possibility of her becoming unconscious as a result of violence inflicted upon her by himself; and separately

● the accused solemnly and publicly admitted, by way of his plea of guilty to the offence of assaulting a female, that he had unlawfully applied force to the person of Ms Hartman without her consent.


	
	To my mind, the probative value of each of the tendency incidents, even if one analyses each of them entirely on its own and without the context of the others, is compellingly high. The preliminary test in s 97 of “significant” probative value is amply fulfilled by each of them. My summary above makes stark the striking similarities between what is said to have occurred to each of the four tendency complainants, and what is alleged to have occurred to the deceased. And it can be seen that many of the attributes of the Crown case for murder that are not disputed are shared with many of the attributes of the surrounding circumstances of the tendency incidents.
	
	
	It is true that there is no direct evidence, in the Crown case for murder, of sexual assault or the infliction of violence. That is significant, but not determinative. The point of tendency evidence is to infer from the conduct of an accused person on another occasion what he or she has done on the occasion that founds the count in the indictment. Whilst there is force in what senior counsel for the accused has said – namely, that the absence of any direct evidence of important parts of the murder allegation gives rise to a greater potential for “bootstrapping” based upon the tendency evidence – I do not consider that that potential detracts from the compelling nature of the tendency evidence.
	
	
	As I have said, there is no question in this case of concoction or contamination playing any role in the reduction of the probative value of each of the tendency incidents, and therefore any reduction in the role that those incidents can play in reasoning that the accused did indeed cause the death of the deceased in the circumstances alleged by the Crown.
	
	
	Furthermore, if one turns to analyse the four tendency incidents as a whole (by that I mean, in the context of each other, as opposed to individually) the probative value of the evidence is, in my opinion, even more compelling. On the assumption that it is accepted, it certainly demonstrates that many years ago, the accused had a tendency to meet young women; inveigle them into his motor vehicle; and thereafter violently sexually assault them. Indeed, the evidence is redolent of the offender having possessed a settled and specific modus operandi with regard to the infliction of violence upon women for his own sexual satisfaction, or perhaps of him having suffered from a repetitive compulsion in that regard.
	
	
	In particular, manual strangulation can be seen to be an explicit part of incidents one, two and three, and, by way of the reference to the possibility of unconsciousness, as possibly an implicit part of incident four.
	
	
	In short, whether analysed individually or as a whole, I regard the probative value of the tendency evidence as being compellingly high.
	


Evaluative judgment pursuant to s 101 of the Act 


	
	I turn now to assess whether any of the four incidents relied upon as tendency evidence passes the test contained in the section. Again, I shall adopt the approach of first considering each incident on its own.
	
	
	If it were simply a case of the tendency evidence demonstrating that the accused at one stage of his life was in the general habit of sexually assaulting women, I would not be satisfied that such evidence passed the test in s 101 of the Act, in light of the very real possibility of it having a severe prejudicial effect upon the accused that I have already identified: see Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55 at [40].
	
	
	As can be seen from my analysis above, however, the evidence of each incident taken at its highest is far more specific than a mere proclivity to engage in a certain kind of crime. To the contrary, as I have said, the circumstances of each incident are extremely probative as to what may have happened on the evening the deceased disappeared, because of their specific commonalities with the interaction between the accused and the deceased.
	
	
	To my mind, even when analysed strictly separately, the evidence in support of each incident passes the test in the section (leaving aside for a moment the alleged offences against Ms Brown at the house, which form the latter part of incident three). The position is even clearer when the tendency evidence is considered as a whole, that whole being much greater than the sum of its parts.
	
	
	To express my view in terms of s 101 of the Act, I am affirmatively satisfied that the (extremely compelling) probative value of the evidence with regard to each tendency incident substantially outweighs the (undoubted) prejudicial effect that the tender of that evidence will have upon the minds of the jury in the murder trial.
	
	
	The exception to that, to my mind, are the allegations that form the second part of incident three with regard to Ms Brown. The evidence that the accused detained her and repeatedly sexually assaulted her inside a home will certainly be extremely prejudicial in the murder trial. And yet, because it does not share the great particularity that the other tendency incidents share with the interaction between the accused and the deceased, its probative value is substantially less. Whether one examines the second part of incident three individually, or within the context of all of the other proposed tendency evidence, my thought after reflection is that that evidence does not pass the test contained in s 101 of the Act.
	
	
	Having said that, at the hearing, I indicated to both parties, in light of their position that the question of the admissibility of the evidence of Ms Brown could not be divided up, that I would not “consider that ancillary question” (T 76.28 [30.7.15]). It is quite possible that that statement of mine influenced whether the learned Crown prosecutor said anything about the topic in reply. In those circumstances, despite the view that I currently hold, I think that I should not formally reject the second part of the third incident. Apart from anything else, it is possible that there are tactical reasons why senior counsel for the accused would wish the jury to hear it.
	
	
	For the time being, I am content simply to have indicated my current view about the second part of incident three, without excluding it. But if senior counsel for the accused, in light of my other rulings, wishes to re-agitate it, I think he should be permitted briefly to do so (subject to further submissions from the Crown, of course).
	


Conclusion regarding tendency evidence 


	
	To summarise my view about the four incidents relied upon by the Crown as tendency evidence: I accept that there is a very real possibility of significant prejudice to the accused if the jury in the murder trial also hears about those other matters.
	
	
	However, (with the exception of the second part of incident three) I am affirmatively satisfied that, assuming the evidence to be accepted by the jury, many aspects of the admitted interaction between the accused and the deceased are so compellingly similar to many aspects of other occasions upon which the accused inflicted serious violence (on three occasions, including manual strangulation) in order to sexually assault other young women, that the probative value of each of the incidents substantially outweighs the prejudicial effect that it will undoubtedly have upon the accused at his trial.
	
	
	The relevant test having been made out, the evidence is not to be rejected by me.
	


Conclusion regarding both matters


	
	In short, I do not consider that the evidence of the analysis of the hair engages s 137 of the Act. Therefore it will not be excluded.
	
	
	I consider that most but not all of the foreshadowed tendency evidence passes the test contained in s 101 of the Act.
	
	
	The portion that does not pass the test is the evidence of Ms Brown about being detained and sexually assaulted inside a home by the accused. Despite that view of mine at this stage, the evidence will not be excluded for the time being, in light of the position adopted by senior counsel and by me at the hearing.
	
	
	Finally, the matter should return before the Criminal List Judge on the next arraignments day for further determination about future listings and other matters.
	


Rulings and order


	
	I make the following rulings:
	



	
	The evidence about the hair analysis is admissible.
	
	
	The tendency evidence foreshadowed in the tendency notice of 17 March 2014 is admissible.
	



	
	I make the following order:
	


(3)   The matter is listed in the arraignments list on 12 February 2016 at 10 AM.

2768539,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Johnson [2015] NSWLC 31,"Judgment


	
	The offender was charged with the following offences:
	



	
	Common assault (sequences 1, 12, 13, 14) – s 61 Crimes Act 1900 – maximum penalty 2 years imprisonment – charges withdrawn 22/10/15
	
	
	Wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (sequences 2, 3, 5) – s 33(1) Crimes Act 1900 – maximum penalty 25 years imprisonment – charges withdrawn 22/10/15
	
	
	Assault occasioning actual bodily harm (sequences 4, 6, 15) – s 59 Crimes Act 1900 – maximum penalty 5 years imprisonment – charges withdrawn 22/10/15
	
	
	Take and detain for advantage (aggravated) (sequence 7) – s 86(2) Crimes Act 1900 – maximum penalty 20 years – charge withdrawn 22/10/15
	
	
	Destroy or damage property (sequence 8) - s 95(1) Crimes Act 1900 – maximum penalty 5 years imprisonment. Guilty plea entered 22/10/15
	
	
	Enter inclosed lands (sequence 9) – s 4 Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 – maximum penalty $550. Guilty plea entered 22/10/15.
	
	
	Contravene Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (sequence 10) – s 14(1) Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 - maximum penalty 2 years imprisonment. Guilty plea entered 22/10/15
	
	
	Intentionally choke person with recklessness (sequence 16) – s 37(1) Crimes Act 1900 – maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment. Guilty plea entered 22/10/15
	
	
	Reckless wounding (sequence 17) – s 35(4) Crimes Act 1900 – maximum penalty 7 years. Guilty plea entered 22/10/15
	



	
	The offender is to be sentenced for reckless wounding, intentionally choke person with recklessness; contravene AVO, destroy property and enter inclosed lands. The guilty pleas were entered following plea negotiation and the balance of charges withdrawn. The reckless wounding charge was laid shortly before the plea of guilty was entered. It replaced a number of charges. Accordingly, I allow the full 25% discount for the utilitarian value of that plea. The other pleas were not entered at an early opportunity. I allow a discount of 10% for the utilitarian value of those matters - see R v Thompson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and the judgment of Howie J in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32], citing R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117: “the utilitarian value of a delayed plea is less and consequently the discount is reduced even where there has been a plea bargain.”
	


Facts


	
	A statement of facts was prepared to reflect the matters for which the guilty pleas were entered. It was tendered by consent. I proceed to sentence on the basis of what is contained within that statement of facts as the agreed facts (annexed to judgment). For the purpose of these sentencing remarks, I will give a brief outline of those facts.
	
	
	The offender was 22 years of age at the time of the offence. The victim was 19. They had been in a relationship for 6 years but did not reside together. A Final Apprehended Violence Order was in force. In the early hours of 19 May 2015, the offender, victim and others were at the offender’s premises. They had been drinking. The victim was dancing in the kitchen with a male and when the offender saw this, he kicked her between the breasts causing her to stumble backwards through the backdoor, across the veranda onto the ground below. He approached her. She raised her hands to protect herself. He kicked her 3 to 4 times to the hands and head, calling her a ‘slut’ and a ‘dog’. Another woman tried unsuccessfully to intervene.
	
	
	The victim rolled onto her stomach. The offender threw a scooter at her, hitting her in the back of the head, before striking the victim a number of times to the body – despite the pleading of the victim to let her go home. He picked up a small motorbike and threw it at her, hitting her in the back of the neck, then threw something else at her. The offender ran inside and yelled to those present, “Youse wanna fuck off”. He returned to the victim and told her to get up or he would drag her inside, and grabbed her by her hair and shirt dragging her onto the veranda, through the kitchen, and down a hallway to his bedroom. He put her on the floor and walked out. The victim crawled to the toilet where she sat, shaking and spitting blood.
	
	
	The offender armed himself with a small knife, dragged the victim back to the bedroom, threw her onto the bed and stabbed her above the right knee. She fell to the floor in pain. She asked him to stop. He threw a deodorant can hitting her on the nose. He picked up a television set and dropped it on her head.
	
	
	Mr Johnson then retrieved a wooden stick from under the bed and struck the victim to the face as she lay on the floor, continuing to strike her as she covered her head with her arms. She saw that the offender was armed with the stick and the knife and grabbed the stick to stop it being used to beat her. He stabbed her on the knuckles of her right hand, then stabbed her to the left elbow and struck her under the right eye.
	
	
	The offender then used both hands to choke the victim on two occasions, each for about 30 seconds. The victim struggled to breath and was incapable of resistance at that time. In an effort to escape, the victim suggested that they both have a shower. They undressed and sat in the shower. Blood was all over the shower floor. The offender kicked her head and her head hit the tiles. He told her to “fuck off near the bathroom door” and threw items at her striking her in the face. She told him she would get body wash and shampoo, wrapped a towel around herself and left the house. She was dizzy and had difficulty walking and made her way home, though she did not have keys. She heard the offender yell, “I’m gonna hit you. I’m gonna catch up.” Fortunately, the victim managed to hide in the back of a car in the driveway. He yelled, “Come out you motherfucker” and kicked holes in the walls of the house. She fell asleep in the car and was later taken to hospital by ambulance.
	
	
	Police arrested the offender at his home. They observed blood stains on the television, mattress, carpet, door handle and floor. They located a half metre long wooden stick with blood stains and strands of hair on it. They located a knife.
	


Maximum Penalty


	
	The maximum penalties for the offences charged are set out above. With the exception of the offences of enter inclosed lands and contravene AVO, the remaining matters under consideration are ones to which the principles enunciated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115 per Grove J at [35] apply:
	


… where the maximum applicable penalty is lower because the charge has been prosecuted within the limited summary jurisdiction of the Local Court, that court should impose a penalty reflecting the objective seriousness of the offence, tempered if appropriate by subjective circumstances, taking care only not to exceed the maximum jurisdictional limit. The implication of the argument of the appellant that, in lieu of prescribed maximum penalties exceeding two years imprisonment, a maximum of two years imprisonment for all offences triable summarily in the Local Court has been substituted, must be rejected. As must also be rejected, the corollary that a sentence of two years imprisonment should be reserved for a “worst case”.


	
	In R v Merrin [2007] NSWCCA 255 at [36]-[38], Howie J (Giles JA and Fullerton J agreeing) said at [36]:
	


This Court has been at pains to make it clear that sentences for multiple offences are not made concurrent simply because they arise from a single incident of criminality or because they are of a similar nature and committed in similar circumstances.

There will be a degree of accumulation in the sentences imposed in this matter. The principle of totality applies to the matters for which Mr Johnson is to be sentenced as well as the existing sentence being served – see Hiron v R [2007] NSWCCA 336 at [26], citing Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59.


	
	Indication is now given to the offender pursuant to s 53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 that an aggregate sentence is being imposed, with the exception of the enter inclosed lands matter. The offender is currently serving a prison sentence for a number of domestic violence offences committed upon the same victim. As per s 58 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, a sentence that is to be served consecutively with an existing sentence must not exceed 5 years from the commencement of the existing sentence.
	


Assessment of the Criminality


	
	The seriousness of each offence cannot be assessed properly without considering the context of the overall criminal conduct. It is inappropriate for example to consider the choking offence in isolation. It occurred followed a protracted, brutal assault both inside and outside of the offender’s home after the victim had been stabbed three times, beaten, kicked and punched, dragged by the hair and had objects thrown at her and dropped on her. I reject the Crown submission that the choking offence is below mid-range. When considered in context, the offence is extremely serious as the victim was even more vulnerable at the time that she was choked and less in a position to do anything about the attack upon her. The offence is at or above mid-range. The contravene AVO matter is at the top of the range.
	
	
	The victim’s vulnerability is an aggravating factor regarding the choking and reckless wounding matters, within the meaning of s 21A(2)(l) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	The moral culpability of the offender is extremely high. These are serious and significant examples of domestic violence – a scourge that plagues the community.
	


Criminal History of the Offender


	
	The offender has an extensive criminal history which includes personal violence offences committed upon the same victim during the course of their relationship. He has received sentences of imprisonment for his cowardly, dominating and violent conduct. A record involving prior personal violence offences is an aggravating factor (s 21A(2)(d) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act), to which more weight to considerations of specific deterrence and protection will be given (see Hiron at [37]).
	


Offender on Conditional Liberty


	
	At the time of these offences, the offender was on conditional liberty as he was on bail for domestic violence matters against the same victim. The commission of further offences while subject to conditional liberty is a matter of “major aggravation”: for example, see R v Jones (unreported, NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 30 June 1994); R v Wallace [2007] NSWCCA 63. Jones was affirmed by the CCA in R v AD [2008] NSWCCA 289 at [43]. See also s 21A(2)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The current offences occurred 2 months before the victim was due to give evidence against the offender on assault occasioning actual bodily harm and contravene AVO offences.
	
	
	The offender was the subject of an Apprehended Violence Order, where conditions were placed on the offender’s liberty “with the object of protecting against the risk of offences of a particular kind being committed where the potential victim is in position of vulnerability … by their social or domestic circumstances in the case of women or others at risk of personal violence”: Sivell v R [2009] NSWCCA 286 per Fullerton J (McClellan CJ at CL and Schmidt J agreeing) at [29]. However, I err on the side of caution and do not regard the conditions of the AVO affecting the offender’s liberty as an aggravating factor within the meaning of s 21(2A)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	


Matters of General Principle


	
	The offence of reckless wounding involved the use of a weapon which is an aggravating factor - see s 21A(2)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act; Nowak v R [2008] NSWCCA 89 at [16]-[17] and R v Shepherd [2003] NSWCCA 351 at [32] per Kirby J (Meagher JA and Shaw J agreeing).
	
	
	The contravene AVO offence involved gratuitous cruelty through the use of needless yet intentional violence - see s 21A(2)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. This is yet another aggravating factor to be considered in determining an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	Section 14(4) Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act provides:
	


Unless the court otherwise orders, a person who is convicted of an offence against subsection (1) must be sentenced to a term of imprisonment if the act constituting the offence was an act of violence against a person.


	
	In R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302, Johnson J (Hunt AJA and Latham J agreeing) said at [86]:
	


In sentencing a domestic violence offender, and in particular a repeat domestic violence offender, specific and general deterrence are important factors, together with the requirement of powerful denunciation by the community of such conduct and the need for protection of the community. Recognition of the harm done to the victim and the community as a result of crimes of domestic violence is important. 


	
	In R v Edigarov [2001] NSWCCA 436, Wood CJ at CL (Studdert and Bell JJ agreeing) said at [41]:
	


… violent attacks in domestic settings must be treated with real seriousness.… such conduct is brutal, cowardly and inexcusable, and the Courts have a duty to ensure that it is adequately punished, and that sentences are handed out which have a strong element of personal and general deterrence.


	
	In accordance with the authorities cited, the sentences to be imposed in this case will have a strong element of personal and general deterrence.
	


Pre-Sentence Report


	
	The offender was brought up by his foster mother and father, unmarred by issues of significance until 2010 when his foster father died. The offender was 18. There are unresolved issues with drugs and alcohol. His drug use apparently commenced at a very early age. I am not satisfied, nor was it submitted, that these circumstances give rise to considerations known as the Bugmy/Fernando principles - see Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37, and R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 at [62]-[63].
	
	
	Whilst the facts disclose, and therefore I am bound to accept, that the offender was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the offences, there is no credible information that he was also under the influence of drugs – something raised only in the pre-sentence report. The court attendance notice indicates an offence time between 2am and 4am, with time of apprehension 9:25am. There is no mention by police that the offender was drug affected upon arrest. I shall proceed to sentence on the basis of the agreed facts - see Khanwaiz v R [2012] NSWCCA 168 at [94]-[96].
	
	
	It is clear from the pre-sentence report that the offender either lacks or has limited insight into his violent conduct. The report indicates that the offender revealed “an alarming propensity for violence”. There is reference in the report to him “justifying his violence against the victim; victim blaming; limited insight into the impact his violence had upon the victim; and a failure to articulate appropriate victim empathy”. I am not satisfied that any remorse has been demonstrated by the offender.
	
	
	It is hardly surprising that the offender is assessed as a high risk of re-offending. His age is a factor in favour of him being rehabilitated, though I find that his prospects of rehabilitation are guarded at present.
	


Plea in Mitigation


	
	The plea in mitigation mainly focused upon matters raised in the pre-sentence report. It was conceded that the offender’s history does not assist him. Emphasis was placed on the offender’s claimed drug habit, including the use of up to 7 grams of ‘ice’ per day, oxycontin and cannabis. I am unable to make a finding that the offender’s drug use is causally connected to the offences for which he is to be sentenced.
	


General Remarks


	
	In sentencing the offender, the offence of enter inclosed lands is punishable by fine only. For the remainder of matters, and for reasons set out below, I will sentence the offender by way of an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and I will now consider those matters.
	
	
	I have had regard to sections 3A and 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. As indicated above, there is a need for both general and specific deterrence and to make the offender accountable for his actions, to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime(s) and the community and to protect the community from the offender. At the same time, and for reasons previously referred to, I have regard of the need to promote the rehabilitation of the offender. I am of the opinion that no sentence is warranted other than a custodial sentence - see R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [24]-[25].
	
	
	Options of suspended sentences or intensive corrections order are not available for three reasons. Firstly, the offender is currently serving a full time custodial sentence. Secondly, the length of sentence to be imposed will exceed the maximum length of sentence allowable for such options. Thirdly, neither option would be a sufficiently adequate form of punishment to act as a deterrent to both the general public and the offender, per Zamagias at [32]. See also Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45] and [49], and the need to impose an appropriate sentence for each offence, noting that “if additional or greater criminality inherent in the commission of second, third and subsequent offences is to be punished at all, some accumulation of sentences is almost always required”: R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130 at [39].
	


Pre-Sentence Custody


	
	The offender was taken into custody on 19 May 2015. He received a sentence of imprisonment for previous domestic violence offences on 6 August 2015, backdated to 3 May 2015 with an overall sentence of 22 months. His time in custody to date is referrable to his current sentence. Guilty pleas were entered on 22 October 2015 and the matter stood over to 10 December at counsel’s request for the preparation of a pre-sentence report. The sentences to be imposed will date from today, 18 December 2015.
	


Indicative Sentences – s 53A(2)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act


	
	In all of the circumstances, given the facts and the various aggravating and mitigating factors as I have found them to be, I am of the opinion that the criminality for each matter is deserving of the sentence indicated below, having applied the discounts set out above for the utilitarian value of the guilty plea in each case, as follows (note that none of the offences are subject to a standard non-parole period, and accordingly, non-parole periods are not specified – s 44(2C) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act):
	



	
	Seq. 8 destroy/damage property: 10 months
	
	
	Seq. 10 contravene AVO: 21 months
	
	
	Seq. 16 choke: 2 years (noting that a head sentence exceeding 2 years (i.e. 2 years 3 months) would be appropriate, but recognising the jurisdictional limit of this court as 2 years, as per Doan)
	
	
	Seq. 17 reckless wounding: 2 years (noting that a head sentence exceeding 2 years (i.e. 2 years 9 months) would be appropriate, but recognising the jurisdictional limit of this court as 2 years, as per Doan)
	


Aggregate Sentence and Special Circumstances


	
	I have had regard to the various propositions regarding aggregate sentencing emerging from legislation and cases are set out in JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [39] per R A Hulme J, and McIntosh v R [2015] NSWCCA 184.
	
	
	I make a finding of special circumstances per s 44(2B) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act noting his age, and his need for drug and alcohol rehabilitation upon his release. The offender’s drug use commenced at an age when he was unable to make free choice as to the consequence of its use: see discussion in R v Henry & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 111. The court is not required to reduce the non-parole period where the importance of general deterrence requires that the non-parole period not be reduced: see R v Stone (1995) 85 A Crim R 436 at 443 (per Sully J, Levine J agreeing). The importance of general deterrence in these matters is clear. In fact, consideration has been given to the potential need to increase the non-parole period, as in Veen v The Queen (No. 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. Notwithstanding that, and considering the principle of totality, the non-parole period will be reduced on the basis of a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 75 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act, whereby the offender has pleaded guilty to domestic violence offences (see s 11 of the Act), I vary the existing final order for the purpose of providing greater protection for the person against whom the offences were committed. The AVO is extended for a period of 5 years with the existing conditions unchanged.
	


Orders


	
	The offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years to date from 18 December 2015 concluding on 17 December 2019.
	
	
	The non-parole period is 2 years and 6 months, commencing 18 December 2015 and expiring 17 June 2018 upon which the offender will be eligible to apply for parole.
	
	
	In relation to the enter inclosed lands offence (sequence 12), a conviction with no further penalty is recorded pursuant to s 10A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

		23 June 2016",2015-12-17 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2768540,State of New South Wales v Anderson (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 1970,"Judgment


	
	By Summons filed on 6 October 2015 the State of New South Wales (“the State”) seeks orders against the defendant, Ronald James Anderson, under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (""the Act""). The orders sought are for the defendant’s continuing detention and thereafter his extended supervision or, alternatively, for his extended supervision. The orders sought are set out at [5] to [9] of the Summons.
	
	
	The principal order sought is a continuing detention order (“CDO”) for a period of 12 months pursuant to s 17(1)(b) of the Act, followed by an extended supervision order (“ESO”) pursuant to s 17(1)(a). In the alternative, an ESO is sought for a period of 5 years.
	
	
	At the time the State initiated proceedings the defendant was in custody serving a sentence of imprisonment for offences of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	The sentence for that offence expired on 17 October 2015. The defendant served the whole of its term due to the refusal of the State Parole Authority to order his release to parole.
	
	
	The matter came before Hamill J on 12 October 2015 so that the question of interim orders could be determined. In a judgment delivered on 15 October 2015 his Honour made an order under s 15(4) of the Act appointing Doctors Andrew Ellis and Jeremy O'Dea to conduct separate examinations of the defendant and prepare psychiatric reports for the Court. Justice Hamill declined the State’s application to make an interim detention order, but granted the alternative prayer, and made orders subjecting the defendant to an interim supervision order (“ISO”) pursuant to s 10A of the Act, to commence from 17 October 2015: State of New South Wales v Anderson [2015] NSWSC 1515.
	
	
	On 11 November 2015 Adams J made an order under s 10C(2) of the Act renewing the ISO until 10 December 2015: State of New South Wales v Anderson (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1679. On 8 December 2015 Schmidt J made a further order renewing the ISO until 6pm on 6 January 2016: State of New South Wales v Anderson (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 1871
	
	
	At the hearing of the application for final orders before me, the State tendered and relied upon extensive documentary evidence setting out the defendant’s history and circumstances as relevant to the risk it contends the defendant poses to the safety of the community. In addition, oral evidence was called from three forensic psychiatrists who have examined the defendant recently for the purposes of making an assessment of the risk he poses or may pose to the community. Each of Dr Ellis, Dr O’Dea, and Dr Richard Furst gave evidence before the Court on 14 December 2015.
	


The Statutory Framework and Threshold Criteria


	
	It is important when considering an application made pursuant to the provisions of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) to have regard to the purpose and objective of the legislation, and the reasons for its enactment by the Parliament.
	
	
	The legislation was enacted in 2006 as a means by which the community could be protected against what were referred to by the Minister in the second reading speech in the Legislative Assembly on 29 March 2006 as “a handful of high risk, hard-core offenders” who had done nothing towards rehabilitation whilst in custody serving a sentence.
	
	
	Initially, the legislation was confined to serious sex offenders, but it was later extended to apply additionally to violent offenders: Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Amendment Act 2013 (NSW).
	
	
	Section 3 of the Act sets out its objectives:
	


“3 Objects of Act

(1)    The primary object of this Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of high risk sex offenders and high risk violent offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community.

(2)    Another object of this Act is to encourage high risk sex offenders and high risk violent offenders to undertake rehabilitation.”


	
	The principal concern of the Act is with ensuring the safety and protection of the community; a secondary purpose, subordinate to that of the protection of the community, is in encouraging high risk offenders to engage in rehabilitation.
	
	
	The Act comprehends the fact that offenders who are serving or have served any sentence imposed by a court, may be detained in custody beyond the expiration of the sentence, or subject to supervision by the State, with the consequence that an individual’s ordinary right to liberty is restrained.
	
	
	Part 1A of the Act provides for the supervision of high risk offenders, be it high risk sex offenders as defined in s 5B of the Act, or high risk violent offenders as defined by s 5E. Division 2 of Part 2 deals with the determination by the Court of an application for an extended supervision order, whilst Division 2 of Part 3 contains the corollary provisions with respect to an application for a continuing detention order. Sub-sections (3)(a) to (3)(i) of s 9 and ss (4)(a) to (4)(k) of s 17 provide for a number of matters which the Court must have regard to when determining applications under the Act. The first of the mandatory considerations (s 9(3)(a); s 17(4)(a)) is the safety of the community.
	
	
	The State may apply for an extended supervision order or a continuing detention order against any person to whom the definitions of sex offender or violent offender in s 4 apply: s 5H; s 13A.
	
	
	The defendant is a person to whom the definition of sex offender applies, in that he is a person over the age of 18 years who has been sentenced to imprisonment following his conviction of a serious sex offence. The serious sex offence is an offence contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) in respect of which the defendant was imprisoned until 17 October 2015.
	
	
	A ""serious sex offence"" is defined in s 5(1) to include an offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) where the offence is punishable by imprisonment for 7 years or more. Division 10 deals with “offences in the nature of rape, offences relating to other acts of sexual assault etc” and includes offences contrary to s 61J, to which a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment attaches.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 13B of the Act the State’s principal application, for a continuing detention order against the defendant, can only be made in respect of a detained sex offender or a supervised sex offender. That criteria is met, in that at the time the Summons was filed on 6 October 2015 the defendant was a ""detained sex offender"", being in custody in a correctional centre serving a sentence of imprisonment for a serious sex offence: s 13B(2)(a)(i).
	
	
	The time limits imposed upon an application of this nature by s 13B(3) are also satisfied.
	
	
	The State’s application specifies that the continuing detention order sought is a high risk sex offender continuing detention order, and provides relevant supporting documentation. Accordingly, the requirements of s 14 of the Act have been met.
	
	
	An extended supervision order may be made if the defendant is a ""high risk sex offender"": s 5C(1). A continuing detention order may be made if the defendant is a ""high risk sex offender"" and the Court ""is satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order"": s 5D(1).
	
	
	The Court must determine whether the defendant meets the criteria for characterisation as a ""high risk sex offender"" as set out by s 5B of the Act:
	


“5B High risk sex offender

(1)    An offender can be made the subject of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order or a high risk sex offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk sex offender.

(2)    An offender is a high risk sex offender if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(3)    The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence.”


	
	The Act provides no definition of what is meant by “an unacceptable risk” but, having regard to the object of the Act (s 3), the language used in s 5B(2), and the ordinary meaning of the words, the legislature must have intended the statutory test to be satisfied where the evidence establishes that there is a risk that the defendant will commit a serious sex offence which is sufficiently high that the making of an order is necessary to protect the community and ensure its safety: State of New South Wales v Thomas (Preliminary) [2009] NSWSC 1119; State of New South Wales v Thomas (Final) [2011] NSWSC 307, both being decisions of R A Hulme J; as applied in State of New South Wales v Graeme Allan Reed (Preliminary) [2011] NSWSC 625; and Attorney General for New South Wales v McGuire [2015] NSWSC 152. The question is whether the safety and protection of the community cannot be ensured unless an order is made.
	
	
	In Director of Public Prosecutions WA v Williams [2007] WASCA 206; (2007) 176 A Crim R 110 at [63], Wheeler JA, with the agreement of Le Miere AJA, said of comparable legislation in Western Australia:
	


“In my view, an “unacceptable risk” in the context of s 7(1) is a risk which is unacceptable having regard to a variety of considerations which may include the likelihood of the person offending, the type of sexual offence which the person is likely to commit (if that can be predicted) and the consequences of making a finding that an unacceptable risk exists. That is, the judge is required to consider whether, having regard to the likelihood of the person offending and the offence likely to be committed, the risk of that offending is so unacceptable that, notwithstanding that the person has already been punished for whatever offence they may have actually committed, it is necessary in the interests of the community to ensure that the person is subject to further control or detention.""


	
	There is no real dispute that the defendant is a high risk sex offender, and I am satisfied of that to the high standard specified by s 5B(2) of the Act.
	
	
	The question is whether a continuing detention order is necessary for the safety and protection of the community, as the State contends, or whether, as the defendant submits, the Court should find that an extended supervision order will provide adequate supervision of the defendant, and ensure the community’s protection.
	


The Defendant’s Circumstances and History of Criminal Offending


	
	The defendant is currently aged 50 years, having been born in February 1965. He has three adult children to two previous relationships. He currently has very limited family contact, and has had minimal contact with his family over the past many years.
	
	
	The defendant has an horrendous criminal history that has led to him spending much of the last 30 years of his life in custody, serving sentences for various offences and, significantly, for offences of extreme violence, including the index offences of aggravated sexual assault.
	
	
	The defendant left school at the beginning of year 8 and found employment for a time. He commenced his long involvement with the criminal law in 1982 with convictions for assault and possession of drugs, dealt with in the Local Court. The assault was committed against a 16 year old boy whom the defendant believed had informed against him to police for a larceny offence. The boy was punched twice in the face and once in the stomach. On arrest, the defendant told police, ""He asked for it and got what he deserves”.
	
	
	In 1983, at age 18 or 19, the defendant was convicted of offences of goods in custody and three break, enter and steal matters, again dealt with in the Local Court. The latter offences were apparently committed to obtain money for drugs, although the defendant told Dr Furst that he engaged in them to spite his father.
	
	
	In 1984, there were further convictions for break, enter and steal, driving without a licence, failure to appear and a breach of recognisance. Custodial sentences were imposed.
	
	
	In 1985, the defendant was again before the criminal courts, and was sentenced for further drug offences and a further false pretences offence. Two years later, in 1987, when the defendant was 22 years old, he was convicted of assaulting a female and released on a two year recognisance. The woman concerned was the defendant’s then partner, whom the defendant pushed to the ground and punched with sufficient force as to cause a wound to her eye that required sutures.
	
	
	Later in that same year, and in breach of the two year recognisance he was subject to, he was convicted in the District Court of the offences of supplying a prohibited drug and cultivating prohibited plants. Another period of imprisonment was imposed.
	
	
	The defendant was also convicted in 1987 of a number of offences of stealing, break, enter and steal, failing to appear and possessing a prohibited drug. He was sentenced to a number of terms of imprisonment, served concurrently with the longer term of imprisonment imposed by the District Court for the drugs offences.
	
	
	On release from custody in 1990, the defendant was convicted of offences of unlawful entry, failure to appear, assault occasioning actual bodily harm (“AOABH”), four counts of break, enter and steal, and seven counts of false pretences. He received various prison sentences. The AOABH offence was committed against a five year old boy, the son of the defendant’s then partner. The defendant lost his temper with the child and “kneed” him in the torso. The child sustained a broken rib and bruising. There was also facial bruising although the defendant denied injuring the boy’s face.
	
	
	In 1992, the defendant was convicted of an offence of escaping lawful custody and sentenced to a short period of imprisonment.
	
	
	In 1994, he was convicted of two offences of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and, on each count, was sentenced to a minimum term of seven years and six months and an additional term of two years and six months. These sentences reflected very grave offences of violence involving the use of two knives with which the defendant armed himself against two individuals known to him. The defendant himself described the offences as ""nearly killing two people"", and that was an accurate description for what were vicious crimes. After having stabbed the first man, the second victim pleaded with the defendant to calm down. Having done no more than that, he was then stabbed by the defendant, who told him, “Die you little cunt”. At the time of these offences the defendant was subject to both parole and bail.
	
	
	The sentencing judge (Ducker QC DCJ) in his remarks on sentence described these crimes as “a serious outbreak of violence” which the defendant himself initiated.
	
	
	An appeal against the purported severity of the sentences imposed for these offences was later dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal: R v Anderson (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), James and Finlay JJ, 19 October 1994, unrep).
	
	
	The defendant was serving the sentences imposed by Ducker QC DCJ when he escaped from custody and committed the index offences and other serious crimes.
	
	
	There appear to have been other, unrecorded incidents of serious violence by the defendant.
	
	
	In an undated self-report the defendant gave, as recorded in a document entitled “Violence Prevention Programme, Malabar Special Programmes Centre” (Tab 109 of Volume Two of Exhibit EW-1), he described other, uncharged acts, including cutting a friend with a razor and taking the friend’s money, tying a victim to a four-wheel drive and dragging him from the vehicle in a dispute over cannabis, and assaulting a friend with a baseball bat.
	


The Index Offences


	
	The facts of the offences committed by the defendant following his escape from custody make for chilling reading. They are indeed terrible crimes. I do not intend to set out the facts here in all of their graphic and unsettling detail; they can be found in the remarks of the sentencing judge, Bellear DCJ, of 14 December 2001, and in the judgment of the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal which later heard and upheld a Crown appeal against the leniency of the sentences imposed at first instance: R v Anderson [2002] NSWCCA 304.
	
	
	In brief, the facts are as follows.
	
	
	At some stage on the night of 28 February 2001 or the morning of 1 March 2001, the defendant and a fellow prisoner escaped from Grafton Correctional Centre. The following day they travelled to Sawtell Beach. The defendant and the co-offender observed the victim, a 50 year old woman, walking towards her car. She was a stranger to them. The defendant and his co-offender attacked the victim as she was walking along a track and dragged her into the bushes. She was assaulted and her mouth was covered by tape to stop her from screaming for help. Her hands were bound with a cord and a piece of rope.
	
	
	She was carried to the car the offenders had stolen and put into the rear seat. The victim’s terror was understandably extreme; she believed that she would be killed or tortured.
	
	
	She was taken to an isolated area in a State Forest and pulled from the car. Her clothes were forcibly removed and, naked, she was pushed onto the boot of the car. There the defendant and his companion took turns in forcing penile-vaginal intercourse upon the victim. She was threatened with being stabbed with a pair of scissors, and told that the offenders would ""fill [her] full of holes"" and that ""we could slit your throat.""
	
	
	The victim was also forced to have oral sex with the defendant before she was returned to the back seat of the car. Whilst the co-offender drove at speed through the bush, the defendant forced further acts of penile-vaginal intercourse upon her.
	
	
	Troublingly, the defendant and the co-offender told the victim that they had broken out of jail and had “fucked up” their lives. They told her that there was no hope for them and they may as well “enjoy” the night.
	
	
	The victim was then driven to another location where the defendant again forced penile-vaginal intercourse upon her in the car. She was removed from the car and subjected to further sexual indignities by the co-offender, whilst the defendant kept a look-out.
	
	
	The victim was also robbed of her purse, and was forced to assist the offenders by using her bank card to withdraw a sum of money from her bank account.
	
	
	After an extended ordeal, the offenders left their victim in a town. She was subsequently taken to Coffs Harbour District Hospital. Setting aside the psychological damage, which is likely to have been both significant and long lasting, the victim was found to have numerous abrasions and extensive bruising to her arms, back, neck, wrists and face.
	
	
	On 14 December 2001 in the Sydney District Court the defendant was convicted of escape lawful custody, together with a number of offences arising from the events at Sawtell, being:
	



	
	steal motor vehicle;
	
	
	aggravated sexual assault (in company);
	
	
	detain for advantage and cause injury to victim;
	
	
	aggravated sexual assault (inflict actual bodily harm); and
	
	
	aggravated robbery (infliction of actual bodily harm and deprivation of liberty).
	



	
	As is plain from the facts of the offences that I have set out, these offences were, at least in relation to the sexual crimes, representative to a degree, in that not all of the multiple acts of intercourse were reflected by a specific charge.
	
	
	Part of the material before the sentencing judge was a report of 8 September 2001 from a psychologist, Ms Robilliard, whose findings included that the defendant had a ""deeply disturbed personality construct"", and a ""markedly antisocial aggressive disposition and a lack of emotional and interpersonal sensitivity."" The psychologist also concluded that the defendant’s ""presentation and personality profile and his record of offences implies that he is dangerous, and he is strangely aware of that himself.""
	
	
	In its judgment following the Crown’s appeal against the sentences imposed by Judge Bellear, the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal said this:
	


“His Honour [the sentencing judge] accurately described the conduct of the Respondent and his co-offender as: ""despicable, atrocious, dehumanising acts against the one female, who appeared absolutely helpless throughout the ordeal."" The terror induced in the victim and the physical abuse to which she was subjected over a sustained period of time, indicated that the offences of aggravated sexual assault were of the highest gravity.” ([20] per Spigelman CJ, with whom Adams and Blanch JJ agreed)


	
	The Court also gave some prominence to evidence before the sentencing Court from Ms Robilliard, in her September 2001 report. In the judgment, Spigelman CJ said (at [39]):
	


“It is worth noting some of the results of the psychological testing in the report before his Honour where, inter alia, the psychologist concluded:

""This combination of attributes describes an individual who would have little genuine interest in others and very little depth of feeling. Emotional closeness, warmth and intimacy would be uncomfortable and solitary pursuits more attractive.”

""The combination of Anti-social and Aggressive personality attributes indicates a capacity to behave in a cruel, malicious and callous fashion. The expression of anti-social feelings will be overt, direct and abusive. Humiliating others is a mechanism for relieving his own psychological pain. Relatively unaffected by punishment, he would be capable of reckless and anti social acting out.""

""Schizotypal and Schizoid elevations together indicate an apathetic, detached individual who will be deficient in his capacity to experience emotion. Inherently emotionally unstable, rapid and extreme mood swings from euphoria to intense irritability, anger and destructiveness would be consistent.""


	
	The sentences imposed at first instance which, in respect of the two offences of aggravated sexual assault, were terms of imprisonment of six years and 11 years respectively, were held by the Court of Criminal Appeal to be manifestly inadequate. In coming to that conclusion the Court was cognizant of the defendant’s criminal history:
	


“This disgraceful record of anti-social behaviour, demonstrating escalating violence, is such as to indicate that considerations of personal deterrence were entitled to substantial weight in the sentencing exercise. There is also the element of protection of the community, which was entitled to weight, particularly in the light of the psychologist's report, indicating that this particular offender remained a danger to the community.” (at [32])


	
	The Court ultimately quashed the sentences imposed at first instance in relation to the two s 61J offences (with other sentences confirmed), and re-sentenced the defendant as follows:
	



	
	For the offence of aggravated sexual intercourse in the motor vehicle whilst it was being driven along a bush track at speed, sentence the Respondent to a fixed term of six years imprisonment to commence on 18 October 2002 and expiring on 17 October 2008.
	
	
	For the offence of aggravated sexual intercourse on the boot of the car, sentence the Respondent to a head sentence of eleven years commencing on 18 October 2004 and expiring on 17 October 2015 and fix a non-parole period of six years to commence on 18 October 2004 and expiring on 17 October 2010.
	
	
	For the offence of escape from lawful custody, a fixed term of two years commencing on 18 October 2010 and expiring on 17 October 2012.
	



	
	The variation to the sentences was in the degree of accumulation imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The overall sentence was one of 13 years, with a non-parole period of 10 years specified.
	
	
	It is noted that the principle of double jeopardy applied to these proceedings. Chief Justice Spigelman noted the applicability of the principle, commenting at one point that a starting point of something of the order of eighteen years would have been appropriate (at [47]).
	
	
	The finding of Bellear DCJ that special circumstances existed pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) such that the usual statutory ratio of sentence was varied in the defendant’s favour was undisturbed on appeal.
	
	
	As it happens, because of the defendant’s conduct in custody and, in particular, his unwillingness to meaningfully and consistently engage with rehabilitative programmes directed at his violent and sexual offending, the defendant served what was intended to be an extended period of supervision in custody, being released only at the expiration of the total sentence on 17 October 2015.
	


Offences Whilst in Custody


	
	Over the years the defendant has spent in custody he has accumulated over 30 institutional misconduct charges, together with a number of criminal convictions (for possessing drugs in custody). His custodial history from the Department of Corrective Services (dated 12 June 2015) is less than encouraging, and is suggestive of a continuing attitude of defiance to authority.
	
	
	The most recent reported incident was for obstructing a correctional officer on 24 October 2014, for which the defendant received a reprimand and a caution. He has a number of entries for failing a urine test or having drugs in urine, the most recent being from March 2014. There are entries for fighting, possessing weapons, using abusive or insulting language, damaging property, refusing a urine test, and a number of other offences.
	
	
	The entries for fighting appear to reflect some serious incidents. The defendant confessed to Dr Ellis (who noted it in his report of 20 November 2015) that he would “belt blokes who committed sex offences, and would hurt them bad”.
	
	
	Not noted on the list of institutional misconducts but significant nonetheless is the defendant’s acknowledged possession and consumption of a prohibited drug in October 2015, a drug he used after the State’s application for an interim order was heard before Hamill J, but before his Honour gave his judgment. The defendant’s use of Buprenorphine, of which his Honour was unaware, was detected by urinalysis conducted just after the defendant was released from custody.
	


The Defendant’s Views of the Index Offence & Response to Custodial Treatment Programmes


	
	Whilst the defendant pleaded guilty to the index offences and, in that sense, has taken responsibility for them, he does not seem to have accepted that he is a sexual offender.
	
	
	Although the defendant has not always or consistently been forthcoming about his motivation for the commission of these offences, he has explained it previously as anger and a desire for revenge. One could add to that the fatalistic idea expressed to the victim of the index offences that, since he would be further imprisoned for escaping from Grafton Gaol, he may as well “enjoy” his time out of prison, albeit at the expense of another person.
	
	
	A Custody Based Treatment Programme (“CUBIT”) treatment report of 6 April 2011 records the defendant’s explanation of his escape and the subsequent offences as connected to his belief that his then partner was or had been unfaithful to him. He experienced feelings of intense anger and wanted revenge against both his partner and the man with whom she was involved. This led to the sexual offences, with the defendant displacing the aggression he wished to visit upon his partner to the victim, a complete stranger.
	
	
	To senior psychologist Kristy Murphy in an interview in January 2015, the defendant reported that he did not know why he committed the index sexual offences (Risk Assessment Report of 28 January 2015). Ms Murphy nevertheless concluded (at [47]) that “It appears likely that Mr Anderson's high level of anger and possible threat to his sense of self is strongly related to his sexual offending.""
	
	
	In his report of 3 August 2015 Dr Furst recorded (at p.10) that the defendant found it difficult to articulate the reasons for his sexual offending in 2001. He told the doctor:
	


“I think it was sheer frustration. At the time I was filthy on women. My relationship breakdown. I felt betrayed and robbed ... [because of wife] cheating and lying. It was a snowball effect. I didn't know how to cope. I took my anger out on an innocent.”


	
	The defendant also said: ""I'm [at] a loss to explain why it happened, why I allowed it.""
	
	
	More recently, to Dr O'Dea, the defendant said (as recorded by the doctor, with his ellipses, at [46] of his report of 27 November 2015):
	


“... I got to Sawtell just before dusk ... because the offence happened just around dusk ... she was 51 I believe — just coming back up from the beach to the car park ... I didn't plan it... it just happened ... my idea of being out of prison was to go for [a] swim ... have a chop ... and see my mum ... I don't know why I did it... I'm not gunna to say something for the sake of it.”


	
	The defendant also told Dr O'Dea that he had been “in a bad place” at the time, having had a relationship break down, and had resorted to using “a lot of gear”. He referred to the victim of the sexual assaults as “an easy victim”, someone to take his anger out on.
	
	
	Notwithstanding those apparent partial insights, the defendant has not responded entirely positively to treatment programmes offered to him whilst in custody.
	
	
	The defendant does not seem to understand or accept that he is an individual who poses a risk of sexually reoffending. In an interview with Ms Murphy, whose Risk Assessment report of 28 January 2015 is in evidence, the defendant said he would not offend in the same way again and questioned the “moderate – high” risk assessment made of him following his participation in the CUBIT programme. He regarded his sexual offences as an anomaly ([46] of Ms Murphy’s report). The defendant told Dr Furst there was “no risk” of him sexually offending in the future (p.12, report of 3 August 2015).
	
	
	Ms Murphy concluded that:
	


“Mr Anderson has appeared to develop a level of intellectual understanding in terms of how his behaviour, thoughts and feelings may influence his unhelpful and general criminal behaviours (Senior, 04/04/2011). The engagement in some of his risk factors post completion of the CUBIT program, the limited insight at time displayed and the tendency towards globalised management strategies in terms of addressing the risk factors, suggest limited emotional acceptance and commitment to managing these risk factors. It appears that Mr Anderson genuinely does not wish to return to custody however his current skill set in terms of promoting his good life goals and managing his risk factors requires ongoing development and practice.”


	
	The limited insight Ms Murphy referred to is perhaps reflected by the defendant’s initial unwillingness to engage in sex offender treatment programmes whilst in custody. It was initially necessary for psychologists at Goulburn Correctional Centre to engage in therapy with the defendant that was directed to improving his motivation to participate in such programmes.
	
	
	Thereafter, in June 2009 the defendant agreed to enter relevant programmes, but he refused a placement in CUBIT offered to him later that year.
	
	
	The following year he agreed to participate in a preparatory programme, taking part between 3 June 2010 and 29 July 2010. His participation was described as excellent, and motivated by his realisation that he had to engage with treatment initiatives to be considered for release to parole ([52] of Ms Murphy’s report).
	
	
	Subsequently, the defendant took part in CUBIT, between 13 August 2010 and 4 April 2011. The results were somewhat mixed. His level of engagement was said to be high, and he developed some insight, but the defendant had difficulty in exploring aspects of his sexual offending, and he was on occasion hostile and intimidating to those involved (CUBIT Treatment Report of 4 January 2011; [53] – [55] of the report of Ms Murphy).
	
	
	It was noted that the defendant had some cognisance of “triggers” leading to violent or other problematic behaviour, but was not able to implement strategies to divert such behaviour quickly enough, or at all in relation to his drug use.
	
	
	At later monthly maintenance group meetings the defendant was regarded as hostile, uncommunicative, self-focused, and “entitled”. Despite being advised that participation in maintenance programmes would be advantageous when being considered for release to parole, the defendant attended only four meetings, refusing thereafter to engage at all in maintenance therapy.
	
	
	It is noted that Dr Furst regards full participation in a maintenance programme as an essential preliminary step to the defendant’s re-entry into the community (p. 3 of report of 3 August 2015).
	
	
	Ms Murphy noted the defendant’s comments to her about regarding therapy of this nature as no more than a “hoop” that he had to be seen to jump through if he was to achieve his liberty. She characterised the defendant’s understanding of the risk he poses, and his awareness of risk management strategies, as “only intellectual and somewhat superficial” (at [57] of the report of Ms Murphy).
	
	
	The defendant’s apparent ability to express sentiments or demonstrate conduct perceived by him as necessary to gain his liberty is a feature in the evidence that is frequently repeated and noted. It is a matter of some concern to me and I will return to it.
	
	
	Although illicit drug use has been identified as a clear risk factor for the defendant in engaging in serious criminal conduct, there is a weight of objective evidence that suggests that this is not an area that the defendant has successfully tackled. As previously noted, he returned a positive test for prohibited drugs on 17 October 2015, the day of his release from custody. On his own account, the defendant had taken eight or nine “points” of Buprenorphine, or “bup”, in the days prior to his release. He has not returned a positive test result since 17 October 2015.
	
	
	Ms Murphy has identified the possible consequences of substance abuse by the defendant as including disengagement with supervision, reduced capacity to regulate his emotions, an increased risk of problematic behaviour, and thoughts of entitlement. All of these factors in turn add to the risk of a return to serious sexual and other offending.
	


The Defendant’s Response to the ISO


	
	On 17 October 2015 upon his discharge from custody the defendant was taken by Corrective Services staff to the Nunyara Community Operated Support Programme Centre (“COSP”) where accommodation had been arranged for him. In accordance with the orders made by Hamill J the defendant was fitted with an electronic monitoring device. A drug test administered that day revealed the presence of Buprenorphine, as noted above.
	
	
	The defendant was introduced to staff whose role was to support and supervise him. He presented as fit and well and motivated to obtain employment. He expressed a desire to move away from Sydney in the long term, settle in a regional area, and obtain work on a rural property
	
	
	During his weeks at the COSP the defendant was an enthusiastic cook, cooking meals for other residents, and enjoying that role. The defendant was subsequently given full time work as a gardener at the Centre and spoke with his mother about suitable plants for the garden.
	
	
	Steps were taken to establish the defendant with Medicare, Centrelink, and other agencies and service providers. He obtained a telephone and an opal card for public transport. He attended to personal shopping and other ordinary day-to-day activities.
	
	
	His progress at the COSP was generally satisfactory. There was an incident when a drug detection dog indicated a scent on the defendant’s clothes, but nothing can be drawn from such a vague occurrence in my view. A number of searches of the defendant’s room and person, conducted at random during his residence at the COSP, found nothing of any concern.
	
	
	Apart from an expression of some anxiety about coping in the community made by the defendant to one of the psychiatrists, his time spent at the COSP was exemplary.
	
	
	On 18 November 2015 the defendant moved from the COSP to a granny flat in the western suburbs of Sydney operated by Providential Homes. His progress was sound. He rapidly became involved in work with Providential Homes, working in the kitchen and supervising others in the preparation of large numbers of meals. He made a commitment to work in the kitchens on an unpaid basis until Christmas. His work and input was well received and valued, although there was some level of disharmony between the defendant and a female worker, which the defendant felt he resolved.
	
	
	The defendant made contact with family members, including his mother, sister and an aunt. Some tentative plans were made for the accused to travel to the north of the State to spend Christmas with his family, although their plans were deferred when the defendant became anxious about it. He additionally had the commitment to Providential Homes.
	
	
	The defendant had a meeting with an aunt which he felt had been awkward and uncomfortable.
	
	
	The defendant expressed the wish to meet his children, but also felt considerable anxiety concerning the prospect of engaging with them.
	
	
	Throughout his time in the community the defendant attended meetings of Narcotics Anonymous, and regular counselling sessions with psychologists. His engagement was positively received.
	


The Psychiatric Evidence


	
	The Court had the benefit of reports from three forensic psychiatrists who have assessed the defendant, Doctors Furst, Ellis and O’Dea, supplemented by oral evidence from each. Each of the doctors were provided with the same comprehensive documentary evidence as was tendered to the Court in support of the State’s application.
	
	
	There is broad agreement amongst the doctors that the defendant is someone who attracts diagnoses of an Anti-Social Personality Disorder (“ASPD”) and a Substance Abuse Disorder.
	
	
	Dr Furst saw the defendant on two occasions, 26 June 2015 and 17 July 2015. He obtained a full history from the defendant, which is summarised in his report of 3 August 2015.
	
	
	Dr Furst characterised the defendant as co-operative with assessment but somewhat abrupt, as lacking emotional depth, and shallow in affect.
	
	
	Having reviewed the information concerning the defendant’s history of criminal conduct Dr Furst noted that his offending behaviour had commenced at an early age (15 years) and the defendant’s conduct over the years was indicative of anti-social attitudes, poor control over behaviour, poor emotional control, attitudes of aggression to others generally, and substance dependence.
	
	
	At p.15, Dr Furst concluded that:
	


“[…] it would appear that Mr Anderson’s primary psychiatric diagnosis is one of an antisocial personality disorder, schizoid traits and/or psychopathy [with the Hare Psychopathy Checklist being necessary to ‘diagnose’ the latter]. In any case, his callous disregard for the female stranger victim in 2001 offences and the two male victims in the earlier 1994 grievous bodily harm offences are ominous indications that speak to the dangerousness of Mr Anderson.”


	
	The doctor also referred to traits other than the antisocial personality disorder, such as being “somewhat self-entitled or mistrusting as a personality style” (T49: 37-38). Anger or a feeling of being slighted was a trigger for violence:
	


“[…] there's what appears to be an association between him being wronged or slighted or him being upset about somebody or something and then using violence or other means like sexual violence as a means of revenge.” (T51:16-19)


	
	No diagnosis of paraphilia was made.
	
	
	Dr Furst regarded the defendant’s substance abuse disorder as a continuing difficulty, demonstrated by the defendant’s recent resort to a prohibited drug, buprenorphine. As to that recent lapse, the doctor said,
	


“Well I guess it needs to be considered in the context of someone who appears to have an addiction disorder or a substance use disorder and who, according to the Justice Health notes and his self report, was using buprenorphine without prescription back in 2013 and 2014 and possibly at other times. I'd need to go through the whole files again. But it's a sign, I would suggest, it's a sign that the problem has not gone away and is an ongoing issue.” (T50: 14-20)


	
	The doctor regards the defendant’s substance abuse disorder and his recent resort to buprenorphine as a risk:
	


“[…] it's a general risk. I mean it's clear that a lot of his offences in his background were committed in his adolescent or early twenties for drug related reasons such as procure money for drugs essentially, and also it would appear that when he escaped lawful custody at the time of the index offences, he reported the use of amphetamines at that time and then in the years that have gone by there's ongoing issues in terms of drug use in custody , so it's a risk and just without reference to his particular history, drug use in general is a risk factor for violence, that's widely accepted.” (T50: 32-39)


	
	The defendant has not repeated drug use since his release to the community on 17 October 2015, and Dr Furst regarded that, together with his compliance with supervision more generally, as a positive first step. However, he cautioned that the eight or so weeks the defendant has spent in the community without incident has to be viewed in the context of his history of anti-social conduct, lengthy incarceration, and institutionalisation. He expressed the view that eight weeks in the community was too short a time to draw any firm conclusions.
	
	
	Whilst the defendant’s positive response to supervision since 17 October 2015 caused Dr Furst to reconsider his opinion as to the length of time over which the defendant should be detained subject to a CDO, it did not cause him to view supervision in the community as sufficient to ensure that the defendant did not reoffend.
	
	
	He continues in the view that, even with supervision, the defendant belongs to a group of offenders at high risk of committing a further a sexual offence:
	


“So what I mean, the concern there is that he's willing either impulsively or otherwise to inflict a lot of damage on victims in these events and has done so, and the best predicator of future dangerousness and offences is usually past offending and that's why I said that's an ominous indication of the future dangerousness.” (T52: 45-49)


	
	Dr Furst concluded that there was real advantage in the defendant being detained for a year pursuant to a CDO, identifying the benefits as providing an opportunity for the defendant to undertake the maintenance programme he had refused to complete, and to experience a more gradual transition to community life, through undertaking a programme of day release from custody.
	
	
	He expressed significant concerns that, even if supervised under the proposed conditions of an ESO, the defendant probably posed an unacceptable risk to the community:
	


“..the concern I have clinically from a psychiatric point of view is that Mr Anderson has had very limited time out of custody throughout his adult life, and there's indications in the report of Dr Ellis that he's experienced some anxiety in the case notes, he has experienced some anxiety being in the community after such a long time. Clinically that type of anxiety could be a trigger for drug use, for example, or being frustrated or acting out if he is sufficiently stressed. If it was done in a more graded fashion, which you might see in forensic rehabilitation of forensic patients, there's usually a greater system of leave and release, rather than having someone's leave and have less structure around them, and I think structure is very important for Mr Anderson.

………

The concern I have with him is more that he may act impulsively or if intoxicated or stressed, without thinking a great deal about much at all.” (T54: 29-39; T57: 27-28)


	
	Dr Ellis saw the defendant at interview on 26 October 2015, that is, some nine days after his release from custody. At the time of interview, the defendant was residing at the Nunyara COSP and subject to the interim supervision order imposed by Hamill J.
	
	
	Dr Ellis also took a thorough history from the defendant, recorded in his report of 20 November 2015. The defendant presented as co-operative although frequently resorted to profanity. He answered the doctor’s questions and expressed some remorse for his past actions, although Dr Ellis noted that the defendant’s expressions of remorse were qualified. The defendant expressed his willingness to be subject to an ESO, commenting that it would be a “good thing” (p.11 of the report).
	
	
	Like Dr Furst, Dr Ellis concluded that the defendant has an ASPD and a substance abuse disorder. As to the former the doctor noted,
	


“There may be some attenuation and modification occasioned of this personality style as he has aged, however this has yet to be tested outside of the structure of the prison. Personality disorders are chronic conditions but do tend to ameliorate in intensity over time.”


	
	Features of an antisocial personality include impulsivity, failure to plan ahead, aggressiveness, violence, disregarding the rights of others, and a failure to conform to social norms.
	
	
	The doctor further commented upon the consistent correspondence of anti-social personality orientation with sexual re-offence, noting that an anti-social “pattern of interpersonal function has been entrenched across his [the defendant’s] adult life” (p.14). Because the defendant had not yet demonstrated “sustained maturation of his interactional style” Dr Ellis concluded that the defendant needed on going treatment to continually address personality function.
	
	
	As to the substance abuse disorder, Dr Ellis commented that such disorders are “chronic, relapsing conditions” (p.12). The acquisition of drugs was regarded as a strong motivator for the defendant’s behaviour, with the use of such substances increasing impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and anger, and impacting negatively upon the defendant’s maladaptive cognitive processes and his underlying ASPD.
	
	
	In terms of the defendant’s engagement with treatment and other rehabilitative programmes, Dr Ellis noted that the defendant’s participation appeared to have been mixed. Consistent with the observations of other clinicians and forensic psychiatrists, Dr Ellis observed that:
	


“His general interactional style indicates an intellectual level of insight into his behaviour that he can repeat in a script like fashion to clinicians. In some cases this has been assessed as genuine understanding. It is likely however that he does not have the ability to incorporate this understanding in an emotional and motivational sense to put the understanding into sustained change at this point.” (p.15)


	
	Dr Ellis regarded the defendant as having the capacity to pronounce those sentiments of most benefit to him, albeit without genuinely adopting them. He warned,
	


“That's another thing in terms of risk management that supervising people need to be aware of, that he's got that potential to present himself in a light that might look like remorseful and insightful and wanting to change.” (T10:23-25).


	
	The doctor considered the history of the defendant’s interaction with psychologists and clinicians, and noted earlier expressions of remorse and a wish to rehabilitate from the defendant that turned out to be illusory.
	
	
	From a psychological report of March 1988 from C Drayden-Thompson (at tab 106 of Volume 2 of Exhibit EW-1):
	


“Mr Anderson says he doesn't want to go back to gaol, et cetera, in part because he's missing out on being with his daughter who is now nearly four but mostly because he's missed out on a normal life. He said that in the last couple of years he'd been able to control his anger and he was trying to handle things differently.”


	
	In 1999 the defendant attended counselling sessions and acted as a facilitator in a mentoring programme (Tab 108 of Volume 2 of Exhibit EW-1). His contribution was positively received:
	


“I've been impressed with his sincere presentation both in groups and in observation of him as a mentor.”


	
	In another report of a similar nature, made in February 2000, only very shortly before the savagery of the index offences, the defendant was referred to thus:
	


“Appeared motivated throughout contact to address issues of attitude and anger.”


	
	Dr Ellis commented that the defendant:
	


“… can present as showing insight and showing motivation to some practitioners … But that also indicates a level of ability to give supervising people the impression that he is doing well when he may not be.” (T19:34-37)


	
	Dr. Ellis concluded that the defendant:
	


“[…] would fall into a group of persons with a risk for serious sexual offending […] that is statistically moderate to high in frequency, of a type with serious consequence, and greater than a theoretical average offender. Specific treatment and supervision would likely reduce the risk.” (p.15)


	
	The defendant’s performance in the community since release and whilst subject to the ISO was regarded as a positive first step, although too short in duration to be a clear predictor of future conduct, particularly when set against the defendant’s lengthy history of dysfunctional and violent conduct.
	
	
	Dr Ellis regarded the key factor for the defendant’s conduct as his anti-social personality disorder, intertwined with his history of sexual and other violent offending. These were noted to be the factors most associated with future sexual offending (T4:31), with anger as a causal feature of both violent and sexual offending. Dr Ellis opined that “there would be a similar risk of a serious violent offence as to a serious sexual offence” (at T5:41), and a “moderate to high risk of committing a serious sexual offence” (at T5:45).
	
	
	The doctor saw some benefit to a CDO, being the capacity to attend a psychological programme directed at violent offenders, and the ability to undertake sex offender therapy maintenance, together with supervised leave in the community, but he noted that there is no evidence that lengthier incarceration has a positive impact on rehabilitation, or recidivism.
	
	
	Overall, although Dr Ellis conceded that minds could reasonably differ, he thought that close supervision in the community could reduce the risk of sexual and violent reoffending. He agreed however, that there remains a prospect that the defendant could, regardless of the level of supervision in the community, commit a serious sexual offence that could occur rapidly, and with catastrophic result.
	
	
	Like Dr Ellis, Dr O’Dea saw the defendant after his release from custody, on 28 October 2015. Similarly briefed to Drs Furst and Ellis, he took a history from the defendant and assessed him relevant to risk of the commission of serious sexual offending. He too noted the defendant’s capacity to portray himself in a positive light when he perceived it as advantageous to him to do so (at [67] of his report of 27 November 2015), specifically referring to the defendant’s attempt in interview with him to convey empathy, contrition and remorse in relation to the index offences, which Dr O’Dea regarded as “somewhat superficial” (at [77] of his report).
	
	
	At interview, the defendant was co-operative, although Dr O’Dea noted “flashes of anger” (at [77] of his report) at times. Having interviewed the defendant and considered the voluminous documentary record, Dr O’Dea concluded that the defendant has a Substance Use Disorder and a Personality Disorder with anti-social and psychopathic traits.
	
	
	He noted the defendant’s lack of empathy and callousness, and observed that his repeated history of offending was despite sanctions, incarceration, and supervision in the community. The doctor opined that the defendant’s pattern of substance abuse is one that is resistant to change, as is the nature of his dysfunctional interpersonal relationships, which are characterised by violent interactions with others.
	
	
	Commenting (as each of the forensic psychiatrists did) that the best predictor of future sexual offending is past sexual offending, Dr O’Dea thought that there was a significant risk that the defendant would engage in further sexual offending long term in the community without close supervision.
	
	
	He described the defendant as a man with very poor emotional and sexual controls and noted that, if he was placed in an opportunistic circumstance, he could readily “act on his sex drive without bringing into play important social and interpersonal constraints” (T45:21-22).
	
	
	Critical to preventing further offences in the doctor’s opinion was total abstinence from prohibited drugs and alcohol and close supervision in the community. Like Dr Ellis, Dr O’Dea thought that further time in custody was unlikely to alter the defendant’s risk profile, or appropriate risk management requirements.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea made the same observations as did Drs Furst and Ellis as to the defendant’s capacity to project an appropriate image of himself when it was of use to him to do so. When asked in evidence about the defendant’s expressions of remorse he said:
	


“Rather I think I'd want to take his overall explanation in detail which points from my perspective to the fact that of course it's now 14 years ago; he's been through a lot of psychological treatment programs in custody and the explanation he gives for the offence is still one that doesn't to me anyway put him in the central focus of responsibility for what he did and it may, some of the things he spoke about are things that are not uncommonly canvassed in psychological treatment programs as the approach they take to understanding sex offending, and the sense I got is that some of that he may have been repeating without really giving me a sense that he understood what that perspective on sex offending is and how it relates to him.” (T37:39-48)


	
	He referred at (T38) to the defendant as “rehearsing the talk”, without meaningfully understanding the sentiments, or genuinely experiencing them.
	
	
	As to the prospect of supervision in the community adequately managing the risk posed by the defendant, Dr. O’Dea opined that a risk management plan could potentially provide for adequate and appropriate management of the defendant. He said:
	


“[…] he seems to be managing better in this period than he has across his period in custody. But of course we're looking at a much greater period in custody than here.” (T47:4-6)

Is Supervision Enough?


	
	The principal question for the Court to determine is whether adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order, such that a CDO should be made, as sought by the State. There is no issue that the defendant meets the threshold criteria in the Act and is a ""high risk sex offender"": s 5C(1). The issue that is in dispute is whether that risk can be managed in the community, formally, the question posed by s 5D(1).
	
	
	Having carefully, indeed anxiously, considered all of the evidence, I am not satisfied that supervision in the community pursuant to an ESO is adequate.
	
	
	The defendant has a lengthy history of significant offences of violence. That history alone, coupled with his failure over the years to respond to any form of restraint and supervision imposed upon him by the courts (such as bail, bonds, and parole) suggests that he poses a significant risk of serious sexual and other violent re-offending.
	
	
	The assessment undertaken of that risk assesses the defendant as presenting a moderate to high risk of sexual recidivism by reference to both static and dynamic risk factors. Whilst such assessments can hardly be a precise science, the weight of the evidence here suggests that the assessment is entirely justified.
	
	
	The weight of the psychiatric evidence is that his history in that regard derives to a great extent from his anti-social personality disorder, compounded by his substance abuse disorder. All of the psychiatric experts who gave evidence agreed that ASPD is a disorder which is treatment resistant and enduring. Whilst maturation may ameliorate the severity of the manifestation of the disorder, that is not necessarily so. At age 50, the defendant may have gained a degree of maturity, however there is no real way to judge that at the present time, particularly in light of his relapse into drug use as recently as mid-October 2015.
	
	
	A substance abuse disorder is also a chronic condition, with sufferers prone to relapse, as the defendant so recently did. Relapse in the defendant’s case could lead to catastrophic results.
	
	
	Although the forensic psychiatrists do not necessarily accept that insight is critical to rehabilitation – perhaps contrary to the perception of the criminal courts - it is accepted by them that the defendant has limited insight into his sexual offending. Such a lack of insight must at least have some impact on the defendant’s capacity to judge risk for himself, and thus to have recourse to protective behaviours.
	
	
	Additionally, his lack of insight is likely to contribute to his demonstrated unwillingness to undertake treatment programmes.
	
	
	Because of his refusal to fully engage in rehabilitative programmes whilst in custody the defendant has not had the full potential benefit that complete engagement offered; certainly Dr Furst believes that it is important that the defendant completes custody based maintenance programmes. His failure to undertake such programmes both adds to the risk posed by the defendant, and points to his continuing non-compliance.
	
	
	The defendant’s lack of compliance had another outcome not envisaged when the defendant was sentenced by the primary judge and resentenced by the Court of Criminal Appeal, that being the absence of a period of transition to parole, and then extended parole. Both courts structured the sentences imposed upon the defendant in such a way that it was anticipated he would have access to an extended period of supervised parole, with the usually precedent day release programmes a corollary, to aid him in the transition from institutional life to life in the community. That did not occur, and there is a very real possibility that the transition is too stressful for the defendant to cope without resort to drug use or other unproductive and risky behaviour.
	
	
	Since the evidence is that the defendant's sexual offending is probably linked to his high level of anger and violent response to any perceived threat to his sense of self, there must be a danger of the defendant becoming angry in the community as a result of the many minor slights and small injuries that can be experienced in daily life. Without the skills to mitigate such feelings, there is a clear and continuing risk of sexual recidivism.
	
	
	That the defendant used illicit drugs as recently as mid-October 2015, when judgment regarding the State’s application for an interim detention order was reserved, indicates clearly his continuing inability to comply with prohibitions on drug use, and remain drug-free. Any relapse into illicit drug use renders the defendant vulnerable to anti-social behaviour, and the community vulnerable to the consequences, consequences which, on the defendant’s history, can be severe.
	
	
	The defendant’s compliance with the ISO is a positive feature of his case which he relies upon to argue that an ESO will provide adequate supervision for him and adequate protection for the community. Whilst I do not dismiss his positive conduct lightly, and am concerned at possibly halting or adversely affecting the defendant’s rehabilitation, I have viewed his period of compliant conduct and positive work history in light of three factors. They are, the longstanding and apparently deeply entrenched nature of the defendant’s anti-social conduct; the treatment resistant nature of the disorders from which he suffers; and the defendant’s well documented capacity to present an acceptable, if completely superficial, self-image to others when he thinks there is benefit to him. I am very troubled by the likelihood that the defendant’s recent compliance is no more than a manifestation of his desire to remain out of custody, and would evaporate as soon as that end had been achieved by this Court making an ESO.
	
	
	I have given consideration to the fact that community based rehabilitation would or may benefit the defendant to a greater extent than custodial treatment, and to the potentially negative consequences to the defendant’s rehabilitation should he be returned to custody.
	
	
	Although the evidence is that individuals ordinarily respond better to community based treatment programmes, the differential, on the evidence, is very small. That potential benefit to the defendant’s rehabilitation is outweighed in my view by the risk he poses to the community. Whilst I accept that continuing detention may have no rehabilitative effect, nor will it have any adverse effect on the defendant’s rehabilitation (Dr Furst at (T59), it will however, serve to fully protect the community. The legislation mandates the primacy of the safety of the community.
	
	
	The defendant has demonstrated a capacity to sexually offend in a most serious way, without regard to legal restraint or the restraints of common humanity, with disastrous and likely life-long consequences for his victim.
	
	
	The gravity of the consequences of the risk posed by the defendant manifesting is very high indeed. Even if the risk of the defendant committing a serious sexual offence may be low, it has been recognised that a defendant may nevertheless pose an unacceptable risk pursuant to the statutory test: State of New South Wales v Richardson (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 276 at [94]; State of New South Wales v Thomas (Preliminary) [2011] NSWSC 118 at [16].
	
	
	The test in s 5B(2) is satisfied if there is a risk that the defendant will commit a serious sex offence which is present to a sufficient degree so that the safety and protection of the community cannot be ensured unless an order for the defendant’s continuing detention is made: State of New South Wales v Thomas (Preliminary) at [20]; State of New South Wales v Thomas (Final) [2011] NSWSC 307 at [56]-[58]; State of New South Wales v Conway [2011] NSWSC 588 at [30]; State of New South Wales v KAS [2012] NSWSC 1139 at [6].
	
	
	Whilst his eight weeks of liberty gives some indication that the risk posed by the defendant may not manifest, there is a solid body of evidence of much more deeply entrenched and long lasting anti-social behaviour that suggests the contrary conclusion.
	
	
	Having considered the evidence before the Court, and having had regard to the matters referred to in s 17(4) of the Act, I am satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order.
	
	
	Accordingly, I intend to make the orders sought by the State.
	


ORDERS


	
	I order that:
	



	
	Pursuant to s 17(1)(b) of the Act the defendant be the subject of a high risk sex offender continuing detention order for a period of 12 months from the date of the order.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 20(1) of the Act that a warrant issue forthwith for the committal of the defendant to a correctional centre for the period specified in Order (1) above.
	
	
	Pursuant to ss 5C and 9(1)(a) of the Act the defendant, for a period of 5 years from the date of the expiry of the continuing detention order, be subject to an extended supervision order and, pursuant to section 11 of the Act direct that, for the period of the extended supervision order, the defendant comply with the conditions set out below in the Schedule to these Orders.
	
	
	Any reports prepared for the purposes of Order 1 to be provided to any Corrective Services New South Wales officers involved in assessing, managing or supervising the defendant and any psychiatrist, psychologist and/or other health care practitioner involved in assessing, treating and/or counselling the defendant.

	The Applicant had entered pleas of guilty to the charges in the Local Court, and the Court allowed a rolled-up discount in the order of 30% for the Applicant’s early pleas and his past assistance to authorities.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	By Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal filed on 15 September 2015, the Applicant identified the following grounds of appeal:
	



	
	Ground 1 - the sentencing Judge failed to sufficiently take into account the effects of the Applicant’s physical disabilities.
	
	
	Ground 2 - the sentencing process miscarried as it proceeded on an erroneous basis, in that the extent of and the future physical effects caused by the disease [from which] the Applicant suffered was not fully appreciated at the time sentence was passed.
	
	
	Ground 3 - the sentencing Judge erred in failing to take into account in mitigation the depression the Applicant was suffering at the time of the commission of the offences.
	
	
	Ground 4 - the sentence imposed in all the circumstances was manifestly excessive.
	


Facts of Offences


	
	An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing and the following is drawn from that document.
	
	
	During April 2012, a police strike force was formed to investigate the supply of cocaine throughout the Sydney CBD and surrounding suburbs. In late May 2012, authority was granted to conduct a controlled operation in relation to purchasing cocaine.
	
	
	The Applicant was identified as a street-level supplier.
	
	
	On three separate occasions between 26 June 2012 and 11 July 2012, the Applicant (then 52 years old) sold 0.5 grams of cocaine to a police undercover operative (Count 1).
	
	
	During July and August 2012, the Applicant’s phone calls were recorded. On 16 separate days, the Applicant discussed his supply of 101 separate deals of cocaine. This amounted to 50.5 grams of cocaine for a total price of $25,250.00 (Count 3).
	
	
	The Applicant was arrested on 26 September 2012. He was found in possession of 13.97 grams of cocaine (Count 2 - deemed supply) and two resealable bags containing a further 1.16 grams of cocaine (Form 1 on Count 1).
	
	
	Given the issues raised in this Court concerning the Applicant’s health and submissions made on that topic, it is appropriate to set out in some detail, the range and duration of activities of the Applicant in the course of committing the offences.
	


Count 1 - Supplying Cocaine on an Ongoing Basis Between 26 June 2012 and 11 July 2012


	
	On 26 June 2012, a police undercover operative met with the Applicant at Pyrmont. The Applicant attended the meeting, driving a Toyota Corolla sedan. The operative spoke with the Applicant through the driver’s window and negotiated the purchase of cocaine for $300.00. The Applicant supplied the operative with a resealable plastic bag which contained 0.47 grams of cocaine with a purity of 37% (first supply).
	
	
	After the transaction, the Applicant drove away in the vehicle, travelling from Pyrmont to Redfern, and then to Surry Hills where he was pulled over in relation to a minor traffic infringement. The Applicant produced identification in his name.
	
	
	At about 5.00 pm on 3 July 2012, the Applicant and the undercover operative were monitored at Trouton Place, Pyrmont. The Applicant drove to this meeting in a different vehicle, a Toyota Camry sedan. The two persons negotiated the supply of cocaine for $250.00. The Applicant supplied the operative with a resealable plastic bag containing 0.51 grams of cocaine with a purity of 22% (second supply).
	
	
	At about 11.00 am on 11 July 2012, the operative sent a text message to the Applicant and, at about 5.00 pm that day, the operative met the Applicant again at Trouton Place, Pyrmont. The Applicant attended in the Toyota Camry vehicle. The operative entered the vehicle and negotiated the purchase of cocaine from the Applicant for $250.00. Once again, the Applicant supplied the operative with a resealable plastic bag containing 0.51 grams of cocaine with a purity of 33.5% (third supply).
	
	
	Following the Applicant’s arrest, on 26 September 2012, he participated in an electronically recorded interview in which he claimed to have no recollection of supplying cocaine to the undercover operative on the three occasions referred to above, but stated “You’ve obviously got the phone number, you’ve obviously got my voice, so I can’t, I can’t sit here and deny it”. Police then asked the Applicant whether supplying drugs three times in a 30-day period was something that he would normally do. He replied “Not really … Just maybe for a quick buck, maybe, that’s it”.
	


Count 3 - Supplying Cocaine Between 27 July 2012 and 22 September 2012 (Actual Supply)


	
	During investigations, police identified the Applicant supplying prohibited drugs on a regular basis to an extensive customer base, with the assistance of another male referred to as “S”.
	
	
	Between 27 July 2012 and 22 September 2012, the Applicant communicated with “S” and supplied him with cocaine on some 16 occasions. The units of supply involved single bags each weighing about 0.5 grams of cocaine.
	
	
	Consideration of extracts from recorded conversations, between the Applicant and “S”, assist an understanding of the frequency of the Applicant’s drug supply activities and the areas in which he carried on that business.
	
	
	On 27 July 2012, the Applicant, in conversation with “S”, referred to having sold “one in the city” (0.5 grams). At 6.45 pm that day, the Applicant called “S” and indicated that he had sold “another three” (1.5 grams). At 10.38 pm that night, the Applicant again called “S” and told him that he had “done three” that night (1.5 grams).
	
	
	At 5.17 pm on 3 August 2012, “S” and the Applicant spoke by telephone. With respect to the previous evening, the Applicant said that he had been “fucken busy” and that he “did 15” (7.5 grams of cocaine).
	
	
	On the evening of 4 August 2012, during another telephone conversation, the Applicant said that he had done “nine” that night (4.5 grams of cocaine).
	
	
	On the evening of 11 August 2012, the Applicant told “S” that things were “dead” and that “I’ve done one all day” (0.5 grams of cocaine).
	
	
	At 9.15 am on 13 August 2012, during a conversation with “S”, the Applicant said “You did five and I did two. We did seven the whole day”.
	
	
	On the evening of 15 August 2012, the Applicant called an unknown female to arrange a meeting. The Applicant said “I’ll come, I haven’t got many. What are you after?” and the female replied “Um, is three OK?”, with the Applicant stating “Yeah I’ve got enough, yeah”. About 30 minutes later, the Applicant sent a text message to the unknown female stating “Here”, indicating that he had arrived for the purpose of supplying three deals of cocaine to her (1.5 grams).
	
	
	On 19 August 2012, the Applicant called “S”. In response to an enquiry from “S” as to whether he had been busy, the Applicant replied “Nah I probably did Pyrmont then one in the Cross. Two.” (one gram of cocaine).
	
	
	On the evening of 25 August 2012, the Applicant called an unidentified female and arranged a meeting. They discussed quantity and price. After a number of telephone conversations, the Applicant rang the female to say he was there “in the car park”. The Applicant met with the woman for the purpose of supplying her with four deals of cocaine (two grams).
	
	
	On 4 September 2012, police intercepted a series of messages between the Applicant and an unidentified person. The person indicated that “two” were wanted and the Applicant replied “20 mins”. Thereafter, the Applicant sent a text message to the person indicating that he had arrived with the two deals (one gram).
	
	
	On the evening of 7 September 2012, “S” called the Applicant and they discussed how business had been that day. “S” said that he had “done six” and the Applicant replied “I’ve done two” (one gram of cocaine).
	
	
	On 14 September 2012, “S” called the Applicant and they discussed business. The Applicant said “I did South Coogee and Maroubra when I was there. And I sent you Woolloomooloo and Rose Bay”. “S” said “Yeah, I done those two”. Later that evening, the Applicant called “S” and the Applicant said “I just did one at Chippendale myself”.
	
	
	On the evening of 15 September 2012, an unidentified female rang the Applicant and they discussed a meeting. The woman said “I’m nearly at The Oaks. I just have to find out numbers … I’m nearly there, it’s going to be at least three” with the Applicant replying “Yeah, no worries. Don’t talk on the phone”. Soon after, the Applicant met with the woman and supplied three deals of cocaine (1.5 grams).
	
	
	Soon after on the evening of 15 September 2012, the Applicant called “S” and they discussed a job. The Applicant said “I just did one in Crown Street” which involved “five” (2.5 grams).
	
	
	Later that evening, the Applicant called an unidentified male to arrange a meeting. The male said he wanted “two”. Some time later, the Applicant rang the male and met him soon after to supply two deals of cocaine (one gram).
	
	
	That evening, the Applicant received a text message from an unidentified female who was in Manly. She said “Would like three wines if pos? Let me know”. Soon after the Applicant rang the female and confirmed a location to meet with the Applicant, supplying three deals of cocaine (1.5 grams) at the meeting.
	
	
	On 20 September 2012, “S” called the Applicant and they discussed the previous night’s work. The Applicant said “Last night, two to 11 for 40 bucks. I mean who does it? Who would do it?”. In the following discussion, the Applicant said that he had supplied “the two usuals” at “Harlequin and Holt Street”.
	
	
	On the evening of 21 September 2012, the Applicant called “S” and told him “I did 16 last night” (eight grams of cocaine).
	
	
	Later on 21 September 2012, the Applicant called “S” and the Applicant said “I’ve done one in North Sydney now. Miller Street, I’m going to do it … I’ve done three over this side so far. No actually I’ve done four today. St Leonards, Chatswood, Northbridge and now this one”. The Applicant had supplied four deals of cocaine (two grams) in this way.
	
	
	On the morning of 22 September 2012, the Applicant called “S” and they discussed their work that night. The Applicant said “I have 14 to give you” and the Applicant said soon after “Don’t go into the city without me because I have to give you some work”.
	
	
	Later that afternoon, “S” called the Applicant and they arranged to meet. The Applicant said “Meet me at North Parra McDonalds”. The meeting was for the purpose of supplying 14 deals of cocaine (seven grams).
	


Count 2 - Supplying Cocaine on 26 September 2012 (Deemed Supply)


	
	At about 12.55 pm on 26 September 2012, the Applicant parked another motor vehicle (not the Toyota Corolla or Toyota Camry referred to earlier) outside premises at St Leonards, and began walking into his house. He was approached by police and was placed under arrest and cautioned.
	
	
	Police conducted a search of the Applicant and his vehicle. A large clear plastic bag containing a white round ball substance, wrapped in tissue paper, was located inside the Applicant’s jacket. Upon analysis, it was found to contain 13.97 grams of cocaine at 47% purity.
	
	
	During the search, the Applicant took two mobile phones from his jacket and handed them to the police. Later that afternoon, police returned to the Applicant’s premises to execute a search warrant. The police seized four mobile phones and two small resealable plastic bags containing white powder, which were located in a kitchen drawer.
	
	
	During an electronically recorded interview, the Applicant admitted that the drugs in question were located in his pocket and that it was cocaine. He said he had paid $2,500.00 for the drugs and that he “was gunna use it. Just keep it for myself”.
	


Form 1 Offence Taken Into Account on Count 1 - Possession of Cocaine on 26 September 2012


	
	During the search of the Applicant, police seized two clear resealable plastic bags containing white powder that were located inside his wallet. Upon analysis, the substance was confirmed as being 1.16 grams of cocaine. During the electronically recorded interview, the Applicant admitted that the drugs were his and said they were “Just for me. Just party, go out”.
	


The Applicant’s Subjective Circumstances


	
	The Applicant was 52 years old at the time of the offences and 54 years old at the time of sentence.
	
	
	The Applicant had a prior criminal history. On 17 January 1985, he was fined $200.00 at the Lidcombe Local Court for goods in custody. On 28 January 2000, he was placed on a two-year recognisance at the Downing Centre Local Court for making a false statement to obtain money.
	
	
	On 3 July 2009, he was sentenced at the Sydney District Court for offences of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (in 2003-2004), money laundering in the amount of $494,350.00 (in 2004) and money laundering in the amount of $325,015.54 (in 2004). He was sentenced to suspended terms of imprisonment for a total period of two years for these offences.
	
	
	Before the sentencing court were:
	



	
	a presentence report dated 26 September 2013;
	
	
	reports dated 6 May 2013 and 9 September 2013 from Dr Alastair Corbett, neurologist, concerning his treatment of the Applicant, since 1994, for autosomal recessive Becker-Type myotonia congenita, a condition which results in a combination of muscle stiffness and muscle weakness;
	
	
	a report dated 14 March 2014 from Anita Duffy, psychologist;
	
	
	various statements of service, references and other documents concerning the Applicant.
	



	
	The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	Given the issues raised on appeal, reference should be made to Dr Corbett’s material. In his report of 9 September 2013, Dr Corbett said:
	


“Mr Hanna becomes weak after resting with his strength and stiffness improving to a varying extent with activity. This has resulted in him being unsteady on his feet and suffering frequent falls. Mr Hanna has experienced weakness of most muscle groups including his face arms and legs. This makes it difficult for him to walk reliably and difficult to use public transport. His physical incapacity has resulted in frustration and depression. He has always struggled to work and had difficulty with public transport or walking in crowded areas. He has sought psychological assistance on a number of occasions as early as 1999 for assistance with gambling and depression. These problems arise from his chronic medical condition.”


	
	Dr Corbett concluded this report:
	


“He is currently mildly to moderately depressed and is treated with Pristiq 50mg daily to help control this. It is my opinion that he would struggle to manage a custodial sentence due to his muscle weakness, which is very variable, and his muscle stiffness which both result in unsteadiness of gait, frequent falls and discomfort.”


	
	In the report of 6 May 2013, Dr Corbett said that the Applicant’s muscle weakness and stiffness had “become progressively more severe over the last 10 years”.
	


Some Findings of the Sentencing Judge


	
	After recounting the facts of the offences, the sentencing Judge observed that it was clear that the Applicant “was substantially involved in the distribution of cocaine, and that he operated in conjunction with another offender ‘S’, directing him to work at least on one occasion, and also supplying ‘S’ with deals for ‘S’ to supply” (ROS11). His Honour found further that the Applicant was “in effect a supplier of ‘half weights’, being 0.5 gram deals of cocaine, on a regular basis from 26 June 2012 through to at least 22 September 2012, and on 26 September 2012 was then located with a bulk supply of 13.97 grams before it might be distributed” (ROS11-12).
	
	
	The sentencing Judge found that the Applicant had been operating “‘on call’ over a substantial area of the Sydney metropolitan area and by providing, in effect, a delivery service” (ROS12). The Court found that “each of the relevant offences in the context of his overall conduct must be regarded as a serious offence” (ROS12).
	
	
	His Honour recounted the material before the Court concerning the Applicant’s subjective circumstances, including medical and psychological reports, references and other documents and the Applicant’s criminal history (ROS12ff).
	
	
	Given the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to set out that part of the remarks on sentence which addressed the Applicant’s medical condition (ROS16-17):
	


“His physical disability arises as a result of his suffering from Becker's Myotonia Congenita, which is a rare inherited muscle disorder which results in generalised muscle weakness and stiffness, particularly when he rises in the morning, but improves with activity during the day. He was first diagnosed with that condition in 1994. The weakness and stiffness of his muscles has progressively become more severe over the last 10 years. He is said to have marked leg weakness and unsteadiness, and will fall with no warning. Uneven surfaces may cause him to fall, and hence he is prone to injury. Even simple bumps may destabilise him sufficiently to cause him to fall. The muscle stiffness also involves his face, the muscles of speech and swallowing, as well as his arms and legs, and results in an intermittent inability to speak intelligibly or swallow.

He is treated with Pristiq, 50 milligrams daily. I note that his treating neurologist, a Dr Alastair Corbett, being a senior specialist with the neurology department at Concord Repatriation Hospital, expresses his concern in respect of how the offender might cope with a period of imprisonment. Otherwise, it is noted in the reports from Dr Corbett as well as the report from Anita Duffy, psychologist, that the offender as a result of his physical disability now of a long standing nature, has suffered from depression for a considerable period of time. Anita Duffy indicates that at the time she tested him, he had severe depression.  In respect of his ability to move around, she stated, ‘his self consciousness, however, of being perceived as not normal, has resulted in his refusal to use a walking stick, which could aid his balance and stability’. I note today that he has appeared in court making use of a walking stick.”


	
	After considering material bearing upon the Applicant’s use of prohibited substances, his Honour returned to the question of the Applicant’s medical condition and disability (ROS18):
	


“I accept that the offender is subject to a significant disability as a result of the particular health problem that he suffers from. However, he clearly has no problem in relation to driving motor vehicles in relation to what is said to be his current employment [delivering prestige vehicles], and also as can be seen from his conduct in driving around a significant portion of the Sydney metropolitan area at night to conduct his trade.”


	
	His Honour moved to issues of remorse and assistance to authorities (ROS18-19):
	


“The offender has not given evidence on sentence, which may have assisted the Court in relation to the assessment of any possible remorse or contrition. The facts indicate that when arrested by the police, he was not completely frank with them and he appears to have endeavoured to deceive them to the extent that he thought he might have been able to.

The Court has been provided with Exhibit 2, being a confidential letter relating to assistance. Because of the nature of that letter, I will not refer in detail to its contents, however, in my view the contents indicate that while he has purported to assist the authorities, he has provided little more, if any, than what they were already aware of in respect of his offending, or of any other matter that might be regarded as of interest. What has been provided by him is in effect referred to as being ‘intelligence’. That is no doubt of some assistance to the authorities.

Of serious concern however is that there are a number of matters referred to in the report that indicate that to a considerable extent, the offender endeavoured to use the assistance as a way to attempt to convince the police that he had a significantly lesser role than that which he actually did.

Significantly, despite the offender's considerable contacts within the industry of distributing prohibited drugs, it is of note that the offender has provided no information that has led to the arrest of any other person. Nonetheless, even ‘intelligence’ is of some assistance and I propose to allow a total combined discount for the plea of guilty and assistance in the order of 30%.”


	
	The sentencing Judge referred to concerns about the Applicant managing in custody (ROS19-20):
	


“Although there are remarks in his treating neurologist's report and the psychologist's report as to his fears, should he be sentenced to a full term of imprisonment, and accepting that it would appear likely that his condition will continue to deteriorate with age, there is no specific information before me, from any person who would have appropriate knowledge that the term of imprisonment would be significantly harder for him than any other individual, or that Corrective Services would not be able to cope with his particular problems.

I accept that his physical condition has no doubt had a significant effect in relation to depression, which he has suffered from for a lengthy period of time, and I accept that that has a relationship to his ever having embarked on the use, late in life, of cocaine. I do not however accept that it provides any excuse, or mitigates the offences with which he has been charged.

His conduct involves significant breaches of the law over a significant period in respect of offences that are difficult to detect, easy to commit and that there is a significant call to take account of both specific and general deterrence.”


	
	His Honour made findings concerning the Applicant’s use of prohibited drugs and the impact of that factor on sentence (ROS20-21):
	


“I am prepared to accept that the offender was a user and that part of his offending conduct was to enable himself to indulge his own use of prohibited drugs, but of note is that he was dealing in cocaine even though in individual small quantities on a consistent, regular basis, that the intercepted calls relevant to the offence of supply of a prohibited drug (50.5 grams) relate to an assessed total sale of $25,250 within a period of approximately two months. That is a substantial sum of money. I do not accept that his dealing was limited to being only to support his own use.

I will accept, since the offender has no previous history of offending in relation to prohibited drugs, and considering his expressions of remorse, as previously indicated, that he is indeed remorseful and contrite in respect of these offences.

I cannot find that there is a good prospect of rehabilitation, particularly considering the period of his offending, and the nature of it, and the fact that the only source of information as to the offender having ceased using cocaine is self-reporting. In that respect, there must be a question mark over the veracity of the offender, considering the content of the letter of assistance, that is, that he at least appears to have a tendency to attempt to help his position by false representations. 

Given his age and his lack of previous history in relation to prohibited drugs I find that there is a reasonable prospect of rehabilitation and certainly a low prospect of re-offending.”


	
	His Honour found special circumstances, which included the Applicant’s medical condition (ROS23):
	


“You are sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of five years. I find special circumstances, particularly since this is really your first period of imprisonment, and noting that I accept that your medical condition may mean that any term of imprisonment will weigh more heavily on you than on a prisoner who does not suffer from your medical condition. I will find special circumstances and adjust the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term in your favour.”

Ground 1 - Claim that the Sentencing Judge Failed to Sufficiently Take Into Account the Effects of the Applicant’s Physical Disabilities

Ground 3 - Claim that the Sentencing Judge Erred in Failing to Take Into Account in Mitigation the Depression Suffered by the Applicant at the Time of Commission of the Offences


	
	It is convenient to consider these grounds of appeal together.
	


The Applicant’s Submissions


	
	In support of Ground 1, Mr Ramage QC, for the Applicant, drew attention to the evidence before the sentencing Judge concerning the Applicant’s muscular condition, first diagnosed in the Applicant in 1979. He sought to contrast the finding of the sentencing Judge with respect to special circumstances, where his Honour accepted that imprisonment would weigh more heavily on the Applicant because of his medical condition (see [63] above) with his Honour’s observation that there was no specific information before him that the term of imprisonment would be significantly harder for the Applicant, or that custodial authorities would not be able to cope with his particular problems (see [61] above).
	
	
	It was submitted, as well, that there was no mention made by the sentencing Judge of the Applicant’s fears of prison and the risk of attack arising from his physical disabilities.
	
	
	With respect to Ground 3, it was noted that the sentencing Judge had referred to Ms Duffy’s reference to depression, but it was submitted that his Honour had failed to take into account applicable principles where an offender with a mental disorder is to be sentenced for an offence.
	
	
	It was submitted that the sentencing Judge was in error in:
	



	
	failing to make any allowance, by way of mitigation of penalty, for the Applicant’s depression at the time of the commission of the offences; and
	
	
	failing to make any allowance, in mitigation, to the weight to be given to either general or specific deterrence or both.
	


The Crown Submissions


	
	With respect to Ground 1, the Crown submitted that the extent to which the Applicant’s physical disability would cause him hardship in custody was raised and properly considered by the sentencing Judge on the material before him.
	
	
	The Crown noted that his Honour had regard to the reports of Dr Corbett and Ms Duffy. Having done so, it was submitted that his Honour had regard to this subjective feature in finding special circumstances, no doubt to avoid double counting of these features.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was clearly open to his Honour to take the Applicant’s ongoing physical problems into account in the way that he did, and that the Applicant had not demonstrated error in this respect.
	
	
	With respect to Ground 3, the Crown submitted that his Honour accepted that the Applicant was suffering from depression. The sentencing Judge had found that there was a relationship between his depression and his use of cocaine.
	
	
	The Crown submitted, however, that the Applicant was being sentenced for his substantial involvement in distribution of cocaine by way of an “on call” supply activity providing a delivery service over a large geographical area, with his offending motivated, in part at least, for financial gain.
	
	
	Given the nature of the offending, the Crown submitted that it was well open to the sentencing Judge to find that the Applicant’s depression did not reduce his moral culpability and that matters such as general and specific deterrence, retribution and denunciation still required attention.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that no error, as claimed in Ground 3, had been demonstrated.
	


Decision


	
	Ground 1 asserts error in failing to sufficiently take a matter into account on sentence. This Court said in Bland v R [2014] NSWCCA 82; 241 A Crim R 51 at 66 [112]-[113]:
	


“112   The failure of a sentencing Judge to attribute sufficient weight to an issue at sentence will not generally be a material error. Questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first-instance Judge, and the circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11]; Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49 at [25].

113   A ground of appeal asserting that a Judge attributed insufficient weight to an issue has the inherent problem of implicitly acknowledging that some weight has been placed on the issue: DF v R [2012] NSWCCA 171 at [77].”


	
	The sentencing Judge had regard to the letters from Dr Corbett, his treating neurologist, as well as the report of Ms Duffy, a consultant psychologist.
	
	
	In relation to the Applicant’s physical disability, the sentencing Judge took into account:
	



	
	the nature of the condition and its symptoms as described by Dr Corbett (ROS16-17);
	
	
	the fact that the Applicant is subject to a significant disability as a result of this condition (ROS18);
	
	
	the fact that Dr Corbett expressed concerns in respect of how the Applicant might cope with a period of punishment (ROS17);
	
	
	the fact that, as a result of the condition, the Applicant suffered depression which Ms Duffy has assessed as severe (ROS17);
	
	
	the fact that the Applicant’s significant disability did not appear to have impeded his driving or his drug supply activities (ROS18);
	
	
	Dr Corbett’s opinion that his condition would continue to deteriorate with age (ROS20);
	
	
	the fact that the Applicant has expressed fears should he be imprisoned - however, there was no specific information before the Court from any person, with appropriate knowledge, that the term of imprisonment would be significantly harder for him or that Corrective Services would not be able to cope with his problems (ROS19-20).
	



	
	Given the nature of the Applicant’s condition, and the material before the sentencing court, it was open to his Honour to take the Applicant’s ongoing physical problems into account in the way in which he did. I do not detect any inconsistency between his Honour’s conclusions as complained of by the Applicant at [65] above.
	
	
	His Honour found that the Applicant had a “significant disability”, but that did not require the Court to find, as well, that a term of imprisonment would be “significantly harder” on the Applicant than another individual (see [61] above).
	
	
	It was open to the sentencing Judge to approach the Applicant’s physical disabilities, by way of a finding of special circumstances, with the imposition of a non-parole period which constituted 60% of the total term. The finding in this respect was that imprisonment would “weigh more heavily” on the Applicant because of his condition (see [63] above). In adopting this approach, his Honour was conscious to avoid inappropriate double counting of subjective factors in passing sentence: R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240 at [102]-[107].
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the Applicant has demonstrated error as alleged in Ground 1.
	
	
	In approaching Ground 3, reference should be made to the principles summarised by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at 43 [177]:
	


“Where an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing: see, eg, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; R v Tsiarias [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40] – [48]; Lauritsen v R [2000] WASCA 203; (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [43] – [51]; R v Harb [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35] – [45]; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255; R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] – [36]; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102 at [32]; Courtney v R [2007] NSWCCA 195 at [14]-[18]; and R v Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28]. They can be summarised in the following manner: 

●    Where the state of a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [254]; Miller v R [1999] WASCA 66 at [23]; R v Jiminez [1999] WASCA 7 at [23], [25]; Tsiaras at 400; Lauritsen at [51]; Israil at [23]; R v Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]; Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28]. 

●    It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed: Engert at 71; R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50 – 51; Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]; Henry at [28]. 

●    It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced: Tsiaris at 400; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26]; Henry at [28]. 

●    It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence: Courtney at [14]; Tsiaras at 400; Israil at [25]; JW at [192]. 

●    Conversely, it may be that because of a person’s mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence: Israil at [24]; Henry at [28]. Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public: R v Lawrence [2005] NSWCCA 91 per Spigelman CJ at [23] - [24].”


	
	There was evidence before the sentencing Judge that the Applicant suffered from depression, and had done so for some time. His Honour accepted that there was a link between the Applicant’s depression and his use of cocaine.
	
	
	However, his Honour did not find any nexus between the Applicant’s depression and his drug supply offences. These offences revealed a man in his early 50s engaged in persistent and protracted drug supply and operating a delivery business, in various parts of the Sydney metropolitan area, at different times throughout the day and night. There was no impediment to the Applicant driving motor vehicles for the purpose of this business, and communicating with customers (and his co-offender, “S”) on a regular basis.
	
	
	It is understandable, in these circumstances, that his Honour did not find that the Applicant’s moral culpability ought be reduced because of his depression.
	
	
	Once again, given the nature of the Applicant’s serious and persistent offending conduct, no proper basis was demonstrated in this case for reducing the weight to be given to general deterrence and specific deterrence because of his depression.
	
	
	The Applicant has not demonstrated error on the part of the sentencing Judge in the manner complained of in Ground 3. I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 2 - Claim that the Sentencing Process Miscarried as a Result of an Incorrect Understanding of the Future Physical Effects of the Applicant’s Disability Arising from Fresh or New Evidence


	
	I approach this ground of appeal upon the basis that the Applicant has failed to demonstrate error on the part of the sentencing Judge, in the ways contended for in Grounds 1 and 3. The findings made by the sentencing Judge, in the areas caught by those grounds, were open to his Honour.
	
	
	It is appropriate then to move to Ground 2, which contends that fresh or new evidence (which is available since sentence was passed) indicates that the sentencing Judge imposed sentence on an incomplete understanding of the Applicant’s deteriorating physical condition.
	


Material Tendered by the Applicant and Objected to by the Crown


	
	The Applicant tenders the following material in this Court:
	



	
	an affidavit of Ronny Malouf filed 15 September 2015 - this affidavit annexes various Justice Health and Corrective Services records concerning the Applicant’s imprisonment, which records some falls by the Applicant and a recommendation in May 2015 that he be housed in a “one-out cell” due to his susceptibility to falls, and further medical reports including a report dated 29 July 2015 of Dr Corbett (to which further reference will be made below);
	
	
	a further affidavit of Ronny Malouf filed 27 November 2015 which states that the Applicant is housed at the Kirkconnell Correctional Centre, where he has experienced another fall and where there is limited medical assistance available;
	
	
	an affidavit of the Applicant filed 15 September 2015 in which he recounts falls he had experienced and his fears concerning further falls;
	
	
	an affidavit of Christopher Patino filed 15 September 2015 concerning falls by the Applicant which Mr Patino (a prisoner) had witnessed;
	
	
	an affidavit of Fabian Michael filed 15 September 2015 concerning falls by the Applicant which Mr Michael (a prisoner) had witnessed;
	
	
	an affidavit of Annette Zeaiter filed 15 September 2015 - Ms Zeaiter is the former wife of the Applicant (they separated in 2000) and she states that she is prepared to take care of the Applicant upon his release from custody.
	



	
	In the event that the Court admitted the evidence referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Crown sought to read an affidavit of Jennifer Ramsey filed 25 November 2015, which annexed material concerning the capacity of Justice Health to manage the Applicant’s disability in custody. Other annexed material stated that the Applicant had not applied to be transferred to a metropolitan facility from Kirkconnell Correctional Centre, as he had sought a further reduction in security rating for the purpose of participating in the day/weekend leave program.
	
	
	The principal material relied upon by the Applicant as fresh or new evidence, which was not available at the time of the sentencing hearing, is the report of Dr Corbett of 29 July 2015. Dr Corbett stated that the Applicant’s disease has “progressed more rapidly than I would have anticipated between my review on 23.5.2013 and Mr Hanna’s most recent review 25.6.2015” and that “during that time his leg weakness has progressed rapidly resulting in increasing vulnerability to falling and injuries”. Dr Corbett stated that it is “probable that his disease will continue to progress at a similar rate making him increasingly vulnerable to injury and requiring increasing assistance”. He considered that the Applicant “cannot be adequately accommodated and cared for by a Correctional Services and that a period in prison will have a long term adverse effect on his state of health and physical function”.
	


Submissions of Parties


	
	Mr Ramage QC submitted that this evidence, and in particular the most recent report of Dr Corbett, should be received by this Court as fresh or new evidence. He submitted that the material could also be received by the Court if error was established, and the Court was moving to resentence for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. This possible use of the material does not arise at this point, as no error has been established in accordance with Grounds 1 and 3.
	
	
	Mr Ramage QC submitted that the material before this Court demonstrates that the Applicant’s medical condition, and its ongoing increasing progression, was not fully known or fully appreciated at the time sentence was passed. Reliance was placed upon the decision of this Court in Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118; 209 A Crim R 509 at 528-531 [104]-[121].
	
	
	The Crown objected to this evidence, submitting that it does not fall within the principles identified in Khoury v R. The Crown submitted that all of the unfortunate medical conditions and physical limitations that have affected the Applicant were in contemplation at the time of the sentencing hearing: Turkmani v R [2014] NSWCCA 186 at [89].
	
	
	Even if the Court determined to admit the material, the Crown submitted that the Court would not be satisfied that it renders the Applicant’s period of incarceration more onerous than was appreciated when he was sentenced, so as to justify any reduction of his non-parole period: Inglesias v R [2006] NSWCCA 261 at [13];Turkmani v R at [91].
	


Decision


	
	It is recognised in Khoury v R at 528 [105] that the general rule that a person is bound by the way that his or her case was presented at first instance is not absolute, particularly in criminal cases, having regard to the need to accommodate the interests of justice. However, there are limits to the extent to which the Court may legitimately accept additional evidence: Khoury v R at 528 [105]; Grant v R [2014] NSWCCA 67 at [55].
	
	
	This Court has emphasised that caution must be exercised in the admission of evidence of this type. Regard should be had, amongst other things, to the potential significance of the evidence to have affected the outcome at first instance: Khoury v R at 531 [121]; Bland v R at 63 [83].
	
	
	In Bland v R, this Court observed at 63 [86]:
	


“In R v Fordham, Howie AJ (Hunt CJ at CL and Smart AJ agreeing) stated at 377-378 that, even if the evidence is fresh, it ought not be received by the Court unless it affects the outcome of the case. Generally, it must be shown that the sentencing of the offender, in the absence of the fresh evidence, resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The miscarriage of justice principle in R v Fordham was applied in Norrie v R [2008] NSWCCA 185 at [22].”


	
	It was not suggested that this was an exceptional case to which the general rule did not apply. Accordingly, to make good Ground 2, it is necessary for the Applicant to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice on sentence arose from the absence of the additional evidence.
	
	
	There was substantial evidence before the sentencing Judge concerning the Applicant’s condition, including the expectation that his condition would deteriorate and he would experience falls in custody. The sentencing Judge took these aspects into account on sentence (see [58]-[59], [61], [63] above).
	
	
	I have had regard to the totality of the proffered additional evidence. The high point of this evidence is Dr Corbett’s opinion that the progression of the disease in the Applicant has accelerated. It was expected, at the time of the sentencing hearing, that there would be deterioration.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the tendered additional evidence should be admitted by this Court. It seems to me that there is no substantial difference between Dr Corbett’s earlier opinion and his latest opinion. The evidence concerning what has happened in custody does not suggest any marked additional deterioration to that which was anticipated at the time of sentence.
	
	
	Nor does the evidence suggest that Justice Health and the Commissioner of Corrective Services is not able to manage the Applicant’s condition in custody, in particular if the Applicant seeks to be housed in facilities considered appropriate by correctional authorities.
	
	
	Even if the threshold for the admission of this material had been met, I would not be satisfied in this case that the material renders the Applicant’s period of incarceration more onerous than was appreciated when he was sentenced so as to justify any reduction of his non-parole period: Inglesias v R at [13]; Turkmani v R at [91].
	
	
	It is necessary to keep in mind the objective seriousness of the Applicant’s offending conduct. The Applicant committed these serious drug supply offences knowing of his medical condition and with a likely expectation that, if convicted, he would be sentenced to a term of imprisonment.
	
	
	Where an offender with health problems engages in serious and protracted criminality, knowing that the consequence of detection is imprisonment, then this consideration is also relevant to the weight to be given to the offender’s medical condition on sentence: R v Achurch [2011] NSWCCA 186; 216 A Crim R 152 at 172 [136]. This statement in R v Achurch is not affected by the later decisions in Achurch v R (No. 2) [2013] NSWCCA 117; 84 NSWLR 328 and Achurch v The Queen [2014] HCA 10; 253 CLR 141.
	
	
	The Applicant has not demonstrated that a miscarriage of justice on sentence arose from the absence of the additional evidence. I would reject Ground 2.
	


Ground 4 - Claim that the Sentence was Manifestly Excessive


	
	The remaining ground of appeal contends that the sentence imposed upon the Applicant was manifestly excessive. Having regard to the conclusions reached with respect to the other grounds, this ground may be dealt with shortly.
	


The Applicant’s Submissions


	
	It was submitted for the Applicant that the total sentence imposed was unduly harsh and severe, and was manifestly excessive when full and proper consideration was given to a number of factors:
	



	
	the Applicant was aged 54 years and it was his first time in custody;
	
	
	his medical condition at the time of the commission of the offences and thereafter;
	
	
	his depression at the time of the commission of the offences and thereafter;
	
	
	his plea of guilty was an early one and, with assistance, a combined discount of 30% was allowed;
	
	
	the Applicant was a user, and part of his offending conduct was to enable himself to indulge his own use of prohibited drugs;
	
	
	there was a finding that the Applicant was remorseful and contrite in respect of the offences;
	
	
	his Honour found there was a reasonable prospect of rehabilitation and a low prospect of reoffending;
	
	
	the Applicant had a very limited criminal record, with no prior offences involving drugs.
	


The Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that the Applicant had committed serious drug supply offences. It was submitted that this was a serious example of supplying cocaine on an ongoing basis.
	
	
	Taking into account the objective seriousness, and all relevant aspects of the Applicant’s subjective case, together with the statutory guideposts on sentence (maximum penalties of 20 years and 15 years), it was submitted that an aggregate sentence of five years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years could not be regarded as manifestly excessive.
	


Decision


	
	To make good this ground of appeal, it is necessary for the Applicant to establish that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 371 [25]. It is not simply a matter for this Court to substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge, because it might have exercised discretion in a different manner: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 339 [57].
	
	
	The Applicant committed drug supply offences of considerable objective gravity. He was involved heavily in the distribution of cocaine.
	
	
	He operated a cocaine distribution business in conjunction with another offender, whom he directed to work and also supplied with deals for further supply. The Applicant was a street-level supplier on a regular basis for a period of three months and, upon arrest, was found with a bulk supply of 13.97 grams of cocaine before it was distributed. He conducted an “on call” delivery service over a substantial part of the Sydney metropolitan area. Although the Applicant was a drug user, and part of the offending was to enable him to continue that use, there was a substantial financial gain made by the Applicant.
	
	
	With respect to the s.25A offence (Count 1), it is appropriate to bear in mind the observations of Wood CJ at CL (Dowd J agreeing) in R v CBK [2002] NSWCCA 457; 135 A Crim R 260 at 269 [56]-[57]:
	


“56    … Section 25A of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 was introduced in order to provide a strong deterrent to those who may be tempted to engage in an ongoing trade in drugs. It needs to be clearly understood that s 25A offences are considerably more serious than s 25 offences, as is indicated by the increase in the maximum available penalty. 

57    An offender charged with a s 25A offence cannot rely upon an argument that the act of supply was an isolated event. Nor can [he] expect to receive a sentence of the kind which may be appropriate for a single offence of supply. Significant sentences must be imposed in such cases in order [to] give effect to the clear legislative intention to discourage the ongoing trade in drugs, which depends entirely upon the availability of a person such as the present applicant.”


	
	As it happens, the Applicant was to be sentenced, as well, for a most serious s.25(1) offence, involving multiple supplies of cocaine over a two-month period (Count 3). At the time of his arrest, he possessed a bulk quantity of cocaine for further supply (Count 2).
	
	
	The sentencing Judge had proper regard to the Applicant’s subjective circumstances. Although the Applicant had no prior convictions for drug supply, his criminal record included serious offences, in particular those for which he was sentenced in 2009.
	
	
	The Applicant was a man of mature years who chose to become involved in serious and protracted drug supply. Despite his health difficulties, he managed to operate quite effectively in that venture, driving to a variety of places to service his customers.
	
	
	The Applicant’s medical condition was a relevant factor on sentence. However, it was important that this persuasive subjective consideration not overshadow the objective gravity of the Applicant’s offences: R v Achurch at 171 [128].
	
	
	Having regard to the objective gravity of the offences, and the Applicant’s subjective circumstances, the aggregate sentence imposed at first instance lay within the range of sentences reasonably available in the circumstances. I am not persuaded that the aggregate sentence imposed upon the Applicant was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	I would reject Ground 4.
	


Conclusion


	
	The Applicant has failed to make good any of his grounds of appeal.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Reject the tender of the additional evidence relied upon by the Applicant in support of Ground 2;
	
	
	leave to appeal granted;
	
	
	appeal dismissed.
	



	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Johnson J.

	The trial of Trent Towney on a charge of murder commenced before me in Orange on 7 September 2015. The accused is alleged to have stabbed John Frail, fatally, on 20 July 2013. After the jury had retired to consider their verdict certain misconduct of one of their number was brought to my attention. I discharged the jury before they had reached a verdict, on 18 September 2015.
	
	
	The retrial of Trent Towney is to commence on 1 February 2016, again at Orange, and I have been allocated to preside. The date was fixed at a callover before Johnson J on 2 October 2015. On 14 December 2015 the solicitor for the accused notified my chambers that an application would be made that I disqualify myself. He was requested by my associate to provide urgently the materials upon which this application would be made.
	
	
	I listed the application for hearing on the earliest date available to myself and defence counsel, being Friday 18 December 2015. Crown counsel assigned to the retrial and who had prosecuted at the first trial was unavailable for that date but the application had to proceed. 18 December 2015 is the last court sitting day before the date fixed for the retrial in Orange, taking into account the Court’s fixed long vacation through late December 2015 and January 2016. These are my reasons for dismissing the application.
	


The limited requests for re-direction at trial


	
	The application to disqualify is brought upon the ground of apprehended bias said to be exhibited in passages of the summing-up which I delivered to the jury on 16 and 17 September 2015. I therefore commence these reasons by identifying the limited extent to which complaint about the summing up was made by defence counsel at the trial and the limited scope of the re-directions which were sought.
	
	
	Towards the end of the summing-up at pp 66 to 72 some redirections were asked for with respect to what I had said to the jury up to that time. First, a redirection was requested with respect to the subject of what use the jury might make of lies alleged to have been told by the accused. I gave a redirection on that at p 73.
	
	
	Secondly, I was asked to redirect upon the evidence of distances which had been estimated by Crown witnesses, variously, between a vehicle which was stationary in Federation Street at the time of the stabbing and a nearby road barrier. I gave a redirection about that at p 75.
	
	
	Thirdly at the top of p 71 a redirection was requested with respect to whether there was any evidence that the deceased had been ""down"", as defence counsel put it, at the time when he was stabbed. When counsel was addressing me on that point his submission was cut off but reconstructing as best I can the transcript quoted in the first third of p 71 of the summing-up, I interpret that defence counsel was seeking a redirection on the question of whether there was any evidence to show that the deceased may have been bent over and moving towards the accused at the time when he sustained the fatal stab wound which I will describe shortly.
	
	
	I declined to re-direct on this, dismissing the complaint with the words which appear about a third of the way down p 71 of the summing up, “you addressed them on that”. This subject of whether the deceased had been bent over when he received the fatal knife wound was relevant to what inference the jury would draw regarding the accused’s intention in wielding the knife. The present assertion of apprehended bias is in part founded upon my summing up on intention, in particular so far as I summed up the evidence regarding the posture of the deceased at the time he received the fatal wound and how that fact would bear upon the accused’s intention: see [27] – [59].
	
	
	Fourthly, at p 71 a redirection was sought regarding evidence of the manner in which the accused had held the knife – whether his grip was thumb and forefinger towards the end of the knife handle furthest from the blade or whether it was the reverse, thumb and forefinger at the blade end of the handle.
	
	
	On this subject, after discussion with me about the time at which Brody Roach had observed a particular grip, defence counsel did not press for the re-direction.
	
	
	Fifthly, a redirection was sought on the question of what evidence was available to the jury concerning the degree to which the accused may have been intoxicated at the time of the fatal attack on the deceased.
	
	
	On the fifth subject, intoxication, I declined to give any redirection. The contention made on the present application that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias on my part is in part based upon the way in which I summed up on the subject of intoxication: see [70] – [85].
	
	
	After these requests for redirection had been ruled upon, when the summing-up resumed at page 73 I did, as earlier mentioned, redirect on the two matters which I considered warranted it. My summing-up concluded at page 83 and at that point no further redirection was sought by either counsel.
	


Delay in bringing the application for recusal


	
	When this matter was before Johnson J on 2 October 2015 for callover to appoint a date for retrial, the Crown and defence were informed that the retrial was allocated to me. No objection was then taken to my presiding at the retrial, nor was any reservation expressed. From 2 October to 14 November 2015 no communication was made from the accused's representatives to the Court foreshadowing an application of the nature now brought or suggesting that instructions would be taken regarding any difficulty that might be thought to arise if I should conduct the second trial.
	
	
	I have now been informed by Mr Nash who appeared for the accused at the trial and who appears for him on this notice of motion that the reason for the application being deferred until what is in practical terms the last possible moment before commencement of the retrial is that it was not determined by those instructing him that he would be counsel for the retrial until late November. I do not consider that a justification for the delay. Whatever uncertainty there may have been regarding trial representation, Mr Nash's instructing solicitors should have ascertained from him at the latest by the date of the callover whether he saw any objection to my being the judge at the second trial.
	
	
	It is common practice in this Court for a judge who has conducted a trial which has aborted also to conduct the retrial (see [90], below). It should have been anticipated that that practice would be followed and counsel who had appeared at the first trial should have been asked to advise his instructing solicitors whether or not that would present any difficulty – so that it could be foreshadowed to the list judge on callover. Whether or not he was briefed for the retrial it would have been Mr Nash's duty to volunteer to the solicitors who instructed him in the first trial that he thought continuity of the trial judge would be objectionable, if that were the case. It is regrettable that this application, which could have been and should have been foreshadowed at the callover and brought immediately thereafter, has instead been brought at a congested and difficult closing stage of the law term.
	


The Crown case at the aborted first trial


	
	A short summary of the Crown case at the last trial is necessary in order to give context to these reasons. The Crown alleges that on 19 July 2013 and into the early hours of 20 July the accused hosted a gathering of friends and relatives at his home at 200 Warren Road, Gilgandra. This is on the corner of Warren Road and Federation Street in that town. Evidence was called to prove that the deceased attended this gathering during the evening of 19 July but left when asked to do so.
	
	
	He returned to the premises not long before 3am on 20 July 2013. At that time, after a physical confrontation between the accused and the deceased outside the front of the house, evidence was given that the deceased moved away from the house on foot across Federation Street. There was further evidence given that the accused then went inside the house to the kitchen and took up a knife. The Crown witnesses said he re-emerged through the front door and ran after the deceased, caught up with him on Federation Street and stabbed him. These witnesses described the deceased then moving across Federation Street and collapsing against a wall of a building on the far side, where he died.
	
	
	According to the post-mortem report, the fatal stab wound was inflicted to the right side of the base of the neck. The knife had passed from there through to the left lung where it terminated in the upper lobe. Vital arteries in the neck were transected as was the trachea. The oesophagus was partly transected. The approximate depth of the wound was 17 centimetres.
	


Principles regarding disqualification for apprehension of bias


	
	The disqualification application was brought on notice of motion filed by my leave in court on 18 December 2015, supported by an affidavit of the accused's solicitor sworn 14 December 2015. This affidavit merely identifies the entire transcript of the trial and states that the solicitor obtained instructions on 9 December 2015 to apply for me to disqualify myself. Such an application is required to be made to and decided by the judicial officer whose recusal is sought: Bainton v Rajski (1992) 29 NSWLR 539 at 544 and 548; Bakarich v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2010] NSWCA 43 at 12.
	
	
	The present application invokes principles relating to apprehended bias. Actual bias is not alleged. This is made clear in the terms of the order sought in the notice of motion as follows:
	


“1. His Honour Fagan J be disqualified from presiding at the trial because of a reasonable apprehension of bias.”


	
	The written submissions filed on behalf of the accused dated 16 December 2015 confirm that the application is based only upon apprehended bias, in this passage at p 3:
	


“That impression, in turn, establishes the possibility that a fair-minded observer might reasonably apprehend or suspect that his Honour had prejudged the case, at least in respect to those aspects”.


	
	The principles applicable to a recusal or disqualification application upon this ground are stated in the following passages. In Ebner v The Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63, (2000) 205 CLR 337 at 344 – 345, the authors of the joint judgment stated as follows (citations omitted):
	


“[6] Where, in the absence of any suggestion of actual bias, a question arises as to the independence or impartiality of a judge (or other judicial officer or juror), as here, the governing principle is that, subject to qualifications relating to waiver (which is not presently relevant) or necessity (which may be relevant to the second appeal), a judge is disqualified if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide. That principle gives effect to the requirement that justice should both be done and be seen to be done, a requirement which reflects the fundamental importance of the principle that the tribunal be independent and impartial. It is convenient to refer to it as the apprehension of bias principle.

[7] The apprehension of bias principle may be thought to find its justification in the importance of the basic principle, that the tribunal be independent and impartial. So important is the principle that even the appearance of departure from it is prohibited lest the integrity of the judicial system be undermined. There are, however, some other aspects of the apprehension of bias principle which should be recognised. Deciding whether a judicial officer (or juror) might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of a question that has not been determined requires no prediction about how the judge or juror will in fact approach the matter. The question is one of possibility (real and not remote), not probability…

[8] The apprehension of bias principle admits of the possibility of human frailty. Its application is as diverse as human frailty. Its application requires two steps. First, it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge (or juror) to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits. The second step is no less important. There must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits… .”


	
	In Johnson v Johnson [2000] HCA 48; (2000) 201 CLR 488 at 492 – 493 the following statements appear in a judgment joined in by five of the justices (citations omitted):
	


“[11] It is not contended that Anderson J was affected by actual bias. It has been established by a series of decisions of this Court that the test to be applied in Australia in determining whether a judge is disqualified by reason of the appearance of bias (which, in the present case, was said to take the form of prejudgment) is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide.

[12] That test has been adopted, in preference to a differently expressed test that has been applied in England, for the reason that it gives due recognition to the fundamental principle that justice must both be done, and be seen to be done. It is based upon the need for public confidence in the administration of justice. ‘If fair-minded people reasonably apprehend or suspect that the tribunal has prejudged the case, they cannot have confidence in the decision’. The hypothetical reasonable observer of the judge’s conduct is postulated in order to emphasise that the test is objective, is founded in the need for public confidence in the judiciary, and is not based purely upon the assessment by some judges of the capacity or performance of their colleagues. At the same time, two things need to be remembered: the observer is taken to be reasonable; and the person being observed is ‘a professional judge whose training, tradition and oath or affirmation require [the judge] to discard the irrelevant, the immaterial and the prejudicial’.”


	
	In Webb v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 74 Deane J listed the different categories of circumstances which might give rise to an apprehension of bias as follows (citations omitted):
	


“The area covered by the doctrine of disqualification by reason of the appearance of bias encompasses at least four distinct, though sometimes overlapping, main categories of case. The first is disqualification by interest, that is to say, cases where some direct or indirect interest in the proceedings, whether pecuniary or otherwise, gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of prejudice, partiality or prejudgment. The second is disqualification by conduct, including published statements. That category consists of cases in which conduct, either in the course of, or outside, the proceedings, gives rise to such an apprehension of bias. The third category is disqualification by association. It will often overlap the first and consists of cases where the apprehension of prejudgment or other bias results from some direct or indirect relationship, experience or contact with a person or persons interested in, or otherwise involved in, the proceedings. The fourth is disqualification by extraneous information. It will commonly overlap the third and consists of cases where knowledge of some prejudicial but inadmissible fact or circumstance gives rise to the apprehension of bias.”


	
	This may not be an exhaustive or exclusive list of the categories, as was observed by the authors of the joint judgment in Ebner v The Official Trustee in Bankruptcy at [23]. The present application is clearly in the second category. It is said that my conduct constituted by portions of the summing-up would give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias in a fair minded lay observer. Specifically, upon this recusal application, criticisms were made of the summing-up on intention, on self defence and on intoxication.
	


The summing-up on intention


	
	First, with respect to intention. The jury, if they were to convict, would have had to infer from circumstantial evidence that the accused had intended either to kill the deceased, John Frail, or to cause him grievous bodily harm. The evidence was capable of satisfying them that the fatal wound was caused by a knife thrust by the accused which entered the base of the deceased's neck and caused the wound which I have described at [19].
	
	
	The Crown put to the jury in final address that they would infer from a stab wound of this nature, which it was not disputed had been delivered by the accused, that he must have intended to kill or at least to cause grievous bodily harm. It may have been significant to the jury's deliberation upon this to consider whether the knife blow which inflicted this wound was delivered whilst the deceased was upright (in which case the accused would have to have raised the knife above the level of the deceased's shoulder and plunged it downward) or whether the blow was sustained when the deceased was in some different posture. I put the cases of the Crown and of the accused respectively about this in the following passages from pp 58 and 59 of the summing-up:
	


“With respect to intention, the Crown’s principal argument was that you would infer that he intended at least to inflict grievous bodily harm but quite possibly to kill and you would be satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt, just from looking at the way that he attacked with the knife, that that – I used the word earlier – that attack bespeaks an intention to inflict at least grievous bodily harm.

…

On the other hand, Mr Nash, first of all with respect to the blow, the fatal blow, said that the Crown’s argument depended upon some assumptions that when the Crown said that the fatal blow was such to bespeak an intention as per the elements I have given you, that in saying that the Crown was assuming that it was a savage downward stroke at the man’s neck and that the evidence would not really persuade you beyond reasonable doubt that that was so, and he referred to the evidence of Stevie Smith and Sharlette Williams, both of whom described a swinging of the arm, both of them gave it in terms of the right arm coming somewhere to the level of the accused’s head, but he said that to infer that that sort of swinging blow was the one that caused the fatal wound and that therefore to strike a man like that and thereby to inflict that wound you would infer the intention that assumes other things, for example, that he was upright, that the deceased was upright when he was hit.”   


	
	The complaint made about the summing-up on the subject of how the deceased received the fatal blow concerns a passage which immediately followed the last of those which I have just quoted. This extended from pp 59 – 60 and is said to exhibit what a reasonable bystander would interpret as bias against the accused:
	


“Now, you are entitled in weighing up those two arguments on that particular point, the inference from the nature of the blow, you are entitled to use commonsense and common knowledge and a consideration to the entirety of the evidence and indeed of things that were not in evidence. Mr Nash referred to the evidence of Rebecca Trudgett which suggested that the knife strike was ahead of herself, but you are entitled to take into account the post-mortem report, which I read earlier. You may conclude from that and from your knowledge of the human body that in the circumstances as described the only way that could have been struck was much as Sharlette Williams and Stevie Smith described. That is not a wound that could be inflicted, you may infer, by a pushing sort of a stroke.

You can reason about it. You can consider well, is there any position of the deceased’s body in which he may have contacted or been contacted by the accused which could have by a pushing stroke led to that. For example, if he had his head down and charged at the accused, that could occur, but you can take into account that nobody has suggested that. There is no evidence to suggest, no description by any witness that the deceased bent forward or put his head down and ran at the accused. The evidence described an altercation in which that sort of suggestion did not arise.”


	
	The criticism made about this is that the impugned passage:
	


“Had the effect of undermining significantly, if not entirely, the arguments put on behalf of the applicant as to other possible circumstances in which the fatal blow was inflicted.”


	
	It was said that this undermining took place by my reference to, amongst other things, the absence of any evidence that the deceased bent down and ran at the accused. But that was an accurate statement on my part. There was not a word of evidence to the effect that the deceased had bent over and run at the accused in a manner which could possibly have caused the fatal blow to result from him running into a knife either held out or thrust out horizontally or near horizontally in front of the accused. Notably, defence counsel had never put such a proposition to any witness.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused submitted the following, on the present application:
	


“While it is accepted that there was no evidence that the deceased 'bent down and ran at the excused', there was evidence that there was an on-going altercation between the two men after they came back together on Federation Street and before the fatal blow was struck. Transcript 316 and 292.”


	
	In oral argument on this application I attempted in vain to elicit from the accused’s counsel what he meant by “an ongoing altercation between the two men” and how, if he could identify evidence which would satisfy that description, it would contradict my reminder to the jury that there was “no description by any witness that the deceased bent forward or put his head down and ran at the accused”. In this sentence I identified to the jury a very specific concept of which I said no witness gave a description. My statement is not rendered erroneous by Mr Nash identifying vague and imprecise generalities in some witnesses’ descriptions of what took place between the two men.
	
	
	The reference, in the passage of the written submission which I have quoted at [32], to the transcript at p 292 seems inappropriate. This is part of the evidence of Karah Towney. There is nothing there that bears on the topic. At pp 289 – 290 there is a relevant passage of Karah Towney’s evidence which I quote:
	


“Q. Now, what happened then, you said he went towards John, what did you next see?

A. Trent swinging him arm.

Q. By this time where were they?

A. (No verbal reply)

Q. Do you need a break Ms Towney?

A. I think they were on the road.

Q. They were on the road by that time?

A. Yeah.

Q. Is that Federation Street?

A. Yes.

Q. And you saw Trent swing the knife?

A. Yes.

Q. What happened next?

A. This is, I don’t know I’m not sure, my memory starts to get a bit--

Q. When he swung the knife did you see whether it hit John or not?

A. No I didn’t see where it hit it, where it hit him.

Q. Were they close together at the time?

A. I think so.

Q. All right. Do you know whether John was facing Trent or facing away at the time?

A. He was facing Trent.”


	
	At T 294 lines 18 – 35 there is another relevant passage of Karah Towney’s evidence, as follows:
	


“Q. You said to the police in your statement ‘John was standing in the middle of the roadway, in that side street, when Trent ran over to him’?

A. Yes.

Q. ‘John was still trying to fight with Trent when he got to him’?

A. Yes.

Q. So, and the next thing – then it says, you said ‘I don’t know why he just didn’t run’?

A. Yes.

Q. And it then says ‘Next thing, I just saw Trent swing his right hand with the knife in it, it looked like he hit John on one of the sides of his torso’?

A. Yes.

Q. And when you gave that statement, that was your best recollection of the events--

A. Yes.

Q. --that had occurred? And can you describe in any more detail what you saw John do that made you say that John was still trying to fight with Trent?

A. Them just both still going towards each other, that’s all I could really remember.”


	
	The last part of Karah Towney’s evidence relevant for present purposes is this, at T 295, lines 1 – 11:
	


“Q. When you describe in your statement John still trying to fight Trent, can you describe that in any more detail?

A. No, just that he wouldn’t leave, and when Trent came back out he went at Trent, like they just, they both just went at each other.

A. Yes.

Q. They came together, both moving forward toward each other, that’s your memory?

A. Yeah.”


	
	These are the nearest passages to the reference given by the accused’s counsel (T 292) that appear to have anything to do with a description of the fatal physical altercation. The effect of them is that the accused went towards the deceased ""swinging his arm"" with the knife in his hand. Karah Towney said that the deceased was facing the accused at the time this occurred. When reminded of the statement she had given police and her evidence at committal she added that the two men had been ""going towards each other"" when this occurred and that John Frail had been “still trying to fight with Trent” and “they both just went at each other”. There is nothing in this which constituted any evidence of John Frail ever adopting any bent over position such as would have been necessary for the fatal knife thrust into his neck to have been made by the accused with a horizontal or pushing stroke. If this is what the accused’s counsel relies upon as evidence “that there was an ongoing altercation” then it has no bearing whatever on the accuracy of the impugned passage of my summing up.
	
	
	The passage at T 316, upon which counsel relies in the extract from his submissions quoted above at [32], is at T 316 line 14 to T 317 line 32. This was evidence of Rebecca Trudgett:
	


“Q. Where was Veronica’s son at the point when Trent ran out with the knife?

A. Well he must have – well, he was still on the grass at the time, but that’s when he, when Trent ran out of the house he must have seen him running towards him and he, that’s when John jumped the railing on the side of the house, onto Federation Street.

Q. All right, so at that point you remember seeing John jump the railing, is that right?

A. That’s right.

Q. Well where was Trent?

A. He was coming behind him.

Q. Behind him. How far from him?

A. Oh, couple of metres behind him I suppose, because once--

Q. And Trent had the knife?

A. Yes.

Q. What happened then?

A. Well as when John jumped over the railing, Trent just sort of ran quickly around the other side of the railing and met him on the road.

Q. And then what happened?

A. Well that’s when they had a bit of a fight and Trent was, yeah.

Q. I appreciate this is difficult, madam, you said that they had a bit of a fight, what exactly took place?

A. Well they were still arguing with each other and whatnot, next minute I guess Trent just started it.

Q. What happened?

A. (No verbal reply)

Q. Just tell us what happened next that you saw?

A. Eventually, Trent, Trent had the knife, he had it in front of him.

Q. Are you okay to go on?

A. Yeah.

Q. Right, Trent had the knife, what did he do?

A. Oh well he pointed it towards John and then I’m sure he might have gave him a couple of whacks.

Q. I’m sorry?

HIS HONOUR: “I’m sure he gave him a couple of”, something.

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. Gave him a couple of whacks was it?

A. Not a whack, he more or less--

Q. Sorry?

A. Stuck the knife out towards him and I think he got him.

Q. What happened then?

A. (No verbal reply)

Q. You say you think he got him with the knife after he stuck it at him a couple of times?

A. (No verbal reply)

Q. What happened then?

A. Well obviously Trend [sic] did – stabbed him a few times.

Q. What happened next?

A. Well after a couple of times Trent leaned the knifed [sic] into him, sort of like, they went towards, over to near the other side of the road.”


	
	This is the evidence that the accused knifed the victim with a pushing stroke having “had the knife… in front of him”, “pointed it towards John” and “a couple of times Trent leaned the knifed into him.” But it contains no description of John Frail having assumed any posture such that knife strokes “in front of” the accused and “out towards” the deceased, whereby the accused “leaned the knifed into him” could have caused the wound which penetrated from the right side of his neck through his trachea to the upper lobe of his left lung. If the jury accepted that knife blows were struck as Rebecca Trudgett described, apparently intended by her to convey that the knife was thrust horizontally in front of the accused, then in the absence of any evidence that John Frail was bent over with his torso more or less horizontal at the time, the jury would not have had any basis upon which to conclude that any of these were the knife strokes which caused the fatal wound.
	
	
	In the passage of my summing up on this issue which is now attacked (see [29]), I referred to the evidence of Sharlette Williams and Stevie Smith. Sharlette Williams observed the final and fatal confrontation between the two men from the front passenger seat of a motor vehicle stationary in Federation Street. She saw the stabbing take place on the roadway near to the left side of the car. She described it as follows at T 202 line 25 to T 203 line 21:
	


“Q. I’m sorry, I beg your pardon, Trent ran from the house--

A. Trent, yes.

Q. --and he jumped the railing?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you see him catch up with John?

A. Yeah. He was there and he stabbed John, I seen it.

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. You saw him stab John, was that once or more than once?

A. Only once and then I put my head down and screamed.

Q. Now you said you saw that he had a knife?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you describe the knife, perhaps as to its size or type that you saw?

A. It was a bit bigger than a kitchen knife, do you know what I mean.

Q. And when you saw him stab, what was the motion that he used? Was it downwards, upwards, sideways?

A. Up.

Q. Sorry?

A. I don’t get it, what do you mean?

Q. Well you said you saw him stab him?

A. Yes. Up, upper, like up.

HIS HONOUR

Q. Perhaps you could just demonstrate the arm action, Ms Williams, could you just move your arm in the way that you remember Trent swinging his arm when he stabbed?

A. Well just over, like that.

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. So it was an, was it an over and downward motion that you’ve just indicated?

A. Yes.

HIS HONOUR: So the witness indicated her right arm, half extended a little bit behind herself and swung over with the hand coming to about head level and then down to John.

Q. Is that right, Ms Williams?

A. Yes.”


	
	Stevie Smith witnessed the event from the driver’s seat of the motor vehicle. At T 163 line 49 to T 165 line 32 she gave this evidence:
	


“A. John was on the left hand side of my car, just in front of the rear vision mirror, on the left.

Q. Near the front mud guard?

A. Yes, so you’ve got the rear vision mirror and then he was sort of standing just in front of there.

Q. Okay. On the road?

A. Yes.

Q. And you said Trent came over the barrier?

A. Yes.

Q. And you saw something in his hand?

A. Yes.

Q. Could you see what it was?

A. No.

Q. And then you said that you saw – did you say you saw him stabbing at John?

A. In the shoulder, in the arm sorry.

Q. What was John doing at that stage?

A. Walking. He was walking around to the front of my car.

Q. Around what around the front of the car?

A. To go in front of my car, but I took off as I saw Trent’s arm go up.

Q. When you say you saw Trent’s arm go up, you lifted your arm, can you demonstrate what you saw of Trent’s arm?

A. Yep, just up like that. I just saw his arm go up like that and that’s when I took off and as I was doing that, as I was driving off, I saw him go in his arm.

Q. So you saw Trent’s arm go up to, if I can describe this for the record, to a position where his hand was near the side of Trent’s head?

A. Pardon?

Q. You said you saw Trent’s arm go up and you raised your arm, when I asked you to demonstrate?

A. Mm hmm.

Q. To a position where your hand was beside your ear, in effect?

A. Yep.

Q. And then you said you started to drive off?

A. Yeah.

HIS HONOUR

Q. Is that what you saw Ms Smith, that his hand came up to about the level of his ear?

A. Yes.

Q. You’d said earlier that you saw, as Trent came over from the house, that he had something in his hand but you couldn’t see what it was?

A. Yes.

Q. And at that point when he raised his hand, could you see whether that was the hand that had something in it?

A. No, pardon?

Q. When he raised his hand, was that the hand that had something in it?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you see what it was at that point?

A. No I didn’t.

Q. And you said that Mr Frail moved around in front of your car?

A. He wasn’t right in front, he was in the motion of moving to the front of my car.

Q. And how far ahead of the front bumper bar of your car was he when he was moving towards crossing the direction in which your vehicle was facing?

A. He would have been on the left hand side right up near my light, but not in front of the light. So just past the front tyre.

Q. I think you said that you started to drive off and it gives a bit of an impression that you might have been nearly about to run him over or is that right or?

A. Can I draw----

Q. How did you move off if he was moving across your path?

A. Well he wasn’t in front of my car, he was still on the side of it near the front tyre, near the front left hand tyre. As he was walking towards there I was driving off.”


	
	In the impugned passage of the summing up at p 59 (quoted at [29] above), when I told the jury that it was open to them to find (“you may conclude…”) that the only way the fatal blow could have been struck was “much as Sharlette Williams and Stevie Smith described” I was referring to the evidence quoted at [40] and [41]. That is, evidence that the accused raised his right hand to a position slightly behind himself and swung the knife over and downward to the victim. Having further reviewed that evidence I am not persuaded that there was any error in telling them that it was open to them to find that the only way the mortal wound, as earlier described, could have been inflicted was by a stabbing action such as described by Sharlette Williams and Stevie Smith and that they could reason to a conclusion that it could not have been caused by a pushing stroke such as described by Rebecca Trudgett unless the deceased had been bent over facing towards the accused, of which there was no evidence.
	
	
	The direction I gave to the jury in the passage quoted at [29] was that there was an absence of evidence of the deceased having assumed a posture which could have resulted in him receiving the fatal blow in any way other than by the type of stroke which the two witnesses, Williams and Smith, described, namely, raising the knife high and plunging it downward. I consider that this observation was fully justified having regard to the relevant passages of evidence the totality of which have been extracted at [34] – [41] above. It was for those reasons that I did not see fit to re-direct upon this – as referred to at [7] and [8] above, where I have mentioned what was said at p 71 of the summing-up.
	
	
	As for apprehension of bias, I fail to see how it would arise out of this aspect of the summing-up. The evidence does not show that I was mistaken in the manner in which I put this to the jury.
	
	
	Even if I had been mistaken, what is it that I would be deciding in the re-trial which this passage might suggest I have pre-judged? If evidence emerges in the re-trial of some other way in which the fatal blow could have been struck, then it would necessitate that I should sum up differently. Even if the evidence should be the same, there is no saying that the issues at the end of the evidence will be the same or that this point will ever be taken. I do not see how any misstatement of the evidence in the impugned passage of the summing up, if there is a misstatement, could be taken by any reasonable bystander to indicate bias.
	
	
	There are numerous statements in the authorities about the extent to which a trial judge may appropriately make comment to the jury upon the evidence. In B v The Queen [1992] HCA 68, (1992) 175 CLR 599 at 605, Brennan J, with whom Mason CJ and Deane J agreed, said this (citations omitted):
	


“A trial judge has a broad discretion in commenting on the facts and in choosing the strength of the language employed in commenting on the facts, but the comment must stop short of overawing the jury. It must exhibit a judicial balance so that the jury is not deprived ‘of an adequate opportunity of understanding and giving effect to the defence and the matters relied upon in support of the defence’.”


	
	In R v Courtney-Smith (No. 2) (1990) 48 A Crim R 49 the Court pointed out (at 56) that the trial judge is entitled to express opinions on the facts provided it is made clear to the jury that factual disputes are exclusively for them to decide. In this case I told the jury many times that factual questions were exclusively for them. In the passages that are complained of I repeatedly stated that they ""may conclude"", or similar, and that they ""can reason about"" the evidence. This was expressed in the orthodox language of a summing up which made it abundantly clear to them that the judgment on these evidentiary and factual points was theirs.
	
	
	In the course of argument on this motion, counsel for the applicant submitted to me that I had told the jury that they ""must"" decide this issue of fact by finding that the fatal knife swing by the accused occurred as described by Sharlette Williams and Stevie Smith. I reject that submission. I did not at any stage tell the jury that they ""must"" decide any factual matter. This is apparent in the transcript of the summing up. Such a direction from me would almost undoubtedly have provoked a request for a re-direction. If I had inadvertently said such a thing and had been made aware of it I would have corrected myself. It would have been completely contrary to a central theme of the summing-up.
	
	
	In R v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355 the following was stated at [87]:
	


“Finally, it may be observed that trial judges should normally refrain from advancing an argument in support of the Crown case that was not put by the Crown. It is one thing to bring to the attention of a jury an alternative lesser count, that is fairly open on the evidence, or an available defence, even though it was not mentioned by the Crown Prosecutor and defence counsel, in their closing addresses, for example manslaughter in a case where the accused was indicted on a count for murder. It is quite another thing for a judge to advance an argument, on behalf of the Crown in support of the Prosecution case, which the judge considers was available, but was either overlooked, or not used by the Prosecution.”


	
	I refer also to the judgment of Blanche CJ in R v Malone (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 20 April 1994, unrep):
	


“In this case it is clear that the remarks complained of were made by the trial judge in the context of criticisms made of the Crown case not foreshadowed during the course of the trial and not anticipated by the Crown Prosecutor in his address. This Court has drawn attention before to the fact that judges may find it necessary to become involved in forensic argument insofar as it is necessary to deal with matters raised by defence counsel who make the last address to the jury – see for example R v O’Donoghue (1988) 34 A. Crim. R. 397, R v William Booth, (C.C.A. (N.S.W.) unreported 29 September, 1993 and R v Gluscheski (1987) 33 A. Crim. R. 193.”


	
	Further in relation to the impugned passage of my summing-up at pp 59 – 60 concerning evidence of the posture of the deceased when the fatal blow was received, the accused now submits:
	


“There was no expert evidence that 'the only way' the fatal injury could have been inflicted was much as Sharlette Williams and Stevie Smith described.”


	
	The absence of expert evidence on the bio-mechanics of what postures the deceased and the accused respectively would have had to assume in any scenario in order for the fatal blow to have been struck did not invalidate what I put to the jury. It was quite appropriate in my view to inform them that they could use their own common sense and apply their own reasoning to work out what postures of the respective parties would have been consistent with such a blow being occasioned and then to consider that against the evidence of Crown witnesses which described the respective movements of the accused and the deceased at various times. The absence of expert evidence does not invalidate the impugned passage.
	
	
	Next it was submitted on this point that:
	


“The singling out of the evidence of Ms Williams and Ms Smith in this important respect highlighted an earlier argument made during the summing-up (but not by the Crown) that they were in a better position to observe the altercation than others at the scene. SU28.”

The expression ""singling out"" is explained further in this passage of the accused's submissions by reference to two other witnesses who had given evidence about, to put it neutrally, the arm actions of the accused at the critical point of the physical confrontation. One of the witnesses referred to by the accused's counsel was Rebecca Trudgett. But I did refer to her evidence in the very passage of the summing up at pp 59 – 60 which is now attacked. I did not “single” the evidence of Sharlette Williams and of Stevie Smith out from that of Rebecca Trudgett. I drew the jury’s attention to the evidence of Rebecca Trudgett and the respect in which it differed from that of the other two.


	
	The other evidence to which the accused's counsel has referred is that of Kade Mackenzie, who was in the rear passenger seat of Stevie Smith's car, stationary in Federation Street, when the fatal altercation took place. His evidence at T 227 lines 5 – 23 is as follows:
	


“Q. All right--

[T 227.6] A. And then that’s when John has, John turned around and Trent’s coming

towards him, he started backing away, and that’s when Trent started

throwing the punches.

Q. Did you see anything in either of the hands of Trent?

A. In his right hand he was holding a knife.

Q. Can you describe it?

A. From memory it was about, I’m not sure of the exact distance, maybe 30 centimetres from handle to the tip.

Q. What, are you talking about the total length of--

A. The knife.

Q. --the knife? Including the handle?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. And what colour was it?

A. I can’t remember the exact colour.

[T 227.25] Q. And you said you saw Trent started throwing punches?

A. Yes.

Q. With what hand?

A. His right hand.

Q. And that was the hand with the knife?

A. Yes.

Q. What was John doing?

A. As John started backing away he tried to, like, defend and hit Trent’s right hand away, as he was backing away.

Q. So he was doing something with his arms, was he?

A. Yes.

Q. What happened next?

[T 227.42] A. After he started throwing punches and backing away, that’s when Stevie

proceeded to drive up to the corner of Bobs Street and called triple 0.”   


	
	The description of ""throwing punches"" which seems to have been attributed to both the accused (at lines 6 and 25) and the deceased (at line 42) is completely general and does not give any description of a knife stroke by the accused which would contradict or qualify the description of the knife stroke given by Sharlette Williams and Stevie Smith. I fail to see how it can meaningfully be said that I “singled out” their evidence regarding the knife stroke from that of Kade Mackenzie when he gave no specific description of any thrust which could possibly have caused the fatal wound, at all. “Throwing punches” with a knife was an empty generality which neither counsel attempted to have clarified by the witness. At T 231 lines 40 – 42 counsel for the accused merely had the witness reiterate this broad description:
	


“Q. You said, sir, that when the two men came back together, you saw Trent throwing punches with the knife in his hand?

A. Yes.”

Counsel for the accused also obtained these answers at T 232 lines 6 – 12:

“Q. And you also saw what you thought was Trent swinging the knife around the other male’s arms or under them?

A. Yes.

Q. You didn’t see – you saw the knife go near the other male’s body, but you didn’t see it actually hit the other male’s body, correct?

A. Correct.”


	
	This was not evidence of actions by the accused which could have caused the fatal wound. “Swinging the knife around [John Frail’s] arms or under them” could not result in a deep penetrating wound from the right side of the neck through the throat to the upper lobe of the left lung. To the extent that the impugned passage of my summing-up “singled out” the evidence of Sharlette Williams and Stevie Smith from these two answers I consider it was entirely appropriate to do so. The subject on which I was attempting to remind the jury of relevant evidence and to instruct them regarding the manner in which it would be open to them to reason with respect to it was the subject of what conclusion they might draw about the nature of the blow which inflicted the critical wound. It would have been an irrelevance and a distraction to include reference to this evidence of Kade Mackenzie (quoted at [54]) which was of other knife strokes immaterial to the matter at hand.
	
	
	As to the complaint (in the submission quoted at [53]) that I ""highlighted an earlier argument made during the summing-up (but not by the Crown)"", the passage at p 28 of the summing-up was in these terms:
	


“Then you have a third category of witnesses who are the three in the car, Stevie Smith driving, Sharlette Williams in the front passenger seat and Kade Mackenzie. When you evaluate the evidence one thing that you may wish to take into account is the different perspectives of these witnesses on critical events.

There have been extended submissions made to you about whether you would find that the deceased moved back towards the accused and that has been raised in the context of whether or not you would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s actions were not self defensive.

Now, you can take the distances and the angles of perspective and so on of the respective witnesses from the sketches of the roadway and so on and you will see that where the car that Stevie Smith drove came round into Federation Street. There does not seem to be any question that it was on the left side of Federation Street and you can see that there is only a short distance therefore between the car wherever exactly it was in the lane and the barrier.

On the other hand, the witnesses who were back towards the front of 200 Warren Street are a somewhat greater distance away and they were viewing the two men as they came together from behind the accused. The three in the car were seeing the accused come towards them so you can take into account those aspects if you like of the geometry of the situation in evaluating the descriptions witnesses have given in weighing up what you think is the relevant opportunity to observe the conflict when it finally occurred on the road, the relative opportunity of those who were in the car looking at the accused as he approached the deceased as against those who were somewhat further away back towards the house looking across towards the accused as he moved away from them.”


	
	This passage does not involve an ""argument made during the summing-up"" at all. It involves the jury being directed that in evaluating the evidence of various witnesses, including conflicting witnesses, it would be appropriate that they take into account the opportunity for observation that the witnesses respectively had. Whether the Crown had referred to this or not, it was my duty as the trial judge to point it out. There were witnesses who had viewed this final confrontation from different angles. Whether defence counsel or Crown counsel said anything about the relative advantage of observation enjoyed by one witness over another, I was bound to point out to them that they should consider this when weighing up the evidence and deciding which witness or which parts of any witness’s evidence they felt they could rely upon. A generic instruction about having regard to witnesses’ opportunities for observation is a standard component of the trial judge’s directions in most criminal trials in this State. I consider it appropriate and desirable to give a direction on this point in specific terms in relation to any factual issue that may be significantly affected by witnesses’ relative opportunities to observe.
	
	
	If, contrary to what I have said above, I was in error at the trial in telling the jury that it was open to them to accept the evidence of Sharlette Williams and Stevie Smith as to the nature of the fatal knife stroke (at summing-up p 59) and in inviting them to consider relative opportunities for observation by the witnesses respectively (at summing-up p 28) and if I am still wrong in the assessment of those matters which I have given here, nevertheless I do not think it would be open to a reasonable bystander to conclude that such error on my part as may be found should give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.
	


The summing-up on self-defence


	
	Secondly, with respect to excessive self-defence. This was not opened by the accused's counsel. I considered that it had to be left to the jury because of the description given by Karah Towney at T 294 – 295 (quoted above at [35] and [36]) of the physical confrontation between the accused and the deceased which occurred in Federation Street immediately prior to the fatal stab wound being inflicted. She said that the deceased ""was still trying to fight Trent"".
	
	
	The fact that self-defence and excessive self-defence had to be left to the jury raised a subsidiary factual question as to whereabouts on the road surface the stabbing had occurred. Depending upon where the jury found that the stabbing had occurred, they might conclude either that the deceased had moved back towards the accused before being fatally stabbed or that he had not done so. Whether the deceased had moved back towards the accused as the latter ran out from his home with a knife might have been considered by the jury to have a bearing upon whether the deceased had acted in a manner from which the accused reasonably apprehended that he would have to defend himself.
	
	
	Defence counsel had addressed the jury on the basis that the position of blood stains on the road indicated the location of the stabbing. Part of my remarks in the summing-up, which is now impugned on this application, was intended to draw the attention of the jury to the circumstance that before they could draw the suggested inference as to where the stabbing had taken place, they would have to consider whether it followed that the location of the blood on the road was the location where the victim had stood when stabbed.
	
	
	The part of the summing up that is criticised in this respect is at summing-up pp 64 – 65, as follows:
	


“Although Kade Mackenzie said that it did not happen, that actually John Frail was backing away, other witnesses did acknowledge that there was at least a step towards. You will recall the evidence that he cited to you of Sharlette Williams that the deceased moved towards the accused putting his arms up and defending himself.

Now in connection with that he relied upon not only in particular the evidence of Karah Towney and that of the witnesses in the car but also the positioning of the bloodstains on the ground. He pointed out that there were a couple of bloodstains on the left-hand white line marking the edge of the bitumen. A larger bloodstain was a bit further out at marker number 4 in the photographs.

In order to rely upon that kind of physical evidence again you have to make some preliminary assessments. The small quantities of blood on the white line you have to, you would have to make an evaluation of whether you think that might have been a spurt or a spatter of blood across to that direction or whether it might have been that the two men actually came together right on that line. You can look at the larger quantity of bloodstaining which is at about marker 4 a bit further out in the laneway, weigh those things up to determine where you think the contact may have been made.”


	
	Counsel now says on behalf of the applicant that there was no evidence of “spurt or spatter”. There did not need to be direct evidence that in fact blood had spurted or spattered from the victim for it to be appropriate to issue to the jury this caution about the use of the circumstantial evidence of the location of blood stains as a basis for inferring the location of the fatal stabbing.
	
	
	This was an orthodox application of the principles governing the use of circumstantial evidence and of the way in which a jury is customarily instructed about these principles. Elsewhere in the summing up I gave a general direction about the use of circumstantial evidence, pointing out, as is usual, that before they drew an inference from circumstances they should ask themselves whether the inference really in logic followed. Here, defence counsel in final address clearly was asking the jury to infer from the presence of bloodstains on the road that the victim had stood at the location of those stains when the stab wounds were inflicted. The jury had to consider whether that really followed or whether it might be possible or even probable that blood might have fallen to the ground at some distance from where the deceased, whose blood it was, was standing when he was struck.
	
	
	What I put to the jury in this instance, as criticised, was not as the accused has now submitted “speculative”. It was a possibility that they needed to consider and it arose as a matter of common sense and everyday knowledge. If drawing to the attention of the jury the fact that they had first to make a decision about whether the blood on the road had fallen directly down from the location of the stabbing or had spurted or spattered from some point more distant had the effect of diminishing the defence argument, then that was because the argument which had been run depended upon an assumption that the blood found on the road after the incident fell directly downward from the point of stabbing. As trial judge, holding the balance between the parties I was not bound to refrain from reiterating, with specific reference to this factual issue, the standard direction that I had elsewhere given the jury as to the proper process of inferential reasoning.
	
	
	In his final address, after reminding the jury of evidence given by eye witnesses about where on the roadway the accused and John Frail had finally come together, defence counsel put this to the jury at T 567/9 – 48 (extracted so far as relevant):
	


“Members of the jury that is all evidence, as I say, that comes from humans. have [sic] said to you already some things about all of that. But what about the crime scene, what was left at the scene? What does that say, objectively, about where these two men came back together?

Well members of the jury, Exhibit A, photograph 32 is a picture of Federation Street with the markers placed, I think, by Officer Cheeseman at points that were relevant to the investigation. The numbers of the markers are on those diagrams that have been given to you at various sizes. I think I am right in saying that the yellow marked to the far left of photograph 32 is marker one. You heard Miss Frail identify that as John Frail’s jumper. You heard the evidence of Kade Mackenzie that that was a jumper, I suggest, that was picked up or that he saw Mr Frail pick up, as he came over the railing and walked towards Federation Street.

Well Officer Austin, I think it was, who was there very shortly after this incident described the jumper being there. That the trail of blood commenced there and went across Federation Street. Officer Cheeseman said that there was blood at marker two and three which are on the far left had [sic] side of Federation Street. His understanding, and there’s no evidence to the contrary, is that all of the blood on Federation [sic] is Mr Frail’s blood. That those two markers are where blood was.

That there was, you remember the evidence about the rain and the covering and so on, but there was a trail of blood, according to Officer Austin, that commences on the far left hand side of the left hand lane as you look at that photograph. There was rain and so but there was – then there is a deal of blood at marker four and the DNA evidence is that that was undoubtedly, the evidence is that all of this blood was Mr Frails [sic]. That blood there was tested and it was confirmed.

Well member so [sic] the jury doesn’t that support, corroborate, give you some objective evidence that if Mr Frail, as Mr Mackenzie described, was on the double painted lines when Mr Towney came over the railing. That what Miss Towney, Miss Karah Towney said that these two men came back at each other is consistent with that. Now there is no evidence about how the jumper got back to the railing but again if what Mr Mackenzie, Kade Mackenzie saw is right, that it was picked up as he came across Federation Street. Well again does that provide some support that the two men came back together as a consequence of Mr Frail coming at Mr Towney.”


	
	This submission completely failed to acknowledge to the jury that it depended upon an assumption that the blood on the ground must have fallen directly vertically from the victim as he stood on the spot where the blood was subsequently found. It was not acknowledged in this passage of the address that any element of inference from this assumed circumstance was involved. As trial judge I was not bound to let this incomplete analysis pass.
	
	
	Again, whether I was right or wrong at the trial to have summed-up to the jury in the manner which I did on the subject of inferring the victim’s position on the roadway from the location of bloodstains and whether I am right or wrong in the analysis of this subject now given in these reasons, it does not appear to me that any reasonable bystander could reasonably apprehend that bias against the accused might underlie the terms in which I put these matters to the jury.
	


The summing-up on intoxication


	
	The third aspect of the summing-up which the accused now complains about as exhibiting a basis upon which bias might be apprehended concerned the degree to which the accused may have been intoxicated at the time when the stabbing took place.
	
	
	On this subject, the Crown had addressed the jury at T 530 lines 6 – 9 as follows:
	


“The question of whether Trent was so intoxicated as to be incapable of forming such an intention or so intoxicated to have some bearing on the question of provocation or the question of self-defence depends on the evidence of but two people. Emma Towney and Rebecca Trudgett.”


	
	The Crown Prosecutor then read from the transcript of evidence of Emma Towney and Rebecca Trudgett, which included Emma Towney’s statement that at some unidentified point during the night the accused “did look intoxicated” (T 242 line 35) and the evidence of Ms Trudgett that, again at an unidentified point in the night, the accused “wasn’t that affected, he was getting a little bit tipsy but that’s about it” (T 311 lines 10 – 11).
	
	
	At T 531 lines 7 and 10 the Crown Prosecutor concluded on this subject as follows:
	


“That is the whole of the evidence on Trent’s intoxication at this trial save and except for what Trent told the police the following morning which was that he was intending to have a party but had gone to sleep instead, he had a few drinks before that.”


	
	In closing address, answering this portion of what the Crown Prosecutor had to say, at T 546 line 34 to T 547 line 6, the following was said by the accused’s counsel:
	


“The other thing that I want to say about intoxication is that what my friend said to you about the evidence of intoxication, and I think he said it more than once, the only evidence of intoxication was Emma Towney and Rebecca Trudgett. Well again member [sic] of the jury that was wrong and it is another reason why you need to consider all of the evidence.

Whalan Williams, the second of the young men that you heard evidence from last week at page 117. These were questions asked by the Crown Prosecutor himself.

“Q. What about Trent was he drinking?

A. Yes.

Q. How was he when you were there, was he drunk or not?

A. Yes.

Q. He was?

A. Yeah.”

So Whalan Williams is more evidence that he was drunk. There’s evidence that there was a lot of alcohol brought. You will remember the evidence of Brody Roach. There’s other evidence that people, everybody was drinking and of course this is 3am, in the early hours of a Saturday after a Friday night.”


	
	In summing-up I reminded the jury of the Crown’s address on the subject of intoxication as follows:
	


“Secondly, the Crown said you would not be deflected from deciding that he had that intention, deciding it beyond reasonable doubt, by evidence about intoxication, because he said that the evidence of the degree of intoxication of the accused at the time of this incident was very scant and was not such as would enable you to conclude that the degree of intoxication would lead you to think that he might as a reasonable possibility not have had the intention which otherwise the knife blow suggests.”


	
	At summing-up pp 60 – 61 I reminded the jury of defence counsel’s argument on intoxication. It is this passage in respect of which complaint is now made to the effect that the reasonable bystander could infer from it that I hold a bias against the accused:
	


“Now, again with respect to intoxication, Mr Nash said there was more. He said there was also the evidence of Whalan Williams, who had described the accused as being drunk. As I pointed out to you earlier in categorising the witnesses, of course Whalan Williams evidence was that he left 200 Warren Road. It seems to be around about midnight, at about the time Karah and Emma Towney arrived. So there is three hours gap between that and this occurrence approximately. You need to consider the evidence which reveals that gap and determine by reference to that what weight you would put on that extra piece of evidence to which Mr Nash has referred to you about intoxication.”


	
	I have mentioned already, at [11] and [12] that a redirection was sought on this and not given (see summing-up pp 69 – 72).
	
	
	It has been pointed out on this application that in the course of summing-up I referred to the evidence of Emma Towney as being to the effect that she had said the accused did not look intoxicated. That was incorrect, as can be seen from T 242 line 35 quoted above at [72]. The Crown had addressed the jury correctly, that Ms Towney had said he did look intoxicated (at T 530). The error on my part was inadvertent. On this application the accused’s counsel has expressly disclaimed any suggestion that a reasonable apprehension of bias could arise from this error. Neither counsel noted my mistake in this respect at the time. There would be no possible inference of bias arising from it.
	
	
	What is said about the passage from my summing-up at pp 60 – 61 is that I “singled out” the evidence of Whalan Williams as the other evidence of the applicant’s intoxication. It is then complained that my reference to the three hours between when Whalan Williams made his observation and the time which was relevant for the jury to ascertain the accused’s state of intoxication suggested to the jury that there was time for the applicant to sober up. As the accused’s counsel put it, “This accordingly added weight to the Crown’s argument, as summarised, that there was very ‘scant’ evidence of intoxication.”
	
	
	This was another instance of my simply pointing out to the jury that they needed to take account of a relevant witness’s opportunity for observation in evaluating his evidence. The Crown had submitted to the jury that the only observers of the accused’s state of intoxication at a time relevant to his formation of the requisite intention were Emma Towney and Rebecca Trudgett. The accused’s counsel had countered with the submission this was wrong, that there were more witnesses – and named Whalan Williams. He was not a witness who had had the opportunity to observe the accused at the time of the fatal confrontation in order to be able to say anything at all about his state of intoxication at that time.
	
	
	It would have been completely misleading for me to have left the jury with this point of disagreement between the Crown and the defence without pointing out that Whalan Williams had not made his observation at a relevant time. To suggest that my doing so “added weight to the Crown’s argument” is a distortion of what occurred.
	
	
	Further, in relation to this point the proposition that I had “singled out” the evidence of Whalan Williams was sought to be made good on the application by suggesting that there was more evidence beyond that of Whalan Williams which had bolstered or perhaps expanded upon the evidence of Emma Towney and Rebeca Trudgett and to which I should have made reference in summing up.
	
	
	Reference was made in argument to the witness Brody Roach. Defence counsel had referred to him in the passage which I have quoted above at [74] when responding to the Crown’s claim that there were only two witnesses relevant to intoxication. But when one looks at the evidence of Brody Roach (T 73 – 104) it provides nothing specific about the degree of intoxication of the accused at the relevant time at all. In addressing the jury counsel had done no more than tell them that they “will remember the evidence of Brody Roach”, without quoting any of it. When summing-up I could not find anything in the evidence of this witness concerning the degree of intoxication of the accused at the time of the fatal confrontation, for the purpose of reminding the jury of it. Brody Roach agreed that “at some point in the evening”, “people were drinking” (T 79). He said people were sitting around in the lounge room drinking (T 81) but he did not notice how much of the drink which had been brought to the premises had been consumed (T 82). In cross-examination Brody Roach said that John Frail was “charged up”, “very drunk” at the time he was asked to leave the party (before returning quite some time later): T 94 – 95.
	
	
	The accused’s counsel in support of this part of his argument suggested that there was a deal of other evidence about large amounts of alcohol being at the premises during the evening, about most people present consuming alcohol and a great deal of drinking going on and so on. This general evidence was not such that the jury needed to be reminded of it, or of which it would have been appropriate for me to remind them, in drawing to their attention the competing arguments of the Crown and the defence about what evidence was available to establish the accused’s degree of intoxication when he stabbed the deceased.
	
	
	The witnesses’ generalities about drinking going on, as now identified by the accused’s counsel, simply could not have been relied upon by the jury to prove anything about how much the accused, in particular, was affected by alcohol shortly before 3am when he stabbed the deceased. To a reasonable bystander properly informed about the evidence, the addresses and the summing-up, it could not be reasonably apprehended that I was actuated by bias pointing out that Whalan Williams’ evidence of the state of the accused’s intoxication was with respect to a time at least three hours too early to be relevant and that there was no other specific evidence about the accused’s state of sobriety at the time of the knife attack which should be taken into account by the jury together with the evidence which the Crown had identified of Emma Towney and Rebecca Trudgett.
	


Conclusion


	
	For these reasons, I consider that no reasonable bystander, understanding the evidence and arguments presented in closing addresses, aware of the contents of my summing-up as a whole and familiar with the duties incumbent on the trial judge in giving the jury their final charge, would apprehend from any of the matters raised by the accused on this application that I would approach the retrial with a bias against him in relation to any matter. There is no basis for any reasonable person with knowledge of the full circumstances to infer that as presiding judge in the retrial I would act out of bias in the manner in which I would direct the jury on any factual issue, in the rulings I might give upon the admissibility of evidence, in the exercise of discretions which might be in my hands with respect to procedural matters, in formulating the law to the jury or in anything else within my province.
	
	
	In considering what has been argued and in reaching this conclusion I have been guided by statements of principle on the application of the law relating to disqualification for bias particularly in respect of criminal trial judges, having regard to their limited decision making role. In R v El-Zeyat [2012] NSWSC 340 Johnson J said:
	


“[21] A judge should not automatically or too readily accede to an application that he or she is subject to a reasonable apprehension of bias and so recuse himself or herself too readily from hearing a matter: Livesey v New South Wales Bar Association [1983] HCA 17; 151 CLR 288 at 294; Johnson v Johnson [2000] HCA 48; 201 CLR 488 at 504 [45]. Although it is important that justice must be seen to be done, it is equally important that judicial officers discharge their duty to sit and do not, by acceding too readily to suggestions of appearance of bias, encourage parties to believe that by seeking the disqualification of a judge, they will have their case tried by someone thought to be more likely to decide the case in their favour: Re JRL; Ex parte CJL [1986] HCA 39; 161 CLR 342 at 352.

[22] A judge is obliged to recuse himself or herself from hearing a matter only if, in the judge's view, there is a real possibility that the judge's participation in a case might lead to a reasonable apprehension of bias: Livesey v New South Wales Bar Association at 294.

[23] Where, as here, reasonable apprehension of bias is said to arise by way of prejudgment, it is necessary to consider the nature and strength of any previous findings which are relied upon in support of the application, and in particular whether the findings concern the credibility of a witness or witnesses: British American Tobacco Australia Services Limited v Laurie at 331-333 [139]-[145]; Michael Wilson & Partners Limited v Nicholls [2011] HCA 48; 86 ALJR 14 at 20-21 [31]-[33], 26-27 [67]-[73]. The hypothetical observer will have in mind the fact that judges are equipped by training, experience and their oath or affirmation to decide factual contests solely on the material that is in evidence in the particular case: British American Tobacco Services Limited v Laurie at 331-332 [140].

…

[27] The application of the relevant principles in the context of a judge-alone trial were considered by the High Court of Australia in Antoun v The Queen [2006] HCA 2; 80 ALJR 497.”


	
	In Balic (No 2) (1994) 75 A Crim R 515 at 520 it was said by Cole JA, Handley and Sheller JJA agreeing:
	


“Here any decision as to guilt or innocence at the trial will not be made by the presiding judge. It will be made by the jury. Nonetheless questions of discretionary admissibility of evidence might arise, and in subtle and sometimes imperceptible ways a judge may influence the attitude of a jury. It is of critical importance that the public and the accused have confidence in the absolute and perceived impartiality of the trial judge.”


	
	Balic (No 2) was cited with approval in R v Kearns [2003] NSWCCA 367 and was cited and applied by Johnson J in R v El-Zeyat.
	
	
	I have taken carefully into account Cole JA’s recognition, in the passage quoted at [88], that there are aspects of the functions of a trial judge in a criminal trial which might be subject to influence by bias, if any were held. For the reasons given, I do not consider it could be reasonably apprehended that, in making decisions of the kind referred to by Cole JA, I would hold or be influenced by any pre-judgment concerning the accused on the basis of the matters put to me on this application. As Johnson J pointed out in El-Zeyat at [29]:
	


“There is no general rule that a new trial must take place before a different judge: R v Lee [2005] QCA 122 at [5]-[7]. The fact that a judge has presided at the first trial of a person, where a retrial is ordered, is no reason of itself for that judge to decline to preside at the second trial. A retrial may occur for many reasons. To conduct a retrial is to conduct the trial which ought to have taken place in the first place: Cornwell v The Queen [2007] HCA 12; 231 CLR 260 at 294-295.”


	
	The orders of the Court are:
	



	
	The accused’s notice of motion filed in Court by leave on 18 December 2015 is dismissed.
	
	
	The retrial of Trent Towney is to proceed before Fagan J at Orange commencing 1 February 2016.

2768559,Humphries v R [2015] NSWCCA 319,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	BELLEW J: On 28 February 2014 Arthur John Humphries (“the applicant”) was jointly indicted with his brother, Mark Wayne Humphries, in respect of the following charges:
	


1.On 10 July 2009, at Seaforth in the State of New South Wales, did break and enter the dwelling house of Elizabeth Kay Cooper, situated at 8 Reid Street, Seaforth, and then in the dwelling house did commit a serious indictable offence, namely larceny, in circumstances of special aggravation, namely that they were armed with an offensive weapon, namely a metal bar, and immediately after wounded Elizabeth Cooper (Count 1);

3.On 11 July 2009, at Penrith in the State of NSW, did attempt to dishonestly obtain for himself and others money, namely $9,500.00, by deception, by causing Lisa Johnson to present to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia a signed and dated personal cheque number 001061 in the name of Elizabeth Cooper (Count 3).


	
	Count 2 in the indictment was brought against the applicant’s brother only, and alleged that between 9 July 2009 and 12 July 2009 he made a statement which he knew to be false in a material particular with intent to obtain money.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the applicant and his brother reached an agreement to break into a house at Seaforth in order to steal property. It was alleged that on the morning of 10 July 2009 the applicant, in furtherance of the agreement, left the western Sydney area where he lived and drove towards the Manly area. Just before 2:00pm on that day Kay Cooper was at her home in Seaforth. The Crown alleged that at about 2:10pm the rear glass door of Mrs Cooper’s house was smashed by one or other (or both) of the applicant and his brother as part of their joint criminal enterprise. Either the applicant or his brother assaulted Mrs Cooper before stealing a number of items from her home. These items included a handbag in which there was a cheque book and a sum of cash. On the following day an attempt was made at a bank located in a shopping centre at Penrith to cash a cheque taken from the cheque book. Both the applicant and his brother were present at the shopping centre when that attempt was made, having travelled there with the person who attempted to cash the cheque.
	
	
	On 29 July 2009 some of the property stolen from Mrs Cooper, including her cheque book and a Bank Card, were found in a garden at Westmead. A DNA profile consistent with that of the applicant’s brother was found on some of the items recovered.
	
	
	Both the applicant and his brother initially pleaded not guilty to all charges and their joint trial proceeded. At the close of the Crown case the trial judge removed the element of special aggravation from count 1. The Crown was granted leave to amend count 1 to read as follows.
	


On 10 July 2009, at Seaforth in the State of New South Wales, did break and enter the dwelling house of Elizabeth Kay Cooper, situated at 8 Reid Street, Seaforth, and then in the dwelling house did commit a serious indictable offence, namely larceny, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that they were in company with one another armed with an offensive weapon, namely a metal bar.


	
	Following that amendment the trial judge was informed that the applicant’s brother proposed to plead guilty to count 1. The Crown agreed to accept that plea in full satisfaction the indictment, with counts 2 and 3 being included on a Form 1. The applicant’s brother was then re-arraigned before the jury and pleaded guilty.
	
	
	The applicant, who maintained his plea of not guilty, made application for a discharge of the jury on the basis that to continue with his trial, in light of his brother’s plea, would be unfairly prejudicial. The trial judge refused that application, and directed the jury (inter alia) that they were not to take the plea of guilty into account in determining whether the Crown had proved its case against the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant was found guilty by the jury of counts 1 and 3. On 4 July 2014, he was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 6 years commencing on 4 September 2012 with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months commencing on 4 September 2012 and expiring on 3 March 2016.
	
	
	The applicant now appeals against his convictions on the following grounds:
	



	
	The convictions are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.
	
	
	The learned trial judge erred in failing to give the jury a direction in accordance with Shepherd v The Queen [1991] HCA 56; (1991) 70 CLR 573.
	
	
	The trial miscarried as a result of the learned trial judge’s error in not discharging the jury in the trial of the applicant, upon his co-accused Mark Humphries changing his plea to guilty before them.
	


THE EVIDENCE IN THE CROWN CASE

The applicant’s association with Melissa Attard


	
	Melissa Jo-Anne Attard (“Attard”) was the registered owner of a white Holden Jackaroo 4WD vehicle (“the Jackaroo”) with a registration number AY 28 KR. According to records obtained from Roads and Maritime Services NSW (“RMS”) the Jackaroo was owned by Attard on and from 12 December 2008 (Exh. AA). She remained the owner of the Jackaroo in July 2009.
	
	
	Exh. AA recorded Attard’s address for the period 7 November 2006 to 20 March 2009 as 27 Helena Avenue, Emerton. A further document obtained from RMS (Exh. Z) recorded the same address for the applicant on and from 3 July 2007.
	
	
	A photograph of the applicant (photograph No. 12 in Exh. DD) showed a tattoo on his forearm which read “Melissa A”. That photograph was taken on 23 February 2011 (T240 L10).
	


Observations of the Jackaroo travelling towards Manly on 10 July 2009


	
	As the project delivery manager of Trans Urban Pty Limited, Christine Johnson managed the collation of images taken of vehicles using certain motorways in and around metropolitan Sydney. She gave evidence (commencing at T159) that she had been provided with the registration details of the Jackaroo and was asked to check for evidence of its presence on the M7 motorway, the M2 motorway and the Lane Cove tunnel between 7:00am on 10 July 2009 and 2:00pm on 11 July 2009. Two photographs produced by Ms Johnson (Exh. R) showed the Jackaroo:
	



	
	exiting the M7 motorway in an easterly direction at 10:48am; and
	
	
	at the toll plaza on the M2 motorway at 11:05am, again travelling in an easterly direction.
	



	
	The direction of the Jackaroo when photographed on each of those occasions was consistent with it travelling from western Sydney (where the applicant lived) towards the area of Manly/Seaforth (where the offending took place).
	


The relevant telephone services


	
	As part of its circumstantial case, the Crown relied upon evidence of the use of various telephones to sustain inferences as to (inter alia) the whereabouts of the applicant at particular times.
	
	
	Telephone service 0414 956 964 (“the 964 phone”) was registered to a person named Kath Humphries of 27 Helena Avenue, Emerton (T237 L25 and following). As noted in [13] above, the RMS recorded this as the applicant’s address. The service provider for the 964 phone was Vodafone. The service commenced on 18 June 2009 (T238 L11-13).
	
	
	On 5 August 2009, the applicant surrendered his phone to Mt Druitt Police in respect of an unrelated matter (T123 L23-32). The phone was examined and a forensic report prepared in relation to the data stored in it (T123 L34-41). Det. Packer, the officer in charge of the investigation, gave evidence (commencing at T229 L25) that the report established that in the “contacts list” for the 964 phone:
	



	
	the full number of the 964 phone was recorded under the initials “AJ” (they being the initials of the Christian and middle names respectively of the applicant);
	
	
	service 0413 889 627 (“the 627 phone”) was recorded under the name “Mark” (that being the Christian name of the applicant’s brother and co-accused);
	
	
	service 0406 158 347 (“the 347” phone) was recorded under the name “Gibbo” which, on the Crown case, was a reference to Brian Gibson (“Gibson”) who was an acquaintance of the applicant.
	



	
	Separate telephone records established that the 347 phone was registered to Gibson (Exh. X; T228 L29 and following).
	


The applicant’s presence in the Manly area on 10 July 2009


	
	Jay Santos, an analyst employed by Vodafone, gave evidence and produced call charge records in respect of the 964 phone for the period 9 July 2009 to 12 July 2009 (T155 L20-45; Exh. Q). In respect of the calls listed on Exh. Q (other than those identified as having been diverted to voicemail) Mr Santos said that:
	



	
	entries under the heading “Location Description” recorded the details of the cell tower through which the call originated; (T156 L8-18);
	
	
	entries under the heading “Charged Party Number” recorded the number of the service charged for the call (T156 L27-29);
	
	
	entries under the heading “Local Call Start Date” recorded the date on which the call was made (T156 L31-33);
	
	
	entries under the heading “Local Call Start Time” recorded the time of the call (T156 L35-36);
	
	
	entries under the heading “Non-Charged Party Number/APN” recorded the number called (T156 L38-39); and
	
	
	entries under the heading “IMEI ID” recorded the number of the handset being used by the “charged party”, i.e., the party making the call (T156 L49-50).
	



	
	As to [21](vi), not all of the calls recorded in Exh. Q have an accompanying IMEI ID recorded. However where it is recorded, the number is 355243022994400. Det. Packer gave evidence (commencing at T229 L25) that the forensic report obtained in relation to the 964 phone recorded the IMEI ID of the handset surrendered by the applicant as 35524302299440\1 (T229 L34-35). That number corresponds with the IMEI ID of the 964 phone on Exh. Q, but for the last digit. No issue appears to have been taken at the trial in respect of this discrepancy.
	
	
	Mr Santos also gave evidence (T156 L41-43) that some entries on Exh. Q indicated occasions on which calls were diverted to voicemail. He explained that in respect of these diverted calls:
	



	
	the entry under the heading “Other Party Number” recorded the service attempting to make the call (T158 L1-3);
	
	
	the entry under the heading “Charged Party Number” recorded the service which received the call (T 157 L14-34); and
	
	
	the entry under the heading “Location Description” recorded the details of the cell tower through which the call was received (T157 L15-22; T158 L1-23).
	



	
	By reference to his explanation of the entries on Exh. Q, Mr Santos gave unchallenged evidence that:
	



	
	at 8:33am on 10 July 2009 the 627 phone called the 964 phone, with the call being diverted to voicemail through a tower at Dharruk in western Sydney (Exh. Q at p. 4; T157 L15-50);
	
	
	at 12:50pm on the same day the 627 phone called the 964 phone, with the call being diverted to voicemail through a cell tower located at Manly (Exh. Q p. 4; T158 L1-13);
	
	
	at 1:23pm on the same day a telephone service 0409 038 195 (the subscriber of which was not identified) called the 964 phone, with the call being diverted to voicemail through a cell tower located at Manly.
	



	
	In each of those instances the IMEI ID was the number ending in 4400 as set out in [22] above.
	
	
	Han Chew was the national coverage and planning manager for Vodafone. He gave evidence (commencing at T166 L20) that he was familiar with the mode of operation of mobile cell towers. He said (commencing at T166 L49) that in broad terms, a cell tower located closest to the handset which is used to make a call acquires the necessary signal and facilitates a link being made to the service which that party is trying to call. He further explained (at T167 L3 and following) that the cell tower located closest to the handset receiving the call establishes the connection. He said that the range of coverage of cell towers in a metropolitan area was 2 to 3 kilometres and that the precise range was dependent upon factors such as the level of the density of housing, the presence of surrounding buildings and the general terrain of the area.
	
	
	Exhibit T was a map depicting the location of cell towers in an area designated as “Manly”. The distance between the tower designated on Exh. Q as “Manly” (which was located in Central Avenue, Manly) and the premises at 8 Reid Street, Seaforth where the offending occurred (“the Reid Street premises”) was approximately 3.2 kms (T226 L25-42).
	


The location of the offence


	
	Reid Street, Seaforth formed an intersection with Peacock Street (Exhs. C and D). Peacock Street ran generally in an east/west direction (Exh. D). The Reid Street premises were located on the corner of Reid Street and Peacock Street (Exh. D). The premises at 28 Peacock Street (“the Peacock Street premises”) were located approximately 110 metres to the east of the Reid Street premises.
	


The CCTV footage taken from the Peacock Street premises


	
	A CCTV camera was mounted at the front of the Peacock Street premises (T7 L43 and following) and footage taken from it was contained in Exhs. J and K at the trial. The footage in Exh. K was shown to this Court and I have since viewed it on several occasions. I have also viewed the footage in Exh. J. Still photographs (Exh. E) were taken from Exh. J.
	
	
	Exh. J contained two separate “chapters” of footage, the first being of 60 seconds duration and the second of 180 seconds duration. Both chapters depict a white 4WD vehicle travelling in Peacock Street from west to east. Still images of that vehicle as it travelled past the Peacock Street premises were Exh. E. Detective Packer explained (T9 L4-23) that the first of those images depicted the vehicle at 1:36pm on 10 July (and is taken from chapter one of Exh. J),and the second depicted the vehicle at 1:57pm on the same date (and is taken from chapter 2 of Exh. J).
	
	
	Adam Calvi was a stonemason who, in July 2009, was carrying out work at the Peacock Street premises. At the commencement of the footage in Exh. K Mr Calvi was seen to emerge from the premises, turn right, and walk in a westerly direction along Peacock Street towards his vehicle. Shortly afterwards, two men walked in the same direction towards Reid Street. Both wore white t-shirts. The person on the right in the footage wore a “bum bag” around his waist and on the Crown case this was the applicant’s brother. The person on the left wore a white short sleeved t-shirt with a motif/logo on the back, knee length shorts and white coloured “jogger” shoes that had coloured trim. On the Crown case, this was the applicant. Still photographs taken from the CCTV footage depicting the two men were Exh. F.
	
	
	As the two men passed the vehicle to which Mr Calvi had walked, Mr Calvi began to walk back down Peacock Street. In doing so, he passed the two men. Mr Calvi gave evidence of these events and said (commencing at T78 L20):
	


“… a little before 2 o’clock I took some tools up to my ute. I walked to my ute and put them in there and when I was walking back towards the house, that’s when I noticed two gentlemen walking towards me. They were on the footpath which ends at the driveway there. They then walked onto the road. I remember the first guy I described, he’s probably mid, mid 20’s, light brown hair. He’s roughly my height. I remember he had short light brown hair. I remember his left forearm, I thought there was a tattoo, could have been dirt or grease but there was definitely a pattern on his forearm. And the second guy I described, he’s probably around my height, short black to brown hair. He’s a bigger build, yeah. I remember walking along the street and they walked up onto the road, we were within about a metre of each other. The second guy I described with the dark hair, said to me something the along the lines of “Good day to be working” and I said “Yep” and kept walking towards the house. I then walked to the front of the house and I grabbed a paper out of the recycling bin that I’d put in earlier, and I stayed there reading the paper, waiting for the resident to get home because I was waiting to get paid. Then roughly about 15 to 20 minutes, the second guy with the darker hair that I’d described, came walking past, like he was rushing past me, he had a plastic bag out in front of him rushing past me and then I saw the second gentleman with the lighter coloured hair walking down the street slowly. He walking like that as if he had something under his shirt.”


	
	Mr Calvi described the person who initially spoke to him as having a “westie” accent and said (commencing at T79 L8) that the person who rushed past him 15 to 20 minutes later appeared to have a “bulge” consistent with carrying something under his shirt.
	
	
	Mr Calvi said that he saw the person who rushed past him walk 30 metres back down Peacock Street and get into the passenger seat of what he described as a “dark brown 4WD” (at T81 L41) which was parked about 20 to 30 metres to the east of the Peacock Street premises. Mr Calvi was not able to describe the make and model of that vehicle but said (at T82 L2) that he thought that the first two characters on the number plate were “A7” or “AZ”. As noted previously, the registration number of the Jackaroo was AY 28 KR. Mr Calvi said (commencing at T82 L16) that he had noticed that the number plate on the vehicle parked in Peacock Street was yellow with black writing and was a “newer style number plate with the like 2-2, 2-2 digits”. He clarified (at T82 L26) that the characters on the number plate were broken into three groups of two (as opposed to two groups of three).
	


The commission of the offence


	
	The victim of the offence, Kay Cooper, gave evidence (commencing at T30 L5) that on 10 July 2009 her son, daughter-in-law and youngest grandson had left the Reid Street premises at about 2:00pm to go shopping. Mrs Cooper remained at the premises with her other grandson, who was then two years of age. She said (commencing at T31 L6) that she was upstairs when she heard a “rustling” sound (at T31 L13). She said that she went into the bathroom through the main bedroom, and that upon exiting she came face to face with an intruder who was walking in. She described that man (commencing at T31 L42) as “European, about 5’6, dark hair, and a light coloured t-shirt and shorts”. By “European” Mrs Cooper explained (at T32 L11) that the man had dark hair but a fair complexion. She said described him (at T32 L18) as being in possession of a “metal rod”.
	
	
	After Mrs Cooper asked the intruder what he was doing she was punched in the stomach (T32 L50). She said (at T33 L15) that this occurred a couple of times, causing her to fall to the floor. She said (commencing at T33 L28) that the man was looking in the cupboards. He asked where he could find money. Mrs. Cooper told him that it was all in her handbag (which she said was over the man’s arm). She said (commencing at T34 L13) that she thought that there was approximately $500.00 in cash in the bag, along with a Medicare card, a driver’s licence and a cheque book. She explained that the account to which the cheque book attached was held at the Commonwealth Bank (at T34 L30-31).
	
	
	Mrs Cooper said (commencing at T34 L38) that the man then asked her to direct him out of the premises. She directed him through the back door. The man then kicked Mrs Cooper in the head several times before leaving (at T34 L42 – T35 L43). After waiting on the floor for a short period to make sure he had gone Mrs Cooper got up and telephoned 000. The transcript of the call was Exh. M and the account of the incident given by Mrs Cooper to the 000 operator was generally consistent with that which she gave in evidence. When asked by the 000 operator to describe the person who attacked her (at page 2 of Exh. M) Mrs Cooper described him as being in his twenties, Australian, and wearing what she thought was a white and blue t-shirt and light coloured shorts. She thought that he had “brown-y” coloured hair which was short and was of medium build and medium height. She confirmed (at page 5 of Exh. M) that he was in possession of a metal bar which he was carrying when he left the premises.
	
	
	Mrs Cooper was later shown a photograph of a cheque numbered 1061 relating to an account held at the Commonwealth Bank at Balgowlah in her name. The cheque was made out to cash in a sum of $9,500.00 and dated 10 July 2009. Mrs Cooper said (commencing at T40 L6) that she recognised the cheque as one issued to her by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. She said that she did not recognise the handwriting and that the signature was not hers. She confirmed (commencing at T43 L43) that some months after the incident she was asked to look at a number of photographs by police but was not able to identify or recognise the person who she had seen in her premises on 10 July (T44 L16 to 19).
	


Contact between the applicant and Gibson


	
	Records relating to the 347 phone operated in the name of Gibson were Exh. X at the trial. The records were tendered by consent through Det. Packer (commencing at T228 L29). Accordingly, unlike Exh. Q, there was no evidence from any representative of the relevant service provider which explained how the entries on Exh. X were to be interpreted.
	
	
	Included in Exh. X are two columns headed “A Number” and “B Number” respectively. Between 12:48am and 12:51am on 11 July 2009 the 964 phone is recorded as the “A Number” on 9 separate occasions. In each case the corresponding “B Number” is the 347 phone. A separate column headed “Conv” appears to record the duration of calls made. In the case of each of these nine entries, the entry under the heading “Conv” is “00 00:00:00.0”.
	
	
	In written submissions the Crown argued that these entries in Exh. X were evidence of the fact that between 12:48am and 12:51am on 11 July 2009 the applicant had appeared to “urgently initiate contact with Brian Gibson”. That proposition assumed, in the case of each of the 9 corresponding entries in Exh. X, that the “A Number” designated the calling party and the “B Number” designated the party receiving the call. Whilst that might reflect a common sense approach to the interpretation of Exh. X, the Crown was unable to point to any evidence which established that the assumption was in fact correct. The Crown’s submission in this respect overstated the evidence. Of itself, Exh. X establishes nothing more than the fact that there was repeated attempted contact (which was not successful) between the 964 phone and the 347 phone during that 3 minute period. There were, however, available inferences to be drawn from that fact which I have discussed further below.
	


The events of 11 July 2009


	
	Lisa Johnson gave evidence (commencing T186 L11) that on 11 July 2009 she was at home when she was approached by a lady she knew by the name of “Kay”, following which she spoke to a man known to her as “Gibbo” (whose photograph she identified as Exh. H). There was no dispute that “Gibbo” was Gibson.
	
	
	Ms Johnson said (commencing at T187 L17) that Gibson had asked her if she would “cash a cheque, his partner’s cheque for him, he wanted to buy a car”. She agreed to do so. She said that she asked him if “everything was above board, if it was all okay” and that “he assured (her) it was” (T187 L25 to 26).
	
	
	Ms Johnson then travelled to Penrith Plaza Shopping Centre in a car with Gibson and a female whom she believed was Gibson’s partner (T187 L42 to 49). She explained (commencing at T188 L33) that the vehicle stopped at Cambridge Gardens on the way to collect two males who were not otherwise known to her. She could not describe them, and said that there was no conversation about depositing a cheque into her bank account. There was no issue at the trial that these two males were the applicant and his brother.
	
	
	Ms Johnson said (commencing at T189 L26) that having arrived at Penrith Plaza she, Gibson, the appellant and the appellant’s brother got out of the car, walked across the road, and entered the complex. Ms Johnson then walked to the vicinity of the Commonwealth Bank with Gibson, whilst the applicant and his brother went in a different direction. Ms Johnson said (commencing at T189 L40) that she had been given a cheque by Gibson which he had been given by one or other of the applicant or his brother when they were outside Penrith Plaza. No DNA, nor any identifiable fingerprints, were detected on the cheque (T247 L26-37).
	
	
	Ms Johnson said (commencing at T190 L13) that she did not look at the cheque, but took it into the Commonwealth Bank inside Penrith Plaza. She asked the teller, Kate Harper, whether she could cash the cheque through her account. Ms Harper informed her that because of the large amount, approval would have to be obtained and that she would make a call (T97 L1-20; T191 L5). When Ms Harper returned, she informed Ms Johnson that she had been unable to get in contact with the account holder and that she would deposit the cheque into Ms Johnson’s account (T97 L14-27; T191 L13-19). Ms Johnson was then given a receipt which she later handed on to Gibson. After Ms Johnson had left the bank, Ms Harper and her manager cancelled the cheque (T99 L4-6). Both Ms Johnson and Ms Harper identified Exh. N as a copy of the cheque which she presented at the bank (T96 L45 – T97 L2; T192 L9 to 11).
	
	
	Gibson had remained outside the bank whilst Ms Johnson was inside. When Ms Johnson came out, she walked back across the road to the car (T193 L5). A few minutes later Gibson, the applicant and his brother joined her and together they left Penrith Plaza in the same vehicle as that in which they had arrived. On the return journey, Gibson, the applicant and his brother got out of the car at Cambridge Gardens (T193 L10-31). Ms Johnson said that there was no discussion in the car about what had occurred at the bank, but that she told Gibson that the cheque had been deposited into her account. Gibson asked for Ms Johnson’s account card so as to allow him to withdraw the money once the cheque had cleared. Ms Johnson gave Gibson her card along with the receipt for the deposit of the money (T193 L44-50).
	
	
	Ms Johnson said that one of the men who had been picked up at Cambridge Gardens had told her that he was the person purchasing the car (commencing at T194 L15). She said (commencing at T194 L34) that Ms Harper had indicated to her that the cheque would take three days to clear and that she had not met with Gibson at any stage in order to retrieve her card.
	
	
	CCTV footage taken from Penrith Plaza was Exh. L and still images taken from the footage were Exh. G. There was no dispute that both the applicant and his brother were at the Penrith Plaza when Johnson was trying to cash the cheque, nor was there any dispute that they were seen on the CCTV footage.
	


The recovery of stolen items


	
	On 29 July 2009 a number of the items stolen from Mrs Cooper, including some cheques, two Mastercards and one other card, were handed to police after being found in a garden bed outside premises in Westmead (T230 L3-33). DNA recovered from one of the cheques and the Bank Card was consistent with that of the applicant’s brother (Exhs. O and P; T116 L12-T118 L50).
	


GROUND 1 – THE CONVICTIONS ARE UNREASONABLE AND CANNOT BE SUPPORTED HAVING REGARD TO THE EVIDENCE

Submissions of the applicant


	
	Counsel for the applicant described the Crown case as “quite weak”. Although he acknowledged that it was accepted at the trial that one of the persons seen by Mr Calvi in Peacock Street was the applicant’s brother, counsel emphasised that there was no evidence which identified the applicant as being the other person, and that there was no scientific evidence which linked the applicant to the commission of the offence.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that the Crown case was based largely on evidence of the movements of the Jackaroo, and the use of the 964 phone. As to the first of those matters, counsel for the applicant pointed out that Ms Attard did not give evidence at the trial, and that accordingly there was no direct evidence of why the Jackaroo was travelling in the general direction of Manly on the morning of 10 July. He also pointed out that there was no direct evidence of the applicant travelling in the Jackaroo at that time. Whilst counsel appeared to concede that it was open to the jury to accept that the Jackaroo was the vehicle seen in Exhs. E and J driving along Peacock Street on two separate occasions shortly before 2:00pm on 10 July, he again submitted that there was no evidence that the applicant was in that vehicle at that time. He also pointed to the fact that at the time that the Jackaroo was photographed on the M2 and M7 motorway, a P plate was affixed to it in circumstances where the applicant’s brother held a provisional licence (and was thus required to display a P Plate), but where the applicant’s licence had been cancelled.
	
	
	As to the evidence of the use of telephones, counsel submitted that the absence of any evidence establishing that the 964 phone was in the possession of the applicant at any relevant time was critical. He submitted that absent such evidence, the Crown could not establish that the applicant was in fact using the phone on any occasion, and thus could not establish that the applicant was in a particular place at a particular time.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant also made a number of submissions regarding the events leading up to the applicant’s presence at Penrith Plaza on 11 July, and the events which took place on that day. He submitted that although such evidence supported count 3 against the applicant, it was a “longer bow” to rely upon that evidence in support of count 1. Ultimately, counsel appeared to accept that the evidence was relevant to count 1, but submitted that it was of little or no weight.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown accepted that the case against the applicant was circumstantial. However, it was pointed out that it had been accepted at the applicant’s trial that the two men shown in the CCTV footage from Peacock Street had committed the offending in count 1, and that the applicant’s brother was one of those men.
	
	
	Bearing this in mind, the Crown submitted that there were four particular areas of circumstantial evidence which, when viewed in the context of the Crown case as a whole, were capable of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offences in both count 1 and count 3. In broad terms, these areas of evidence related to:
	



	
	the use of the various phones;
	
	
	the movements of the Jackaroo;
	
	
	the description given by Mrs Cooper when compared with the images on CCTV footage; and
	
	
	the events leading up to, and at, at Penrith Plaza.
	



	
	On the basis of this evidence, the Crown submitted that the case against the applicant was a compelling circumstantial case made up of an accumulation of detail. It was submitted that an independent assessment of such evidence would lead this Court to conclude that it was clearly open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had committed both offences.
	


The relevant principles


	
	Before dealing with the substance of this ground it is appropriate to set out the general principles which this Court must apply when it is asserted that the verdict of a jury is unreasonable. It should also be noted that because ground 1 does not involve a question of law alone, the applicant requires leave to appeal pursuant to s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912; Rasic v R; Vella v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12] per Johnson J (Basten JA and RA Hulme J agreeing).
	
	
	The fundamental question for the purposes of ground 1 is whether, on the entirety of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the applicant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at [493]; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [25]; [55]; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 at [11]; [14]. The relevant principles set out in these authorities were summarised by Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom RA Hulme and Fagan JJ agreed) in Swain v R [2015] NSWCCA 176 commencing at [87]:
	


[87] The question for the Court is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offences in counts 1 – 3. This is a question of fact. In considering this ground, the Court must undertake its own assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence. In M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 the plurality (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ) said:

“7 Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence

to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses.”

[88] The test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in MFA v The Queen at [58]. McHugh, Kirby and Gummow JJ said that the reference to “unsafe or unsatisfactory” in M v R is to be taken as “equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as “unreasonable” or such as “cannot be supported having regard to the evidence”.

[89] These principles were restated by the majority of the High Court in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 as follows:

“13 The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses[5]. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""

…”

[90] In W v R [2014] NSWCCA 110 Bathurst CJ (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J agreed) said on the same issue:

“151 It is not enough for the verdict to be unreasonable that a review of the evidence shows only that it was possible for the jury (or in this case the trial judge) to reach a different conclusion. That was made clear by Hayne J in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559. In a passage with which Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreed, his Honour made the following remarks:

""[113] It is clear that the evidence that was adduced at the trial did not all point to the appellant's guilt on this first count. But the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt. It is not sufficient to show that there was material which might have been taken by the jury to be sufficient to preclude satisfaction of guilt to the requisite standard. In the present case, the critical question for the jury was what assessment they made of the whole of the evidence that the complainant and the appellant gave that was relevant to the issue of consent to the digital penetration that had occurred in the park. That evidence did not require the conclusion that the jury should necessarily have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt.""

(Emphasis in the original, citations omitted).

152 However, it is not sufficient that there was evidence on which a jury could convict. So much is made clear in the passage from M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487, cited in SKA v The Queen supra at [13]. If, after giving full weight to the primacy of the jury, the court is left in reasonable doubts as to the verdicts, it is only where the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt, the court can conclude there was no miscarriage of justice (see also MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [26] and [55]-[56]).”


	
	It was not open to the jury to return a verdict of guilty unless the evidence was capable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the circumstances were such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused: Barca v The Queen [1975] HCA 42; (1975) 133 CLR 82 at [104]; Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21; (2012) 84 NSWLR 581 at [50] to [53]. At the same time, it is essential to bear in mind that a circumstantial case must be considered in its totality, and not in a piecemeal way: R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618 at [48] to [49] per Gummow, Hayne and Crennan J. Finally, the burden of proving that appellate interference is warranted is upon the applicant: Mackenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 370. Accordingly, the applicant must identify aspects of the evidence which are said to be unreliable: Lee v R [2013] NSWCCA 68; (2013) 232 A Crim R 337 at [190].
	


An analysis of the evidence


	
	At 8:33am on 10 July 2009 a call was made from the 627 phone to the 964 phone at a time when the 964 phone was in the vicinity of a cell tower located at Dharruk. Dharruk is a suburb in the west of Sydney. The records produced from the RMS recorded the applicant’s address as being at Emerton, which is also a suburb in the west of Sydney. Counsel for the applicant correctly pointed out that there was no direct evidence that the applicant was in possession of the 964 phone at any particular time. However, there was evidence that:
	



	
	the 964 phone service was registered in the name of a person who shared the same surname as the applicant, and who lived at the same address;
	
	
	the applicant had surrendered the handset for the 964 phone to the police;
	
	
	the contact list in the 964 phone recorded the full number of the phone against an entry of “AJ”, these being the initials of the Christian and middle names of the applicant;
	
	
	the contact list similarly recorded the full number of the 627 phone against an entry of “Mark” who was the applicant’s brother and co-accused.
	



	
	In my view, it was clearly open to the jury to infer from a combination of these circumstances that at all relevant times relied upon by the Crown, the applicant was the user of the 964 phone and his brother the user of the 627 phone. It follows that the jury were entitled to infer that at 8:33am on 10 July 2009 the applicant was telephoned by his brother at a time when he (the applicant) was in the western suburbs of Sydney.
	
	
	The applicant had an obvious association with Attard. Quite apart from the name tattooed on his forearm (which, it could be inferred, was a reference to Attard) RMS records established that the applicant and Attard shared an address for a period of time. On two separate occasions on 10 July 2009 the Jackaroo, which was registered to Attard, was seen to be travelling in an easterly direction. That would place the vehicle, generally speaking, travelling from the west of Sydney (being the area where the applicant lived and where it was open to infer (from Exh. Q) he had been earlier that morning) towards Manly.
	
	
	In the course of oral argument before this Court counsel for the applicant made much of the fact that Attard was not called by the Crown to give evidence at the trial. The absence of Attard obviously meant that there was no direct evidence from the owner of the Jackaroo. However, the fact that Attard was not called to give evidence did not prevent the jury from drawing inferences from the other evidence relied upon by the Crown. The jury were entitled to infer, based upon the evidence to which I have referred above and which commences with the call to the 964 phone at 8:33 am, that the applicant was driving the Jackaroo from the western suburbs of Sydney where he lived, towards Manly, on the morning of 10 July. That inference is strengthened by some of the other evidence I have discussed below. It was also open to the jury to infer, from the circumstances in [61] and [62] above, that the applicant was in the Manly area when calls were made to the 964 phone at 12:50pm and again at 1:23pm, and that the first of those calls was made by the applicant’s brother from the 627 phone.
	
	
	The photographs taken on the M7 and M2 motorways (Exh. R) establish that the Jackaroo:
	



	
	was white;
	
	
	had a registration number AY 28 KR;
	
	
	had a distinctive “open” style roof rack which covered almost the entirety of the area of the roof;
	
	
	had a “bull bar” at the front; and
	
	
	had a separate window at the rear right hand (driver’s) side, located immediately behind the rear door.
	



	
	Exhs. E and J established that the vehicle seen travelling down Peacock Street from the direction of Reid Street at 1:36pm, and again at 1:57pm, on 10 July 2009:
	



	
	was a 4WD;
	
	
	was white;
	
	
	had an open style roof rack which covered almost the entirety of the roof area;
	
	
	had a “bull bar” at the front; and
	
	
	had a separate window at the rear left hand (passenger’s) side, located immediately behind the rear door (Exh. R showing a similar window in the corresponding position on the driver’s side).
	



	
	It follows that the vehicle seen driving along Peacock Street on two occasions shortly before 2:00pm had a number of characteristics in common with the Jackaroo.
	
	
	Mr Calvi identified a 4WD parked in Peacock Street with a registration number which he thought began with “A7” or “AZ” and which he thought was brown. The registration number of the Jackaroo commenced with “A”, although not with the combination of which Mr Calvi gave evidence.
	
	
	Mr Calvi first saw the two men to whom he referred in his evidence “a little before” 2:00pm. He saw the same two men he saw walking back down Peacock Street towards the location of the parked 4WD a short time later, one of whom appeared to be trying to conceal something under his shirt. The times at which Mr Calvi made these observations are generally consistent with the time at which the white 4WD was seen travelling in Peacock Street.
	
	
	In my view, and consistent with the other inferences I have identified as being open to the jury to draw, it was also open to the jury to conclude that the white 4WD seen travelling down Peacock Street in the period leading up to 2:00pm was the Jackaroo, and that the applicant was in it at the time. The timing is significant, given the evidence of Mrs Cooper that the offence occurred after her son and his family had left the Reid Street premises around 2:00 pm, and given Mr Calvi’s evidence that he first saw the two men walking towards the Reid Street premises a little before 2:00pm.
	
	
	As counsel for the applicant correctly pointed out there was no positive identification made of the applicant. However, it was open to the jury to conclude that the appellant and his brother, who were accepted as being in the CCTV footage at Penrith Plaza, were of similar build to those persons seen in the CCTV footage taken from the Peacock Street premises, one of whom was accepted to be the applicant’s brother.
	
	
	There is evidence of contact between the 964 phone and the 347 phone in the early hours of 11 July 2009. The evidence established that the 347 phone was registered to Gibson and for the same reasons as those I have previously set out in respect of the 964 phone, it was open to the jury to infer that Gibson was using that phone in the early hours of 11 July. As I have already pointed out, the Crown’s submission that it was the 964 phone which was attempting to contact the 347 phone at this time (rather than the other way around) overstated the evidence. However, there remained an inference available from Exh. X that there was repeated attempted contact between the applicant and Gibson over a concentrated period in the early hours of 11 July. That inference was strengthened by the undisputed evidence that only a matter of hours later:
	



	
	a car in which Gibson was travelling collected the appellant and his brother;
	
	
	they travelled, with Gibson and Ms Johnson, to Penrith Plaza;
	
	
	Gibson gave Ms Johnson a cheque to cash which had been given to him by the appellant or his brother;
	
	
	the cheque was one which had been stolen from Mrs Cooper the day before;
	
	
	Ms Johnson tried to cash the cheque whilst the appellant and his brother remained at Penrith Plaza;
	
	
	when Ms Johnson emerged from the Bank, the appellant and his brother left with her and Gibson.
	



	
	In my view, the evidence of these events was significant, not only in respect of count 3 but also in respect of count 1. Contrary to what was submitted by counsel for the applicant, taking this evidence into account as part of the overall circumstantial case in support of count 1 does not involve an impermissible process of ex post facto reasoning. It forms part of the evidence upon which the jury were entitled to conclude that the applicant was one of the persons present at Mrs Cooper’s home on the previous day.
	
	
	On the whole of the evidence, and drawing the inferences I have identified, it was open to the jury to find each of counts 1 and 3 established beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Whilst I would grant leave to appeal, I would reject ground 1.
	


GROUND 2 – THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN FAILING TO GIVE THE JURY A DIRECTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS SHEPHERD V R [1990] HCA 56; (1990) 170 CLR 573

The determination of the trial judge


	
	Prior to the summing up (commencing at T421 L21) counsel for the applicant at trial had the following exchange with the trial judge:
	


“Counsel:   Could your Honour think about this. Again pivotal to the Crown case is this Attard car, the Attard four wheel drive, I’d respectfully suggest that the jury would have to be satisfied of that matter beyond a reasonable doubt before they could convict.

Her Honour:   What matter.

Counsel   That the car that the men travelled to and from that day was in fact Melissa Attard’s car. I raise it for your consideration.

Her Honour:   In order for them to take it into account as a circumstance it’s a circumstance that they would have to be satisfied about beyond reasonable doubt, why, why?

Counsel:   Beyond reasonable doubt – because it’s such a large or major plank of the crown case, I’d suggest.

Her Honour:   No, it’s not. It’s just another circumstance. The jury’s asked to – invited to accept that from a – to infer from a series of other circumstances that this vehicle was the vehicle with the numberplate, whatever it is, I can’t remember but A something or other, registered to Melissa Attard.

Counsel:   Yes, your Honour.

Her Honour:   So why is that so significant a circumstance if it needs to be proved beyond reasonable doubt?

Counsel:   Simply because it’s such a large part of the Crown case, I’d submit, your Honour, I raise for your consideration only.

Her Honour:   All right, I’ll think about it, yes.”


	
	Subsequently, during a break in the course of the summing up, the following further exchange took place (at SU43):
	


“Her Honour:   I’ve considered whether or not the ultimate inference is for the basic facts – not the ultimate inference – the intermediate ultimate inference is, if I can put it that way, drawn from the basic facts that (a) he had the phone in Manly at the time and (b) he was in, or driving Ms Attard’s car at the time in the place.

   I considered whether they were the sort of things that needed to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and it just doesn’t make sense for that to be the case because otherwise you would translate them into being essential links.

Counsel:   Essential elements, I understand.

Her Honour:   And that is simply not the case. I mean without them there’s not much left but nonetheless there’s something left.

Counsel:   I understand what your Honour says and accept all that but there is a difference between being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of something in my submission and the situation where there are a number of competing inference (sic) all reasonable drawing the one – there’s a difference between being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt and drawing an inference when it’s the only reasonable inference. So where there are competing inferences it’s not the same as being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt I would submit because where there are competing inferences, all reasonable, you can only draw the one against an accused if it’s the only reasonable inference. It’s different in my submission. Anyway, I raise it for your Honour’s consideration.

Her Honour:   Okay, I’ll think about it, probably.

Counsel:   I don’t wish to quibble but it may be important.

Her Honour:   I mean I’ll certainly think about it. What I was going to say I’ll think about it over the weekend, that was the part that was probable and not really necessary.

Counsel:   Think about it Monday morning.

Her Honour:   I would definitely think about it.

Counsel:   It may be important in the context of just this particular trial.”


	
	When the proceedings resumed on Monday 17 March 2014 there were exchanges recorded between counsel and the trial judge prior to the jury returning to court. The question of a direction of the kind initially raised by counsel for the applicant at trial was not revisited and no direction was given.
	


Submissions of the applicant


	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that the Crown case was a “links in the chain” case, such that the Crown’s allegation that the applicant was in the Jackaroo on 10 July 2009 was an intermediate fact which was an indispensable link in the jury’s chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt.
	
	
	It was submitted that properly considered, the case against the applicant was not simply one based on an accumulation of facts, but was one which involved taking a series of intermediate and critical steps in reasoning, leading to the conclusion that the applicant was in the Jackaroo at the relevant time. It was submitted that this was a critical and indispensable fact in a case where there were only a few circumstances which linked the applicant to the offending, and which warranted the trial judge giving the direction sought. It was submitted that the need for the trial judge to give such a direction was essential in those circumstances.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence concerning the Jackaroo did not constitute evidence of an indispensable intermediate fact requiring a direction of the kind which had been sought. It was submitted that although each piece of evidence was individually important in the Crown case, even if the evidence regarding the movement of the Jackaroo was removed, the Crown would have been able to prove its case, and that the absence of such evidence did not leave any “empty shell”.
	


Consideration


	
	In Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) [1984] HCA 7; (1984) 153 CLR 521 Gibbs CJ and Mason J (as his Honour then was) concluded (at 536) that a jury could not view a fact as a basis for an inference of guilt unless satisfied of that fact beyond reasonable doubt. In Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; (1990) 170 CLR 573, in referring to this passage, Mason CJ (at 575) acknowledged that his earlier judgment in Chamberlain No. 2 was capable of giving rise to some misconception. His Honour explained that his earlier reference to “a fact” being used as a basis for an inference of guilt should be read as a reference to “an intermediate fact as an indispensable basis for an inference of guilt”.
	
	
	Dawson J (with whom Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed) said in Shepherd (at 579):
	


“On the other hand, it may sometime be necessary or desirable to identify those intermediate facts which constitute indispensable links in a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt. Not every possible intermediate conclusion of fact will be of that character. If it is appropriate to identify an intermediate fact as indispensable it may well be appropriate to tell the jury that that fact must be found beyond reasonable doubt before the ultimate inference can be drawn. But where…the evidence consists of strands in a cable rather than links in a chain, it will not be appropriate to give such a warning.”


	
	Whether a direction of the kind referred to by their Honours is appropriate in a given case will necessarily depend on the circumstances. It is for a trial judge to determine whether it is necessary to give such a direction. In determining that question, the trial judge should consider whether the jury might reasonably regard certain facts to be indispensable intermediate facts, even if the judge does not: R v Merritt [1999] NSWCCA 29 at [70].
	
	
	One approach which has been identified as appropriate in determining whether or not a fact is indispensable is whether, if the fact is removed from the accumulation of facts, what is left is an “empty shell”: R v Zaiter [2004] NSWCCA 35 at [8] per Ipp JA, Sully and Adams JJ agreeing. Adopting this approach in the present case, the analysis of the evidence in respect of ground 1 demonstrates that even if the evidence of movements of a white 4WD was removed, what remained in the Crown case was not an empty shell. The remaining evidence included:
	



	
	the appellant’s presence at Manly at a time proximate to the offence, in circumstances where he lived a considerable distance away;
	
	
	the comparisons to be drawn from the appearances of the two persons in the CCTV footage in Peacock Street, and the two persons in the CCTV footage at Penrith Plaza (who were accepted to be the applicant and his brother);
	
	
	the attempted contact between the applicant and Gibson on the evening of 10 July;
	
	
	the collection of the applicant and his brother, by Gibson, several hours later; and
	
	
	their travel to Penrith Plaza in circumstances where the appellant or his brother gave Gibson a cheque, where that cheque had been stolen from Mrs Cooper the day before, and where the appellant and his brother left the Penrith Plaza after the cheque had been deposited (thus indicating that the applicant’s only reason for attending Penrith Plaza was related to the cashing of the cheque).
	



	
	I would reject ground 2.
	


GROUND 3 – THE TRIAL MISCARRIED AS A RESULT OF THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE’S ERROR IN NOT DISCHARGING THE JURY IN THE TRIAL OF THE APPLICANT UPON MARK HUMPHRIES CHANGING HIS PLEA TO GUILTY BEFORE THEM

The determination of the trial judge


	
	After the Crown had been granted leave to amend the indictment following the close of its case, the trial judge was informed (commencing at T360 L21) that the applicant’s brother proposed to plead guilty to count 1. The Crown agreed to accept that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment, with counts 2 and 3 being placed on a Form 1. Counsel for the applicant’s brother then raised the question of the appropriate procedure, and specifically raised the question of whether the plea should be entered before the jury (T360 L37 - 39). When her Honour asked the Crown Prosecutor to indicate his position, he responded (at T360 L48 - 49) by specifically submitting that any plea of guilty should be entered before the jury. The trial judge agreed and expressed the view (commencing at T361 L1) that this course was necessary because the applicant’s brother, having earlier pleaded not guilty, remained in the charge of the jury. Counsel for the applicant’s brother indicated (at T361 L16) that he was “happy” to proceed in that way.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant at trial immediately made application that the jury be discharged upon the plea being entered. Counsel submitted (commencing at T363 L10) that irrespective of any direction which might be given by the trial judge the jury would, in considering the applicant’s case, inevitably have regard to the fact of the plea of guilty in a prejudicial way. Counsel emphasised the fact that the Crown case was based upon a joint criminal enterprise (at T371 L32-33) and submitted that as a result there was a real danger that the jury would reason that the applicant was guilty “by close association” with his brother.
	
	
	The Crown opposed the application and submitted (commencing at T362 L14) that it would be appropriate for the trial judge to remind the jury that the two accused were being tried separately, and that the plea of guilty by the applicant’s brother was not a fact that could be relied upon as proof of the charge against the applicant.
	
	
	Her Honour rejected the application that the jury be discharged (T371 L32-33). Although formal reasons were not delivered, it is evident from the exchanges recorded in the transcript that the following matters were material to her Honour’s determination:
	



	
	the terms of the charge to which the applicant’s brother pleaded guilty did not, in any way, incriminate the applicant (T362 L26-27);
	
	
	there were distinctions in the evidence of identification (T362 L35-37);
	
	
	in light of the fact that the Crown case was one of joint criminal enterprise, the evidence of the offending by the applicant’s brother was admissible in the applicant’s trial in any event (T364 L20 - T366 L46);
	
	
	the jury would accept any directions given to them (T370 L47-48) and that although there were some circumstances in which unfair prejudice could not be addressed by way of a direction to the jury, the present case was not one of them (T371 L1 - T372 L5).
	



	
	In the course of exchanges with counsel, the trial judge made reference to s. 157 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (“the CPA”) which is in the following terms:
	


Change to guilty plea during trial


	
	If an accused person pleads “guilty” to an offence at any time after having been given into the charge of a jury, and the court accepts the plea, the court is to discharge the jury from giving a verdict in the matter and to find the accused person guilty of the offence.
	
	
	The finding has effect as if it were the verdict of the jury, and the accused person is liable to punishment accordingly.
	



	
	The reference in subs.(1) to the court being required to discharge the jury must be read as a reference to the court discharging the jury in respect of the particular count in the indictment to which the plea of guilty has been entered. It was not suggested that this provision supported the proposition that the jury should have been discharged in the present case.
	
	
	Ultimately, the applicant’s brother was re-arraigned before the jury and pleaded guilty to count 1 (T375 L31 to 39). The trial judge explained to the jury that this brought their role in respect of the trial of the applicant’s brother to an end (at T375 L41-49). In doing so, her Honour said:
	


“I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that the plea of guilty to that count before you as the jury under the law operates as a conviction for that offence for Mark Humphries”.


	
	Having explained to the jury the nature of a Form 1 (on which the Crown had agreed to include counts 2 and 3) her Honour said to the jury (at T376 L21-23):
	


“So I formally discharge you from reaching a verdict or making a determination so far as Mark Humphries is concerned in relation to counts 2 and 3”.


	
	Her Honour then told the jury (commencing at T376 L25) that the applicant’s brother would “now disappear from this trial” but that the trial would proceed against the applicant. Her Honour then directed the jury in the following terms (commencing at T377 L8):
	


“… the fact that Mark Humphries has pleaded guilty to this offence is not evidence available for you to take into account in any way at all in deciding the guilt or otherwise of (the appellant). The Crown does not rely on it in that way, it is not evidence that you are entitled to take into account in that way. It is simply what has happened and it is not a relevant factor for you to take into account in any way, particularly not in a way that is adverse to (the appellant). It means nothing other than Mark Humphries has pleaded guilty and ultimately will be sentenced by me for that which he has pleaded guilty to.”


	
	No further direction was sought or given.
	


Submissions of the applicant


	
	Counsel for the applicant accepted that in a trial of more than one accused, a change of plea from not guilty to guilty by one of the accused will not of itself require the jury to be discharged. Counsel also accepted that whether such course should be taken must be determined according to whether the remaining accused can still have a fair trial.
	
	
	However, counsel submitted that as a consequence of the plea of guilty entered by the applicant’s brother, the applicant suffered unfair prejudice arising from the likelihood that the jury had taken into account that plea in determining the case against the applicant. Whilst counsel acknowledged the terms of the direction given by the trial judge, he submitted that in all of the circumstances no direction was capable of overcoming the prejudice which had arisen. It was submitted that had the plea been taken in the absence of the jury, the trial judge could have given careful directions about the sudden absence of the applicant’s brother, including a direction that the jury was not to speculate as to the reasons for that absence.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the case against the applicant’s brother was so overwhelming that his decision to plead guilty should be seen as little more than recognition of the fact that the jury would inevitably have reached that finding. It was submitted that the direction given by the trial judge had ensured that there was no risk that the jury would use the plea of guilty entered by the applicant’s brother in manner which was unfairly prejudicial to the applicant. In this regard the Crown emphasised the necessity to accept the fundamental proposition that a jury will act in accordance with the directions given by a trial judge.
	


Consideration


	
	The fact that a jury may become aware of a plea of guilty entered by a co-accused was recognised by Lord Goddard in R v Moore (1956) 40 Cr App R 50 at 53-54:
	


“When two people are indicted together for a criminal offence and one pleads Guilty and the other does not, it is the commonest thing in the world to tell the jury, as was done in this case, “You must not pay any attention to the fact that the other man has pleaded Guilty”. Even if the plea has not been taken in the presence of the jury, it is very difficult to avoid telling the jury in some way that the other person has pleaded Guilty but the fact that he has pleaded guilty is no evidence against his co-prisoner.”


	
	In R v Cowell (1987) 24 A Crim R 47 the Crown Prosecutor had told a jury in an opening address that the accused’s co-offender had pleaded guilty. No objection was taken at that time but after the close of the defence case, the accused made application to the trial judge to discharge the jury on the basis that the Crown had not called evidence of the co-accused having been charged and having pleaded guilty. The application was refused by the trial judge and on appeal it was argued that the statement in the Crown’s opening had unfairly prejudiced the applicant.
	
	
	Street CJ (with whom Lee and Wood JJ agreed) observed (at 50) that the course taken by the Crown in the opening address would only have been permissible had it been necessary for the purposes of the trial, and that no justification for it could be identified. Whilst the facts in Cowell are obviously different from those in the present case Street CJ, in reference to the passage of the judgment of Lord Goddard in Moore in [100] above said (at p.50):
	


“The principle there enunciated is, notwithstanding a suggestion to the contrary, one which has always been recognised in the criminal courts of this State. When, in the course of a trial, one of a number of co-accused pleads guilty, that fact is, of course, inevitably known to the jury who must be invited (but not directed) to return a verdict in consequence of that plea. At the same time, trial judges are astute to ensure that juries are made plainly aware that a plea of guilty by a co-accused is not to be taken into account in the slightest degree in determining the question of guilt of those who remain in charge of the jury.”


	
	The procedure of inviting a jury to return a verdict to which the Chief Justice referred rendered it inevitable that the jury would become aware of the fact of the plea. However s. 157 of the CPA now governs the procedure which is to be adopted. That provision proceeds on the basis that if the court accepts the plea, it is to discharge the jury in respect of the relevant count(s). In any event, it is evident that the Chief Justice attached paramount importance to the necessity for the trial judge to direct the jury that a plea of guilty by one accused plays no part in the determination of whether the case against any co-accused is established. That necessity was re-iterated in Romeo & Ors v R (1987) 25 A Crim R 80 (per Burt CJ at 82 and per Brinsden J at 85).
	
	
	A slightly different situation arose in R v Coates and Murphy [2002] NSWCCA 481; (2002) 136 A Crim R 252 where the applicants were arraigned along with two co-offenders (W and K) on a charge of conspiracy to manufacture a prohibited drug. All four accused pleaded not guilty. At the close of the Crown case, the trial judge was informed by counsel for W that he proposed to change his plea to guilty. That plea was taken in the absence of the jury. The Crown then applied to amend the indictment to the extent necessary to accommodate the change in plea. The remaining co-accused sought a discharge of the jury which was rejected by the trial judge. They were convicted and on appeal argued that in light of the fact that the charge was one of conspiracy, a co-accused “disappearing” from the dock caused them considerable prejudice which was incapable of being remedied by any warning of the trial judge.
	
	
	In dismissing the appeal Carruthers AJ (with whom Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) and Sperling J agreed) again emphasised the importance of careful directions being given to the jury by the trial judge (commencing at [86]):
	


“His Honour gave the jury very careful directions directed to ensuring that the remaining accused suffered no prejudice as a result of (Mr W’s) departure from the courtroom. His Honour stressed the fact that they must not speculate about the reason for his absence and stressed the important nature of that direction”.


	
	In R v Golding & Edwards [2008] SASC 68; (2008) 100 SASR 216 the applicants were jointly charged with two co-offenders, CM and SM. Early in the trial, following the commencement of the prosecution evidence, CM and SM each pleaded guilty to the counts alleged against them. Following the pleas, the jury returned verdicts of guilty with respect to both of them. An application for a discharge of the jury was rejected by the trial judge. The remaining accused were convicted and appealed.
	
	
	Gray J (with whom Doyle CJ and David J agreed) observed (at [20]) that a plea by an alleged co-offender during a trial occurs from time to time and that the principles to be applied were well settled. His Honour noted that the terms of the direction given by the trial judge included a direction that the pleas of guilty could not be relied upon by the prosecution in its case against either applicant. His Honour further noted (at [22]) that at the commencement of his final address, the prosecutor reminded the jury of the trial judge’s earlier direction and of its terms and effect and that in the course of the summing up the trial judge, on several occasions, referred to the fact the pleas could not be relied upon by the prosecution. His Honour concluded (at [24]):
	


“The Judge gave the jury an appropriate direction. The prosecutor drew the attention of the jury in his final address to the Judge’s earlier direction. The jury were reminded by the Judge in the course of the summing up of the substantive effect of the earlier direction on three separate occasions. There was no risk that a miscarriage could have arisen from the suggested need to repeat the entire direction during the summing up.”


	
	Apart from cases in which a co-offender has changed his plea in the course of the trial, there have also been cases in which juries have become aware of an earlier plea of guilty by a co-accused as a result of that co-accused giving evidence. In those cases, the necessity of the trial judge to give appropriate directions to the jury has similarly been emphasised.
	
	
	In R v Fountain; R v Tootell [2001] VSCA 200; (2001) 124 A Crim R 100, the applicants stood trial in respect of a number of counts in relation to which two co-offenders had previously pleaded guilty. Both co-offenders gave evidence at the applicant’s trial, in the course of which evidence was led that each of them had pleaded guilty to the various offences upon which the applicants were being tried. In his closing address, the Crown told the jury that the fact that the co-offender had pleaded guilty could not be used against the applicants. The same point was made by defence counsel in his address but no further direction was given by the trial judge in his summing up to the jury. No exception was taken by trial counsel to the absence of such a direction.
	
	
	In upholding the appeal Charles JA (with whom Buchanan and Chernov JJA agreed) said (at [30]):
	


“There was, I think, plainly a possibility that the jury would make improper use of the evidence that (the co-offenders) had pleaded guilty to the same offences. The prosecutor's submission to the jury certainly did not make it clear that the pleas of guilty by (the co-offenders) could only be used to rebut any contention by the defence that pressure had been placed by the investigating police officers upon these witnesses to make a statement in support of the prosecution case or to undermine the concessions made by the witnesses under cross-examination in favour of the case of self-defence made by the applicants. On the contrary it seems to me that the prosecutor's words invited the jury to treat the pleas of guilty as evidence tending to establish the guilt of the applicants. On this basis the evidence clearly had the potential to be prejudicial to the applicants who were being alleged to be co-offenders of the persons who had pleaded guilty. In these circumstances the judge should have warned the jury appropriately, as stated in Cowell and Burnett.”


	
	In R v Burnett (1994) 76 A Crim R 148 (to which Charles JA referred) the Court (Nicholson, Owen and White JJ) had said (at 152):
	


“It is certainly the case that where evidence of a plea of guilty of a co-offender is admitted the jury must be very specifically informed of the limited use that they are entitled of that piece of information.”


	
	Similar observations to those made in Fountain have since been made in other cases: Andelman v R [2013] VSCA 25; (2013) 38 VR 659 at [47] per the Court (Maxwell P, Weinberg and Priest JJA); Dunn v R [2015] WASCA 126 at [256] per Buss JA (Newnes and Mazza JJA agreeing).
	
	
	It will be apparent from these authorities that the circumstances in which a jury may become aware of the plea of guilty by a co-offender can vary. The ultimate question is whether or not such circumstances have caused a miscarriage of justice. Central to the question of whether such a miscarriage has been caused will be the nature of any direction given by the trial judge. The trial judge is under an obligation to direct the jury that the plea of guilty entered by one co-accused is not to be taken into account, in any way, in determining whether the Crown has proved its case against any remaining co-accused.
	
	
	Contrary to the position as it apparently existed at the time of the decision in Moore, and as a consequence of the operation of s. 157 of the Criminal Procedure Act, there was in my view no requirement in the present case to invite the jury to return a verdict of guilty against the applicant’s brother. In those circumstances, the preferable course would have been to have the plea entered by the appellant’s brother in the absence of the jury, to then discharge the jury with respect to all counts against him in accordance with s. 157, and to direct the jury (inter alia) that they were not to speculate as to the reasons why the appellant’s brother would play no further part in the trial. Such a course was adopted by the trial judge in Coates and Murphy and this Court found the directions given by the trial judge entirely appropriate.
	
	
	However notwithstanding that the plea was entered before the jury in the present case, I am firmly of the view that no miscarriage of justice occurred as a result. Bearing in mind the primacy which appellate Courts have attached to the terms of any direction given by the trial judge in these circumstances, the trial judge in the present case gave a comprehensive direction to the jury in which it was made clear that the plea of guilty entered by the applicant’s brother:
	



	
	was not available to be taken into account, in any way, in determining whether the Crown had proved its case against the applicant;
	
	
	was not relied upon by the Crown; and
	
	
	meant nothing, other than the fact that the applicant’s brother had pleaded guilty to the offence and would ultimately be sentenced in respect of it.
	



	
	In my view, the jury could not possibly have been under any misapprehension about the fact that the plea entered by the applicant’s brother was irrelevant to their determination of the case against the applicant. Moreover, it is to be expected that the jury followed the direction which was given: R v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; (1992) 173 CLR 592 per Mason CJ and Toohey J, cited by Barr J (Spigelman CJ and Price J agreeing) in Lodhi v R [2007] NSWCCA 360; (2007) 179 A Crim R 470 at [153].
	
	
	I would only add that in the present case, counsel for the appellant did not ask for the direction given by the trial judge to be repeated. For my part, in circumstances where a co-accused does change his or her plea in the course of a trial leaving one or more co-accused remaining, it would be prudent for the necessary direction to be given not only when the plea is entered, but also in the summing up.
	
	
	For all of these reasons I would reject ground 3.
	


Orders


	
	For the reasons I have expressed, I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	RS HULME AJ: I agree with Bellew J.

	ADAMS J:
	


Introduction


	
	The applicant, with an extensive criminal record involving convictions for sexual offences committed against children, was, on 22 July 2009, subjected to an extended supervision order pursuant to the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (now the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW)) for five years from 18 May 2009. That order required the applicant to comply with a number of conditions, any breach of which would be an offence under s 12 of the latter Act. He was charged with three breaches of the supervision order, one of which was constituted by the commission of three substantive offences involving the possession of child abuse material, contrary to s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The other two breaches were, respectively, of conditions of the supervision order (a) that he comply with directions of his Community Corrections supervisor (relevantly, to provide internet user details) and (b) that he not make contact with children under 16 without an approved adult being present. He was brought before the District Court on the three s 91H(2) charges and for the three offences of breaching his supervision order, at the one time. He pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to an aggregate term of 8 years and 3 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and 3 months. He seeks leave to appeal against his sentence.
	


Offences


	
	In respect of the three offences under s 91H(2), they comprised images found on a DVD, a flash drive and a laptop, those in each medium being the subject of a charge. The indicative sentence in respect of each of the DVD and the flash drive material was 4 years imprisonment and, in respect of the laptop material, 2 years imprisonment. For the breaches of the extended supervision order, the indicative sentences were, for the commission of a criminal offence (namely those contrary to s 91H(2)), 12 months imprisonment, failing to provide internet details, 9 months imprisonment and contacting children under 16, 18 months’ imprisonment. So far as the first of the breach offences is concerned, the primary judge indicated that, had individual sentences been imposed, the sentence would have been concurrent with one of the s 91H(2) offences. Otherwise, the extent of accumulation was moderated by considerations of totality. Each of the indicative sentences had been reduced by 25 per cent, reflecting the utilitarian discount for early pleas. It should be accepted that this discount carried through to the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	The applicant relies upon the following grounds –
	


(i) The learned sentencing judge erred by taking into account inaccurate, extraneous and out of date material from the reports tendered by the Crown;

(ii) The learned sentencing judge erred by double-counting the aggravating feature of 'breach of conditional liberty' for the offences of breach extended supervision order;

(iii) The sentencing judge erred by finding that the objective seriousness of the three offences of possess child abuse material (s91H(2)) offences was “very high”;

(iv) The aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive and failed to take into account totality;

(v) The effective aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive in relation to the three section 91H(2) offences and failed to take into account the principle of totality.

Facts


	
	Together with a statement of agreed facts setting out the circumstances of the offences, the Crown tendered a quantity of psychological and psychiatric material which was used for the purpose of the application to the Supreme Court for the extended supervision order which the applicant admittedly breached. This material was tendered by consent and no particular part of it was placed in issue, or, indeed, was, with one exception, the subject of specific submission. The exception, which it is necessary to consider in some detail, related to the recommendation in a number of reports concerning anti-libidinal medication.
	
	
	The circumstances of the offence and the learned primary judge’s findings about them were not controversial in the appeal. It is convenient first to deal with the possession of child abuse material. The following is taken from the primary judge’s reasons. On the laptop hard drive there was one video file described in the agreed statement of facts as, “Male approximately 12 years old, undressing in bathroom, background music playing, not under duress, all clothes removed, then masturbates”. On the Child Exploitation Tracking System (CETS) scale, it fell into category two (non-penetrative sexual activity between children or solo masturbation by a child). In addition to this video file there were 70 picture files, 49 of which fell into CETS scale category one (depicting children, no sexual activity, involving nudity, sexually suggestive poses, explicit emphasis on genital areas and solo urination), 14 files in category two, three files in category three (non-penetrative sexual activity between a child or children and adults) and four files in category four (penetrative sexual activity involving children or both children and adults including but not limited to, intercourse, cunnilingus and fellatio). So far as the DVD is concerned, it contained 11 video files, all falling into category four on the CETS scale. Some of the children are tied by their feet and hands. Overall, many male children are involved, aged between five and 14 years. The flash drive contained 583 picture files, of which 445 fell into CETS scale category one, one file into category two, 32 files into category three, 84 files into category four and 21 into category five (sadism or bestiality, that is, sexual imagery involving pain, humiliation or animals). In total, the applicant possessed one video depicting child abuse at CETS scale category two, 11 videos at CETS scale category four, 494 pictures depicting child abuse at CETS scale category one, 15 pictures depicting child abuse at CETS scale category two, 35 pictures depicting child abuse at CETS scale category three, 88 pictures depicting child abuse at CETS scale category four and 21 animations and cartoons depicting child abuse at CETS scale category six (animation or cartoons depicting sex scale images of one to five), in this case all were in CETS scale category five.
	
	
	The primary judge viewed all the images for herself and noted that a number of them depicted penetrative sexual activity involving young children appearing to be between the ages of 6 and 12, a number depicted a child or children bound with their hands tied behind their back, others portrayed gratuitous cruelty and humiliation, such as children being urinated on and being forced to swallow ejaculate and urine, whilst one particular image, which was a close up, showed the face of a child appearing to be about six years old who appeared profoundly distressed.
	
	
	The applicant was in almost daily contact with his son, Michael, then aged 41 years, who was also a registered child sex offender. There were numerous text messages between them recorded on the applicant’s mobile telephone. They mentioned a number of names of children either to communicate with on the internet or to meet. It is unnecessary for present purposes to set out those communications but I mention the following to demonstrate the context for the offences. The applicant believed that two of the boys were in the United Kingdom and he and his son were discussing ways by which at least one (“Z”) might come to Australia. The applicant told police that he was “18 or something, 17, 18, 16, 17”, but a screenshot on the applicant’s laptop of a MSN chat with this boy showed his profile photograph of the head of a boy approximately 10 years of age with his mouth open, together with an image of the applicant sitting in front of the computer, as captured on his webcam, while he was chatting with the child. The applicant said that it was his son who had the real interest, “a close affinity”. Other parts of their exchanged texts also suggested that Z was a young child. The applicant was able to identify a number of children on the flash drive, with whom he had also chatted on the internet. He was told that one was five, another seven, Z “was about nine or something” and a fourth was, six, seven or eight years old. He had seen photographs of these children.
	
	
	Generally, the applicant asserted to police that he “rarely” accessed the images on his computer and only accessed images of three children on the flash drive. To police he denied knowing anything about the DVD but, as he lived alone and no one else had access, he said, to anything in his house, this denial was plainly untrue; at all events he pleaded guilty to possessing the images that were discovered on it. Although it appears that the children in whom the applicant had an interest were living in the United Kingdom, it seems they were connected with a network with links to the Ukraine, possibly an orphanage. Overall the children were part of what the applicant described as a program “run by monks”. Amongst other SMS conversations between the applicant and his son is the following –
	



	
		
			
			“Michael:
			
			
			‘I have found one for the 16 yo’
			
		
		
			
			Offender:
			
			
			‘Okay, where abouts?’

	As the primary judge noted, the applicant claimed to the police that he and his son became aware that children were being abused by a group of monks in a monastery in the Ukraine and claimed they were simply trying to get as much information about the group as they could, so that they could take it to the authorities in an effort to assist these boys and prevent their abuse. The applicant had participated in what appears to have been forms of sexual role play so that he could, he claimed, in effect procure the trust of the so called priests and monks to find out more for the authorities. He said that he had not in fact alerted the authorities because the people in the Ukraine “knew every single thing about me” and suspected they might have connections to the judicial system in Australia. The applicant’s attempts to give an innocent explanation for his actions were brazenly dishonest and, with respect, it is scarcely surprising that the primary judge characterised his account to police as a “series of lies designed to conceal the fact that [the applicant’s] communication with and about these boys was motivated by a sexual interest in them.” He agreed that the diary entries were his but denied that he was attracted to young boys, although he said he used to be. Her Honour noted that essentially his claim was that this attraction had ceased because he had completed the CUBIT program at Long Bay Gaol. Her Honour concluded that the seized material demonstrated beyond doubt that he was motivated by his continued sexual interest in children, notwithstanding completion of this program.
	
	
	Dealing with possible aggravating factors, the primary judge concluded that, although the applicant communicated with his son, also a registered sex offender, during the period the offences were committed and that they discussed the images, some of the boys that had been depicted and they were both communicating with a number of young boys through internet chat, the evidence did not establish that the applicant was part of a collaborative network in the sense, as I understand her Honour, a planned or organised criminal activity vide s 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). In short, her Honour concluded that there was no planning or organisation that went beyond that which was inherent in the offences. Nor did her Honour accept the contention of the Crown that the boys under 16 whom he contacted (by internet) without an approved adult present (giving rise to one of the charges of breach of the extended supervision order) were either physically or intellectually disabled, or that the applicant believed them to be so. Her Honour noted that the applicant was not responsible for posting the images that were the subject of the s 91H(2) charges and did not profit from the offences.
	


Prior offences


	
	The applicant’s prior offences were detailed by the primary judge as follows –
	


“The offender first came before the Court in 1962 for two counts of indecent assault upon a male. In 1963, he was convicted of wilful and obscene exposure. In 1968, he was dealt with in Brisbane District Court on two charges of committing an act of gross indecency with a male person. He received a sentence on that occasion of imprisonment of eighteen months. In 1973, at Orange District Court, he was convicted of an indecent assault on a male person and sentenced to two years' imprisonment.

In 1977, at Sydney District Court, he was dealt with on charges of indecent assault on a male person. He received a sentence of imprisonment of three years six months and two years six months to be served cumulatively. In 1984, at Newcastle District Court, he was sentenced to a term of four years' imprisonment for an offence of indecent assault upon a male. In 1993, at Queanbeyan District Court, he was convicted of one count of indecent assault, for which he was placed on a three year good behaviour bond.

In 1997, at Sydney District Court, he was dealt with for offences of aggravated indecent assault and incite act of indecency. He was dealt with by of term of imprisonment of four years with a minimum term of two years.

Finally, in 2004, he was convicted of a number of counts of sexual intercourse with a person under 16, namely two boys aged 12. He was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of five years six months with a non-parole period of four years six months.”


	
	At the conclusion of this sentence the applicant was released subject to an interim supervision order and, ultimately, an extended supervision order for a period of five years to commence from 18 May 2009, subject to the conditions (amongst others) to which I have already referred: see State of New South Wales v O’Sullivan [2009] NSWSC 704. Price J noted a number of breaches of parole and a good behaviour bond during the course of his history and summarised it as revealing “a longstanding pattern of sexual offending against prepubescent boys.”
	


Subjective features


	
	The applicant was almost 67 years of age at the time of the offences and will shortly turn 70. He was born in Queensland where his father ran a cattle property. At the age of 26 he married a woman he met in a psychiatric hospital. This marriage, although it produced two children, lasted only three years. The applicant has not had a significant relationship since. The applicant has been regular contact with his son by way of telephone and his daughter, who resides in Queensland and has confirmed to the community corrections officer that she contacted her father at least two or three times a week. Although physical contact with his son was prohibited, he has maintained regular telephone contact with him. It appears that the applicant’s relationship with his father was supportive but he has been estranged from his mother with no contact for some 40 years. He has limited support in the community. He left school at the age of 15 and has been employed mainly as a labourer. In the mid-1960s, following a period of incarceration for his first sexual offence, the applicant was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for a period of two years but he is not currently seeking any medical assistance in relation to any mental health issues. There was no evidence suggesting a major psychiatric disorder in the form of any affective anxiety disorder or psychotic illness. He appeared to function in the normal IQ range.
	
	
	I have mentioned that the applicant completed the CUBIT program whilst in prison. Whilst under supervision he was subject to a community maintenance program through the forensic psychology services. He was assessed as being in the high risk category of offenders. It is fair to note that the applicant had demonstrated what was thought to be positive progress whilst on the CUBIT program, although this has plainly only had limited, if any, practical effect.
	
	
	A pre-sentence report was tendered on sentence. The Community Corrections Officer reported that the applicant maintained that the offences were committed “to prevent children from being harmed” and that his actions were “totally bloody stupid”. This simply repeats the dishonest excuse given to the police when he was interviewed. The acknowledgement of stupidity may be candid and accurate but it demonstrates no understanding of the wrongness of his conduct nor, as the primary judge (rightly) found, any remorse. The fact is, as her Honour noted, the extensive documentation dealing, amongst other things, with the applicant’s communications with Corrective Services, psychologists and psychiatrists for the purpose of the extended supervision proceedings, does not suggest he offered any contrition for his conduct (for all, as I surmise, he may have done during the CUBIT process).
	


Recommendations as to anti-libidinal medication


	
	The written submissions of the Crown prosecutor on sentence noted the following –
	


“The offender completed a CUBIT program between 7 April 2008 and 25 February 2009. The Forensic Psychologist at the time stated that post-completion of the CUBIT program, the offender has higher self-esteem – but note that this was based on the offender’s self-report. Despite this, at the completion of the CUBIT program, a psychological report dated 6 March 2009 which undertook actuarial analysis indicated the offender was a high risk of re-offending. The offender was offered the opportunity to take anti-libidinal drugs but declined, because he felt he didn’t need that pharmacotherapy [page 3 of the Progress Report to the Attorney General re. extension of supervision order].”


	
	In oral submissions at the hearing, the prosecutor said, referring to the applicant’s prior record, that he had been given ample opportunity to rehabilitate and submitted he “has refused anti-libidinal pharmacotherapy”. The judge dealt briefly with this issue –
	


“As I understand it, the offender has, to date, refused to take such medication. When asked about why he refused to take the medication, the offender told Dr Samuels [in April 2009] that he had not actually refused it, but had heard bad things about it in gaol. He also claimed that he was about to begin a heterosexual relationship and he had concerns that such medication may affect his sexual functioning.”

Her Honour then dealt with the risk factors noted in the reports, his actuarial risks score, his intellectual functioning and then referred to a report of a forensic psychologist, Anna Hoy, of March 2009 –

“Ms Hoy reported that the offender demonstrated progress whilst on the CUBIT program.

According to Ms Hoy, he appeared to have developed insight into his offending behaviour… [and] strongly recommended that he consider anti libidinal medication to assist him in exerting appropriate self control. As noted above, it appears that the offender has not taken up this recommendation.”


	
	Her Honour referred to this matter as mentioned in the report of a Dr Hearps of 7 July 2008, where it was noted that the applicant had “demonstrated a pattern of sexual behaviour with pre-pubescent boys over a period of four decades… [and] fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for paedophilia. Dr Herps recommended treatment with libido lowering medication.” Her Honour summarised the position as follows –
	


“In the reports before me, the offender is assessed as a high risk offender. A recurrent recommendation of those professionals who dealt with him was that he consider anti libidinal medication.”


	
	Although at first I was inclined to the view that her Honour’s reference to this subject matter was a mere account of part of the relevant chronology, in light of the way that this matter was put to her by the Crown, as indicating that the applicant has no genuine intention to rehabilitate himself, it seems to me, with respect, that her Honour did view the fact that he had not accepted the recommendations adversely as going to contrition and rehabilitation.
	
	
	However, this matter cannot be dealt with quite so simply. The progress report relating to his period under supervision dated 13 June 2011 states –
	


“PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS

Upon his initial release into the community in 2009, Mr O'Sullivan was placed on the antidepressant Sertraline, which additionally has a side effect lowering the libido. Mr O'Sullivan currently continues to take this medication, however his psychiatrist, Dr Andrew Ellis informed this Service that he had provided Mr O'Sullivan with the request for a blood analysis some time ago to be assessed for Androcur, an anti-libidinal medication, however was yet to receive an outcome. On 30 May 2011, Dr Ellis provided the offender with another request for blood tests, and the offender was directed by this Service to have those completed. The offender stated to the undersigned that he does not want to take anti-libidinal, nor does he feel that he needs them. However, Dr Ellis later advised this Service that he received the results from the previous blood tests and is in the process of determining Mr O’Sullivan's suitability for anti-libidinal medication.” [Emphasis added.]


	
	Dr Samuels in his report of 11 May 2009 stated –
	


“[5] Your opinion as to the suitability of Mr O'Sullivan for anti-libidinal medication including any Issues relating to the prescription and administration of anti-libidinal medication and the potential limitations of such medication

As far as I can ascertain there are no clear contraindications to Mr O'Sullivan being on anti-libidinal medication. As I have already noted, he will need to have a full workup for such medication and to be trialled on medication. He has indicated a willingness to take such medication as long as it does not interfere in his sexual functioning with Elaine. It often is a fine balance to ensure that normal sexual functioning is retained and deviant thinking and arousal eliminated and the dose of such medication may need to be carefully titrated. Obviously if the medication is causing major side effects, particularly if it is eliminating his sexual function, this would be a factor that could lead him to become non compliant.

[6] The likely time period required in order to trial and stabilise an offender on anti-libidinal medication

It can take some weeks to finalise all the investigations and once the prescriber is sure there are no medical contraindications, within a period of 4-12 weeks one should have a good idea of the appropriate dose and the effects of the medication on deviant arousal as well as any significant side effects mat are evident.”


	
	In the CUBIT program report of 6 March 2009 the following appears –
	


“With regard to more appropriate sexual arousal, Mr O'Sullivan discussed being aroused to sexual thoughts and fantasies about his current partner but that sex was not a priority in this relationship. Despite recommendations to use medication to assist with his sexual self regulation (please see reports written by Dr J. Carne, 3 September 1997 and Dr M. Hearps, 7 July 2008), Mr O'Sullivan is currently opposed to this due to concern it would limit future sexual relationships. When discussed in group he did, however, identify that appropriate self control may become more difficult when not in gaol and that medication may be useful in such a situation.

…

Given the extensive nature of Mr O'SulIivan's sexual disregulation in the past, it is recommended that he strongly consider the use of medication to assist him in exerting appropriate self control and to provide him from relief from any intrusive or concerning sexual interests. In such circumstances, Mr O'Sullivan is encouraged to work with the Community Forensic Mental Health Service: Sexual Behaviours Clinic.”


	
	In the psychological risk assessment from the Community Compliance Group dated January 2009 a reference was made to Dr Hearps’ recommendation –
	


“[23] In the same report, Dr. Hearps made the following recommendations:

‘Mr. O'Sullivan may benefit from treatment with libido-lowering medication, such as an anti-androgen or other hormonal treatment, or an SSRI. Mr O'Sullivan should be physically examined, and a blood work-up performed (including hormone assays), and we have referred him to our GP. Mr. O'Sullivan is currently unwilling to be treated with medication to reduce sex drive, and stated he prefers to rely on the support of his partner and family, to refrain from re-offending. However, he did admit the possibility that medication may be useful, should those supports prove inadequate. (P. 6).’”


	
	Price J, when imposing the extended supervision order, said (supra at [39]) –
	


“There are two reports from Dr Andrew Ellis. The defendant has given informed consent to ‘SSRI’ medication and is taking Zoloft. The likely side effects of that medication is a reduction in unconventional sexual fantasies, urges and masturbation.”

It is perhaps unfortunate that the primary judge was not provided with these reports. However, the judgment of Price J was part of the material produced by the Crown on the sentence proceedings and this passage (as well as the other material dealing with the question) should have been brought to her Honour’s attention by the prosecutor.


	
	Mr Johnston of counsel for the applicant on the appeal pointed out that one of the conditions to which the applicant was subjected was the following –
	


“28 … [The] defendant must accept sex drive reduction, medical treatment or any other therapy, including anti-libidinal treatment, if prescribed by a medical practitioner, as may be provided by CFMHS, Justice Health, and AMHS or any medical practitioner, and must not unreasonably refuse his consent in administering such prescribed drug or therapy.”

Whatever may have been the position prior to the applicant’s release from incarceration (and it is far from clear that any anti-libidinal medication was actually offered at a time when the appropriate tests had been taken so that its medical effects, including side effects, could be assessed and hence whether it was appropriate to be prescribed), at the time of the supervision order he would have been obliged to take the medication had the condition been invoked. There is no evidence that it was invoked, let alone that the applicant had indicated a refusal to comply with this condition.


	
	Accordingly, with respect, it seems to me that it was not appropriate to place the fact that the applicant had not taken anti-libidinal medication (although he had taken an SSRI) on the scales adverse to him in relation either to his attitude to offending or the risk of future offending.
	
	
	A related point, a propos the first ground of appeal is the following passage from the primary judge’s reasons, which immediately follows the last paragraph set out above relating to the recommendations about anti-libidinal medication –
	


“In my view, what is singularly missing in the reports is any expression of true remorse, contrition or even acknowledgement of the profound harm caused to children in the trade of supplying child abuse material for the purveyors of such images.”


	
	Mr Johnston submitted that, since the reports to which her Honour referred related to offences prior to the present offences which did not involve either the making or supplying of child abuse material, this absence could not indicate his present attitude to the present offences. At first impression, this appears to be a valid point. However, it is necessary to look at the context for the observation, which was followed immediately by this passage –
	


“In the most recent report of Community Corrections dated 16 March 2014, the offender, when asked about his attitude to the offending conduct, stated that his actions were ‘totally bloody stupid’. There is no evidence before me to establish that he is remorseful for his offending conduct. Indeed, I find that the offender, whilst perhaps gaining a superficial insight into his offending conduct through his participation in the CUBIT program, continues to lack any genuine and deep understanding of the impact of the offending conduct on the children.

The evidence establishes, in my view, a real likelihood that this offender will reoffend in the future. There is nothing before me that could give the Court any confidence that the offender has any prospects of rehabilitation.”

In my view, the passage to which Mr Johnston refers is, although perhaps awkwardly phrased, intended as a general statement about the applicant’s lack of remorse for any sexually related criminal conduct, and his present position is a continuation of that of the past. This was an entirely justifiable conclusion, as well as an important one.

Double counting


	
	Following reference to Sivell v R [2009] NSWCCA 286 where the appellant, whose offences were breaches of prohibition orders made pursuant to the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004 (NSW) was regarded as being in the same position as if he had breached a bond, suspended sentence or parole, for the purposes of s 21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the primary judge stated –
	


“I accept, therefore, that by virtue of the fact that the offender was on an extended supervision order at the time he committed these offences, he was on conditional liberty, thereby constituting an aggravating feature.”


	
	Mr Johnston submits that it was not appropriate to take into account, in respect of the offences alleging breaches of the supervision order, that he was on conditional liberty at the time, since it is an inherent characteristic of such an offence that an offender is on conditional liberty. If her Honour had indeed taken this matter into consideration in respect of the breaches of the order, Mr Johnston’s point is well taken. However, it seems to me that a fair reading of her Honour’s reasons demonstrate that the phrase “these offences” was a reference to the sex abuse material offences and not to the breaches of the order. Her Honour introduced the subject matter, after a reference to the likelihood that the applicant might commit further serious offences if he were not kept under supervision, then stated –
	


“The offender once again comes before the Court having committed serious criminal offences whilst on that extended supervision order. The Crown submits that an aggravating factor is that the offender was on conditional liberty; that is, the extended supervision order, at the time of the commission of these offences.

It was conceded on behalf of the offender that he was on conditional liberty by virtue of being on the extended supervision order.”


	
	Her Honour then referred to Sivell and, having noted the matter already quoted, went on to assess “the objective seriousness of the offences” describing the material which was found in the applicant’s possession, referring to the particular issues relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of those offences. It was at the conclusion of this discussion that her Honour went on to discuss the 91H(2) offences, stating –
	


“I find… that the 91H(2) offences are objectively very serious and that the moral culpability of the offender is extremely high. I also find that the breaches of the extended supervision order are a serious example of wilful disregard for the Court based orders. Disturbingly, the breach constituted by the offender communicating with children under 16 demonstrates the offender's continued sexual interest in young boys and his preparedness to act upon that sexual interest by sourcing children or having children sourced for him.”

It follows that I would reject this ground of appeal.

Ground 3


	
	This ground of appeal concerns the characterisation of the objective seriousness of the possession by the applicant of the child abuse material as “very high”. It is clear that the distinction between each offence was based upon the medium on which it had been recorded and did not reflect any differentiation that depended upon the nature of the material to which each charge referred. However, it is the case that, in respect of the material on the laptop, there was only one video file which was CETS scale two whilst 49 of the picture files were at scale one, 14 at scale two, 134 at scale three and four at scale four. On the other hand, on the DVD there were 11 video files all at CETS scale four, whilst of the 583 picture files on the flash drive, although by far the majority (445) were at scale one, 84 were at scale four and 21 at scale five. Accordingly, accepting that the only mode of differentiating between each charge was the content on each medium, that on the laptop was rather less serious than that on the other two media, whilst the content of the flash drive, by virtue principally of the 21 picture files at CETS scale five, is the most serious.
	
	
	It was submitted by Mr Johnston that the objective seriousness of the material located on the laptop was not “very high” because of the limited number of the images and their relatively low classification, pointing out that the primary judge implicitly accepted this assessment by indicating an indicative sentence of 2 years for this offence. It is also submitted that the objective seriousness of the material on the DVD was not “very high” because, although the material on the videos were classified at CETS scale four there were only 11 of them. So far as the USB flash drive is concerned, Mr Johnston points out that, although the primary judge referred to the 21 images at CETS scale five as being “animations and cartoons” her Honour later observed that “a small number of images depicting child abuse material were categorised as CETS five” not making reference at this point to the fact that these images were artificial. Counsel submits that the distinction between this kind of image and those of actual children is important when assessing objective seriousness, citing McEwen v Simmons & Anor [2008] NSWSC 1292.
	
	
	Dealing with the assessment of objective seriousness in respect of the material itself, the primary judge said –
	


“I am also mindful of the principles set out in R v Gent [2005] 162 ACR 29. There are a range of factors that bear upon the assessment of objective seriousness. In that case, four of the factors were set out as the nature and content of the pornographic material, including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed; the number of images or items of material possessed by the offender; whether the possession or importation is for the purposes of further sale or distribution; and whether the offender will profit from the offences.

In the decision of R v Minehan [2010] NSWCCA 140, Hulme J set out a number of further criteria to be taken into account in the assessment of objective seriousness of offences involving the possession or transmission or dissemination of child pornography. They are set out at para 94 of that judgment. There are 13 factors set out there; I will not repeat them for the purposes of this oral judgment. However, I have considered those factors and will address them in due course. Hulme J also stated that the list of factors is, of course, not closed. Individual cases may always provide further matters relevant to the assessment of objective seriousness.”


	
	Describing generally the material, her Honour said –
	


“During the course of sentencing, I have had the opportunity to view all the images for myself. A number of the images depict penetrative sexual activity involving young children, who appear to me to be between the ages of six and 12 years of age. A number of the images depicted a child or children bound with their hands tied behind their back. Other images portrayed gratuitous cruelty and humiliation, such as children being urinated on and being forced to swallow ejaculate and urine.

In one particular image, which was a close up of a face of a child who appears to be about six years old, the child appeared profoundly distressed. I am of the view that the extent of the cruelty depicted in some of the images increases the objective seriousness of those images. I have also taken into account, in assessing objective seriousness, the age of children depicted in the images. Whilst they were not babies or toddlers, many of the boys depicted in the images appeared to be as young as six years old. In my view, this is a factor that aggravates the seriousness of these offences.”


	
	Her Honour went on to discuss the present of aggravating features which the Crown contended and concluded –
	


“I am not of the view that this case falls into the worst case of offences of this type for the following reasons:

(1) I have found that it was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity;

(2) That the offender was not responsible for posting the images; and

(3) The offender did not profit from the offences.

I find, however, that the 91H(2) offences are objectively very serious and that the moral culpability of the offender is extremely high.”


	
	It is true that that the characterisation of the material does not distinguish between the particular sources of the images mentioned. However, her Honour had earlier described a number of other images and the applicant’s knowledge of particular children. I have omitted them for reasons of delicacy. The precise detail is not necessary for present purposes. It is reasonable to accept, perhaps, that the offence concerning the material on the hard drive was not so serious as those on the laptop or the flash drive but this does not mean that it was not also very serious. This is scarcely a matter that lends itself to nice distinctions. The images on each of the media involved many children who were abused in various ways; unless the differences are very substantial, in my view adding up the ways in each category will not demonstrate significant differences in the criminal culpability. It is not difficult or inappropriate in my opinion to assess the objective seriousness of images of the kind obtained by the applicant from the descriptions conventionally used in the CETS classification, though each classification, especially those which refer to actual sexual conduct, is in somewhat general terms.
	
	
	For obvious reasons, detailed description of the material in a particular case in a judgment which is to be widely published is not desirable unless the interests of transparency make it necessary. All that is necessary, in my view, is a description which enables an assessment that fairly explains the degree of seriousness ascribed by the sentencing judge to the material in question. In some cases, such as here, the primary judge described some images in some detail, no doubt to enable the parties, this Court and the general public, to be aware of the kind of material that was involved in the offences for which the applicant is sentenced. Here, the primary judge looked at the material herself. Counsel for the applicant did not suggest that this Court ought also to do so for the purpose of determining the appeal or, in particular, of assessing the correctness of the primary judge’s characterisation of the objective seriousness of each offence. It follows, I think, that the Court should act on the basis that nothing in the images themselves supports the argument that her Honour’s characterisation was mistaken.
	
	
	As the primary judge pointed out, it was an aggravating objective feature that the applicant was subject to an extended supervision order at the time, which had been imposed for repeated sexual offences. To my mind, the fact that the offence was committed whilst the applicant was on an extended supervision order designed to reduce the very high risk that he presented to the community for the commission sexual offences, moved the laptop offence from serious to that of “very serious”, pointing not only to the applicant’s moral culpability but also to the plain risk that he represented to the safety of the community. The relatively lesser seriousness of the laptop offence was reflected in the indicative two year sentence.
	
	
	Overall, the passages quoted above from the reasons of the primary judge, together with the enumeration of the images by reference to the CETS scale, demonstrate that, not only was her Honour not in error in describing the offences as “very serious” and the moral culpability of the applicant as “extremely high”, but was, with respect, plainly correct to do so.
	
	
	The fourth and fifth grounds of appeal may be considered together. The submissions of Mr Johnston focused on the indicative sentences. It is clear that the sentence for the breach of condition four of the extended supervision order was intended to be fully concurrent with the sentence for possessing the material on the DVD. This was obviously for the reason that, as the breach of the condition was the commission of the offence it would be double counting to sentence accumulatively. (I note that concurrency will not usually be sufficient to overcome the principle against double counting: Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at [45], [49]. However, this point was not taken and is, in the circumstances here, at all events of little practical significance.) The judge indicated, so far as the other five charges were concerned, that the sentence imposed for each would be partially accumulated. Counsel’s submissions then attempt to analyse the extent of accumulation. This is necessarily speculative and it does not seem to me that it was necessary, at all events, for her Honour to descend to this level of detail. It is evident that an overall sentence may be derived from an almost infinite variation in the dates of commencement of the various sentences that make it up. It seems to me that the only realistic way of dealing with the question of manifest injustice, is to consider the appropriateness of the individual indicative sentences and then whether the aggregate sentence fell outside the appropriate range. Accepting that each of the indicative sentences represents a 25 per cent discount for the utilitarian value of the applicant’s plea, I am unable to see that any of these sentences was not fully justified by relevant sentencing principles or, at the very least, that there is no basis for concluding that they were in error. It is clear that her Honour partially accumulated each of the other five offences to arrive at the resulting non-parole period of 6 years and 3 months with a balance term of 2 years. Such a sentence does not bespeak appealable error.
	


Conclusion


	
	I have pointed out that the primary judge, with respect, erred in relation to the assessment of the significance of the attitude of the applicant to taking anti-libidinal medication. Accepting that there is no proper basis for concluding that the applicant’s attitude to anti-libidinal medication justified an adverse inference about his attitude to the offences or his prospects for rehabilitation, I would nevertheless conclude, on the balance of the material, that the applicant has not demonstrated any genuine, let alone useful insight into his offending and his prospects of rehabilitation are extremely doubtful. The the nature of the abuse material and the character of his communications with Z demonstrates the considerable seriousness of, in particular, the offences against s 91H(2) and the breach of the supervision order constituted by his contact with children under 16 years. The breaches of the conditions of his supervision continued for a considerable time until discovered, essentially by accident, and were calculated to enable him to escape as much as he could the limitations of the supervision program and to enable further criminal activity. Considering all the relevant material for myself, I would certainly impose no lesser sentences than were indicated and no lesser aggregate sentence than that under appeal.
	
	
	The consequence is that I propose that leave to appeal should be granted but, pursuant to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	FAGAN J: I agree with the orders proposed by Adams J and I adopt his Honour’s summary of the facts relevant to the appeal. I make these observations of my own with respect to each of the grounds.
	
	
	Three of the counts to which the defendant pleaded guilty were of possession of child abuse material contrary to s 91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). They concerned, respectively, the following material (more fully described by Adams J at [7]):
	



	
	Video files and picture files on a Toshiba laptop computer;
	
	
	11 video files on a Gold DVD and
	
	
	picture files on a flash drive.
	



	
	The remaining three counts to which pleas of guilty were entered were of breaches of conditions of an extended supervision order to which the applicant was subject. Each breach was a contravention of s 12 Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW). The breaches were of the following conditions of that order, respectively:
	



	
	Condition 4, which provided that the applicant “must not commit any offence punishable by a period of imprisonment” during the term of the supervision order. The Commission of the offences against s 91H(2) as referred to at [49] constituted the breach.
	
	
	Condition 3, which required that the applicant comply with “any reasonable direction” given by an officer of the Department of Corrective Services allocated to the applicant’s case. He had been directed on 24 June 2012 to provide details of his internet user names and chat room names and he had failed to do so.
	
	
	Condition 9, which required that the applicant “must not associate or make contact with children under the age of 16 years unless in the presence of an adult previously approved by the department”. Breach of this condition was constituted by the applicant’s MSN chats with boys under 16 years as referred to by Adams J at [9].
	


Ground 1 – use of material from reports tendered by the Crown


	
	Ground 1 is:
	


“The sentencing judge erred by taking into account inaccurate extraneous and out of date material from the reports tendered by the Crown”.


	
	In the applicant’s written submissions this broadly stated ground has been narrowed to identify pages 24.1 to 26 of the Remarks on Sentence (“RoS”) as containing the alleged error. I consider that this passage has to be read with the second half of p 23 as well. Her Honour’s findings in this part of the Remarks may be fairly summarised as follows:
	



	
	Dr Samuels’ report of 11 May 2009 had been prepared pursuant to an order of the Court made under s 7(4) Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (as it was then known) in the proceedings in which the extended supervision order had been made, to commence 22 July 2009: State of New South Wales v O’Sullivan [2009] NSWSC 704. Dr Samuels had asked the applicant why he had refused anti-libidinal medication.
	
	
	The applicant had informed Dr Samuels on 7 May 2009 “that he had not actually refused it, but had heard bad things about it in jail. He also claimed he was about to begin a heterosexual relationship and he had concerns that such medication may affect his sexual functioning” (RoS 24.3).
	
	
	Anna Hoy, forensic psychologist, had reported on 6 March 2009 that the applicant had a number of risk factors for repeat paedophile offending (RoS 24.6). She had observed that the applicant had “developed good insight into his offending behaviour” and had “demonstrated progress” during a Custody Based Intensive Treatment (“CUBIT”) Program in early 2009. Ms Hoy “strongly recommended that he consider anti-libidinal medication to assist him in exerting appropriate self control” but he had not taken up this recommendation (RoS 25.2).
	
	
	As at 11 May 2009 Dr Samuels assessed the applicant “in the high risk category of offenders” and considered that if his proposed relationship with a female should fail then this would be a further risk factor (RoS 24.8). Her Honour found that the relationship had in fact ended “nearly before it started” (RoS 25.2).
	
	
	Mr McElhone, senior specialist psychologist, in a report dated 9 January 2009 had identified the applicant as in the high risk category for reoffending (RoS 25.5).
	
	
	Dr Hearps, psychiatrist, had reported on 7 July 2008 that the applicant had “demonstrated a pattern of sexual behaviour with pre-pubescent boys over a period of four decades. He fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for paedophilia. “Dr Hearps had recommended treatment with libido lowering medication”.
	



	
	Her Honour’s review of the psychiatrists’ and psychologists’ reports of mid-2008 to early 2009, as above, was immediately followed by this passage (at RoS 25.8 – 26.4), which the applicant now impugns:
	


“In the reports before me, the offender is assessed as a high risk offender. A recurrent recommendation of those professionals who dealt with him was that he consider anti-libidinal recommendation. In my view what is singularly missing in the reports is any expression of true remorse, contrition or even acknowledgment of the profound harm caused to children in the trade of supplying child abuse material for the purveyors of such images. In the most recent report of Community Corrections dated 16 March 2014 the offender, when asked about his attitude to the offending conduct, stated that his actions were ‘totally bloody stupid’. There is no evidence before me to establish that he is remorseful for his offending conduct. Indeed I find that the offender, whilst perhaps gaining a superficial insight into his offending conduct through his participation in the CUBIT program, continues to lack any genuine and deep understanding of the impact of the offending conduct on the children. The evidence establishes, in my view, a real likelihood that this offender will reoffend in the future. There is nothing before me that could give the Court any confidence that the offender has any prospects of rehabilitation.”


	
	With respect to these conclusions the applicant’s first proposition under Ground 1 is that the information regarding medical recommendations for anti-libidinal medication was “out of date” and hence “extraneous” or irrelevant. I do not consider that the 2008/2009 recommendations for this medication were “out of date” in the sense of no longer being applicable or relevant. They were based upon a record of persistent sex offending with young boys, mostly under 12 years, over 40 years from 1962 until 31 December 2002. The latter date was the end date of the charge period of the offences for which the applicant had been sentenced to imprisonment from 20 November 2003. He had been in prison and unable to offend further from then up to the dates of the reports.
	
	
	There was nothing before her Honour to suggest that the applicant’s entrenched pattern of behaviour which those reports described, in respect of the period from when he was about 16 years old (1962) to age 56 (late 2003), had changed in the five years between the dates of those reports and the date of the offences for which her Honour was sentencing him. On the contrary, the very offences to which he had pleaded guilty showed that in September 2012, only three and a half years after the reports had been written, he still appeared to have no ability to control his deviant sexual preoccupation.
	
	
	A Department of Corrective Services Progress Report dated 13 June 2011 concerning the applicant’s performance under the extended supervision order was before her Honour. It stated that he continued to be regarded as high risk and that he was being visited by a Compliance and Monitoring Officer every 28 days. The report stated that “his psychiatrist Dr Andrew Ellis” had requested the applicant to provide a blood sample for assessment of his suitability to be prescribed anti-libidinal medication. Dr Ellis was in the process of making such an assessment as at 13 June 2011.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge was well entitled to conclude (a) that the applicant remained at high risk of perpetrating further sexual offences; (b) that professional recommendations for anti-libidinal medication remained current and were soundly based having regard to what had happened since those recommendations were first made and (c) that the applicant was not, in fact, taking the medication. Irrespective of what the cause may have been for his not taking it – his own choice, delay in carrying out of the preliminary tests, failure of Control and Monitoring Officers to invoke Condition 28 of the extended supervision order (which required him to accept treatment if prescribed) or any other cause – the fact was that the manifest risk with respect to him was not diminishing of its own accord and was not being addressed by medical intervention. What mattered to the sentencing decision was her Honour’s well founded conclusion that, therefore, there was a “real likelihood that this offender will reoffend in the future” and that there was nothing to give the Court “any confidence that the offender has any prospects of rehabilitation”.
	
	
	Her Honour said (RoS 24.2): “As I understand it, the offender has, to date, refused to take such medication” (RoS 24.2). There were plenty of references in the 2008/2009 reports to his unwillingness to take the medication. The Progress report of 13 June 2011 noted that his then current position was: “he does not want to take the anti-libidinal, nor does he feel that he needs them”. A Pre-Sentence Report of 16 March 2014 recorded that it was “of major concern” to the Community Corrections Officer who authored the report “that the offender appears to have a significant lack of control over his sex offending behaviour and urges, and minimal or no insight into the risk factors and consequences of his actions”.
	
	
	Her Honour’s conclusion that the applicant had “to date, refused to take such medication” was supportable on this evidence. Certainly there was no evidence to show that he had pursued testing or done anything proactive to get himself on the medication. Whether he would maintain his frequently expressed unwillingness to take an anti-libidinal after Dr Ellis had assessed his blood results remained to be seen. But contrary to the applicant’s submissions it is not apparent that her Honour treated the applicant’s attitude to the medication “as an adverse factor at the time of sentencing”.
	
	
	A second complaint by the applicant in his submissions under Ground 1 is that in the passage quoted at [52] above her Honour “contextually linked the failure to take anti-libidinal drugs to her assessment of the applicant’s failure to express remorse, contrition or acknowledge the harm he has caused”. With respect, there is no such contextual link. Two discrete subjects are dealt with by her Honour, one after the other. The first is that he has been assessed as high risk, that medication has been recommended and that he is not taking it – hence, there is ongoing risk of him re-offending. The second is that he has shown no remorse, contrition or acknowledgment of harm done. It is not demonstrated that her Honour erroneously treated evidence in support of the first subject as proving or bearing upon the second.
	
	
	The applicant’s third submission in support of Ground 1 is that in the passage extracted at [52] above, her Honour held it against the applicant that there was no record of him expressing remorse, contrition or acknowledgment of harm to children flowing from the trade in child abuse material, in “the reports”. The applicant has submitted that there was only one report which post-dated the s 91H(2) offences namely that of Community Corrections of 16 March 2014. The applicant submits that her Honour has mistakenly expected to find reference to remorse and contrition concerning possession of child abuse material in the earlier reports of 2008 and 2009, up to which time such offences had not been committed.
	
	
	With respect, that is not a fair reading of her Honour’s reasons. It would have been perfectly apparent to her Honour that the only report which post-dated the s 91H(2) offences was the Community Corrections report of 16 March 2014. Her Honour referred to that report and quoted from it in the very next sentence of her Remarks. Fairly read the sense of this part of the RoS quoted at [52] is that expressions of remorse, contrition and recognition of harm to children were “singularly missing in the [relevant report]”.
	
	
	Fourthly the applicant complains under Ground 1 that her Honour overlooked [39] of the reasons of the Supreme Court, cited at [51] above, for making the extended supervision order in July 2009. It was there said that the applicant was in July 2009 taking medication which was expected to reduce his “unconventional sexual fantasies, urges and masturbation”. But in the 13 June 2011 Progress Report, which was also before her Honour, it was noted that the applicant was taking a medication “which additionally has a side effect of lowering the libido”. In the same paragraph of that report further detail was given of Dr Andrew Ellis having requested a blood sample and having undertaken testing for further medication. On this material it was open to her Honour to find that whatever medication he may have been taking in 2009 or even currently, his treating psychiatrist considered that something more was required – something which was not, at the date of sentencing, being taken.
	
	
	I would reject Ground 1 for these reasons.
	


Ground 2 – double counting for the breaches of extended supervision order


	
	Ground 2 is as follows:
	


“2. The sentencing judge erred by double-counting the aggravating feature of ‘breach of conditional liberty’ for the offences of breach extended supervision order”.


	
	The passage of the RoS which the applicant has identified in submissions as involving the double counting is the middle paragraph of the following portion of p 18:
	


“The Crown relied upon the decision in Andrew John Sivell v R [2009] NSWCCA 286 where Fullerton J held that the offender in that case was on conditional liberty by virtue of the fact that he was subject to prohibition orders made pursuant to the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act. Her Honour saw no justification in treating a breach of a bond, suspended sentence or breach of parole, for the purposes of s 21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act any differently from a breach of an order under the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act.

I accept, therefore, that by virtue of the fact that an offender was on an extended supervision order at the time he committed these offences, he was on conditional liberty, thereby constituting an aggravating feature.

In assessing the objective seriousness of the offences, I will also take into account the following; although the total number of images and videos were not as voluminous as many cases that come before the Court for these types of offences, 11 of the videos depict child abuse that is categorised as falling into the CETS scale 4. 88 photographs were also categorised as CETS scale 4” (emphasis added).


	
	In submissions in support of this ground the applicant has attempted to construe her Honour’s remarks, by the use of the general expression “these offences” in the middle paragraph of this passage, as treating the existence of the extended supervision order as a circumstance aggravating all of the offences – both those contrary to s 91H(2) and the breach of supervision order charges under s 12 Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act. I consider it quite clear that the expression “these offences” in the middle paragraph of the extract quoted above was intended by her Honour to refer only to the s 91H(2) matters. In the very next paragraph her Honour analysed the objective seriousness of what she again referred to as “the offences” expressly examining only the objective features of the s 91H(2) matters.
	
	
	The applicant’s argument attempts to attribute to her Honour the absurdity of treating the existence of an extended supervision order as a circumstance of aggravation, rather than an integral element, of the offences of breaching the order. The attempt is unjustified and unsuccessful. Ground 2 should be rejected.
	


Ground 3 – very high objective seriousness of substantive charges


	
	I respectfully adopt Adams J’s analysis at [35] – [42] of the detail of the nature and volume of the images recorded on each of the three media, respectively, which form the basis of the three charges under s 91H(2). The appellant’s submissions on this ground complain about her Honour’s attribution of a “very high” degree of seriousness to all three offences, given that the number of images, in particular the amount of higher classification material, on the DVD and the flash drive was greater than on the laptop. Yet counsel for the applicant effectively conceded that her Honour had taken this differentiation into account by submitting the following:
	


“The objective seriousness of the material located on the Toshiba laptop was not ‘very high’ given the limited number of the images and their relatively low classification. The judge implicitly accepted this assessment by providing an indicative sentence of two years for this offence”.


	
	Her Honour’s indicative sentence for each of the other two offences, concerning the DVD and flash drive respectively, was four years. Having acknowledged that her Honour recognised the lesser seriousness of the laptop offence by the adoption of a lower indicative sentence, it is difficult to see what sentencing error could be said to have arisen from her Honour’s use of the broad descriptor “very serious” applied to all three. Wherever there are three offences against the same section, if the facts warrant it they may without error all be described in general terms as “very serious” notwithstanding that they vary from one to another in degree of gravity.
	
	
	The applicant further submitted that her Honour’s use of this general descriptive characterisation, notwithstanding her implicit recognition of the lesser gravity of the laptop offence, “risks double counting”. That does not follow and I do not accept the submission.
	
	
	Finally, counsel argued:
	


“The indicated individual sentences are inflated by reference to this assessment [i.e. ‘very serious’] and which (sic) transfers to the aggregate sentence.”


	
	For the reasons given by Adams J at [44] in dealing with Grounds 4 and 5 (manifestly excessive sentence), the aggregate sentence imposed was not “inflated”. Nor, in my opinion, were the indicative individual sentences. Ground 3 should be rejected.
	


Grounds 4 and 5 – manifestly excessive sentence


	
	With respect to the applicant’s arguments under Grounds 4 and 5 that the aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive and failed to take into account the principle of totality, I do not wish to add anything to what Adams J has written at [44], with which I agree entirely. I would reject those grounds.

		22 December 2015",2015-12-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2768582,R v Hagan [2015] NSWDC 403,"Judgment


	
	Sean Hagan, for a young man of 24, has a long criminal record. I am sentencing him this afternoon because he committed an armed robbery against a taxi driver. In addition he robbed a man at an ATM a few days later. When I am sentencing him for the armed robbery he has asked me to take into account the robbery charge. He has pleaded guilty to that robbery charge. I take that into account and I sign a certificate to that effect.
	
	
	The armed robbery is against s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament regards it as serious. We can tell that because it fixes a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to that crime. The offence which I am asked to take into account of robbery is against s 94 of the Crimes Act. That carries a maximum of 14 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The armed robbery happened on 6 September 2014. The victim was a taxi driver in Walgett. At about 8.30 that night Mr Hagan got into the taxi and asked him to go to the Namoi Mission. That is about 2.5 kilometres outside Walgett. A short way into the journey Mr Hagan told the taxi driver, “You better slow down”. He repeated that and the driver began to slow down. Then what happened, according to the agreed facts in exhibit A, is that Mr Hagan took off his seatbelt and knelt up on the passenger seat facing the victim. He then produced a knife with a 6-7 inch blade, held it in the back of his right hand, with the blade running along the underside of his forearm.
	
	
	The driver stopped the taxi. Mr Hagan kept saying to the driver, “I’m going to stab you, I’m going to stab you. Give me your money.” The driver lifted his left arm and received a minor red mark on his wrist from the knife. Despite the driver saying, “There’s no need for that mate”, Mr Hagan said, “Give me the money, give me the money”.
	
	
	The driver gave him what was in his shirt pocket. Mr Hagan said, “All your money, all your money”. He opened the console in the middle of the taxi and gave him that money as well. Mr Hagan said, “Give me your phone too”. So the taxi driver handed over that. He had little choice. There was another man in the taxi at the time. Both men ran away. About $750 was taken from the taxi driver. Understandably the taxi driver “feared physical harm through the incident”. When he was eventually arrested Mr Hagan made full admissions about this crime.
	
	
	Two days after the armed robbery - on Monday 8 September 2014 - a man went to the Orange Credit Union ATM. He was at the ATM waiting for $140 to be dispensed when Mr Hagan “pushed the victim to his back shoulder”, clearing the way for him to take the money from the ATM. The victim attempted to hold Mr Hagan but lost his grip. Mr Hagan ran away with the victim in pursuit. Mr Hagan got away and the victim contacted the police. They tracked Mr Hagan down and arrested him. Again he admitted what he had done.
	
	
	As I said, Mr Hagan is only 24. He has a long criminal record which I also referred to. I should give some detail about that. He has been dealt with in the Children’s Court, in the Local Court and in the District Court. He has convictions for affray, car theft and resisting arrest. He has convictions for malicious damage, larceny and break, enter and steal. They were all in the Children’s Court and in the Local Court he has a conviction for assault. He has convictions for breaching an apprehended violence order and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was sent to prison for the last two offences by Local Court magistrates. In the District Court he has been dealt with for stealing from the person in 2011 and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. For both of those crimes he was sent to prison.
	
	
	When he committed these offences Mr Hagan was on parole from one of the earlier offences. He had been on parole since 21 June 2014 and his parole period was due to expire on 20 December 2014. He was therefore halfway through his parole when he committed these offences. Being on parole, as with any form of conditional liberty, is an aggravating factor when a judge is sentencing a person. It means that the authorities have exercised some leniency in fixing a non-parole period and ordering that the offender be released back into the community on parole. One condition is that the offender be of good behaviour. If he has breached that condition and abused the trust which he has been given that will affect the sentence which will be imposed. He was dealt with for breaching his parole and was ordered to serve out the balance of his parole. That order had effect from 30 September 2014, which is the date that Mr Hagan was arrested, and it expired on 6 February 2015.
	
	
	I am permitted to backdate the sentence. Normally the sentence I impose should commence on 7 February 2015 and there is an arguable case for that occurring here because Mr Hagan was heading for a breach in any event but I propose to backdate his sentence by one month. It will commence on 7 January 2015.
	
	
	There is a pre-sentence report prepared by a Community Corrections officer dated 7 October 2015. It notes that Mr Hagan has received community service in the past but his attitude towards completing the order was “deemed to be poor”. He has received good behaviour bonds and further community service orders. He has in the past failed to abide by his bail conditions and a warrant had to be issued for his arrest. He was given the benefit of parole in 2013 but his “response to supervision” was deemed to be “superficial” in that he did not attend required programs as directed to address factors that contributed to his “criminogenic behaviour”.
	
	
	Again in 2014 for another parole period, his “response to supervision was considered poor”. He was tested in 2014, while on parole, for prohibited drugs and those tests disclosed that he had been using cannabis and methylamphetamine as well as other drugs. Breach proceedings were in progress when he was arrested for this offence. That is why it is arguable that the current sentence could commence when the balance of parole expired but I will give him the benefit of one month.
	
	
	The report noted that Mr Hagan “grew up in a home marred by alcohol fuelled domestic violence”. He does not remember his father but was told that his father had been “murdered in Sydney some time” after he left home. He came under the care of relatives, “boys’ homes and the Department of Community Services”.
	
	
	Mr Hagan had a relationship for four years but it ended in 2012. There is a daughter who has a serious medical condition. Her name is Magenta. He has another daughter, Jade, now aged 8, from a previous relationship.
	
	
	When he is eventually released Mr Hagan said he will live with his mother in the Bathurst area. He left school at the start of year 8. He had trouble with drug use and truanting. He has not held long-term employment and before he went into gaol was receiving a Centrelink benefits. He has had a drug problem for some years and he spoke of using heroin, methylamphetamine and Xanax. He went onto the methadone program whilst he was in custody but at one stage on remand had a positive urinalysis. He is on some medication in gaol but acknowledged to the Community Corrections officer that “he would not be involved in violent offending if he was not in the drugs”.
	
	
	Mr Hagan expressed his sorrow for being involved in the offence but explained that he was “grossly drug affected”. The Community Corrections officer expressed some concern that Mr Hagan “now believes that on the methadone program he is rehabilitated”. The officer assessed him as at a high risk of reoffending. The officer thought he was in need of psychological assessment and counselling. The officer thought he would benefit from a period of supervision in the community once released.
	
	
	Mr C Dane, solicitor, who appeared for Mr Hagan, arranged for him to be psychologically assessed by the well-respected forensic psychologist Anne Robilliard. She prepared a report which became exhibit 1. She confirmed much of the history which had been taken by the Community Corrections officer. Mr Hagan started smoking cannabis as early as the age of 12 and graduated onto more serious drugs as he grew older. He expressed his regret to the psychologist as well. She assessed his intelligence range as being below average and his risk of reoffending as being high to moderate.
	
	
	The psychologist noted Mr Hagan’s exposure to physical abuse throughout his formative years. She observed that being the “victim of violence as a child generally shapes an implicit acceptance of violence as a normal problem solving strategy”. Apparently Mr Hagan had said to her that he is now old enough to realise that violence is not okay. Noting his intelligence assessment the psychologist observed that individuals with “patterns of scores like this often act out aggressively when their level of frustration of being unable to adequately express themselves verbally, overwhelms behavioural control, although this was not particularly relevant”. In this case Ms Robilliard thought that the “impact of negative and abusive treatment during formative years has shaped his current attitudes and behaviours”. She concluded that Mr Hagan’s “criminal behaviour is essentially a product of the coalescence of his addictive predisposition, negative experience of formative years and limited cognitive ability to reason an re-evaluate his attitudes and redirect his behaviour”. His prognosis depends upon him obtaining professional assistance and Ms Robilliard recommended some programs which are available in custody.
	


HIS HONOUR: I’ll just suspend my remarks there. Mr Dane, I don’t know whether you’ve had an opportunity to get instructions on this question. It is normally helpful to send the Corrective Services a copy of material such as a psychologist’s report. Corrective Services make it clear that such independent reports can be very helpful in classification and contain a lot of information, diagnoses, et cetera, that are very helpful. I don’t know what your instructions are. If you want an opportunity for us to clear the Court when I have finished sentencing your client you can get those instructions and I’ll come back and deal with it.

DANE: Thank you your Honour I very much appreciate that.


	
	Mr Dane called his client’s mother to give evidence. She said that whilst she was pregnant with Mr Hagan she was drinking a lot. She acknowledged that both she and Mr Hagan’s father were alcoholics and that his father left when Mr Hagan was small. But a relationship with another partner was affected by domestic violence over many years when Mr Hagan was still present and he was exposed to it.
	
	
	Cross-examined by Ms T Hennessy, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, she acknowledged that Mr Hagan had seen the domestic violence and himself had been the victim of it as well. He had spent some time with a great aunt. There was also another aunt he had spent time with but there was also domestic violence in that household as well.
	
	
	Mr Dane called his client. Mr Hagan acknowledged that the information in the psychologist’s report was all true and that an aunt of his in Walgett had been the subject of domestic violence, so that in both places - his mother’s and his aunt’s - he had been exposed to that. He was kicked out of school at the age of 13 and started drinking and smoking. He was 17 when he met his first partner and the daughter from that union is Jade who is now 8. He talked about Magenta and her treatment and pointed out to me last week and this morning that she has had to be treated again for a possible recurrence of her serious illness. His daughter normally lives with her mother in Canberra.
	
	
	Mr Hagan acknowledged that when he was released on parole in 2014 he started using heroin and ice and did not last long at all without using those substances. He decided to rob the taxi driver as he was going home, and normally carried the knife with him. He expressed his remorse for the crime that he had committed and for both victims, the taxi driver and the man at the ATM, saying that he was on drugs and did not really know what he was doing. Time in custody had given him a long time to think about his life.
	
	
	He was using drugs whilst in gaol at first but then he stopped. He realised he had to do something. It took a few weeks but he got some help and got himself on to the methadone program. He is eating better and putting on weight and is concerned as a father for his daughter. He wants to get himself straightened out when he is released from gaol and try to find a job. He is interested in Aboriginal art and has done some while in custody.
	
	
	Cross-examined by Ms Hennessy, he acknowledged that the taxi driver he robbed was the only taxi driver in Walgett. Asked about getting back on to the drugs when he had been released on parole in June 2014 he said he had split up with his girlfriend and was not coping with the stress so returned to using drugs. He is hoping to stay on the methadone program and hopes to re-engage with his family and daughter and to get assistance from professional counselling including residential rehabilitation if necessary. He has become used to drugs and alcohol being part of his normal pattern of behaviour and realises that it is no longer acceptable.
	
	
	I was considerably assisted by very detailed written submissions by Mr Dane, those submissions became MFI 2. He examined the objective features of his client’s criminal behaviour. He argued that his client’s early plea should attract a discount of 25% and Ms Hennessy acknowledged that. Mr Dane drew my attention to the guideline judgment delivered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and acknowledged that his client was a young offender but that he is not an offender “with little or no criminal history”. On the contrary, I add, he has a significant history. I agree that he had a serious weapon and that there was a limited degree of violence and the normal but completely unacceptable kind of violence in these kinds of cases. The victim was vulnerable. It could not be said that a small amount was taken because it, in my opinion, may have been a significant amount for a taxi driver on a shift. He pleaded guilty at an early opportunity.
	
	
	I do not accept that, as Mr Dane argued, the overall result is that the offence is at the low end of objective seriousness so far as this kind of offence is concerned. In my opinion it lies squarely in the middle of that range.
	
	
	Mr Dane looked at the aggravating and mitigating factors under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I agree with him that the fact that the offence involved the actual threatened use of a weapon is not a separate aggravating feature. It is part of the crime of armed robbery and a factor which was taken into account no doubt by the legislature in providing for the maximum sentence.
	
	
	His client does have significant previous convictions. I accept that they are not “serious personal violence offences”, but they do include offences of stealing from the person and assault and larceny. These are factors which I can take into account when assessing where in a range I should fix the sentence, bearing in mind the fact that the offender has exhibited a disregard for the law over many years. I agree that the injury, emotional loss or harm to the victim was serious but no more serious than any armed robbery would be. It is very significant to be a victim of an armed robbery and very traumatic but there is no evidence enabling me to make a finding that it is any more than usual or that it should constitute a separate aggravating factor.
	
	
	Mr Dane realistically acknowledges that his client was on conditional liberty and that is an aggravating factor. I cannot find that his client has good prospects of rehabilitation. I can hope, given his increase in age and the insight that he is receiving, that he will; but he has not to date. I accept his remorse. I do not accept the submission that he has provided assistance to the authorities in the sense provided for in s 21A(3)(m). Nor do I accept that he should get an Ellis discount.
	
	
	Mr Dane took me to four significant factors which are personal to his client. He relied heavily on his client’s background and referred me to the decision of the High Court in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571, reminding me of what the plurality had said at [40] that the “experience of growing up in an environment of social deprivation may leave its mark on a person through their life and may compromise the person’s capacity to mature and learn from experience”. That does not diminish with age. I accept Mr Dane’s submission that his client is “to some extent the product or victim of normalised dysfunction” and that he has “a compromised capacity” to learn from experience.
	
	
	The second factor was his client’s youth. His client of course is not a child but an adult; but he is an adult in his mid-twenties. Mr Dane referred me to the remarks of the late Hodgson JA in R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 159 at [4]. I give weight to those observations and to his client’s relatively young years.
	
	
	I take into account his client’s drug addiction as the third factor drawn to my attention by Mr Dane and the remarks made by Simpson J (as her Honour then was) in Henry and by Wood J (as his Honour then was).
	
	
	I do not agree that Mr Dane’s client could be said to be at a “crossroads”. Nevertheless, the impact of the use of drugs points to his state of mind or capacity to exercise judgment or planning - he had none at the time. It is not a mitigating factor as such but more like reducing the objective seriousness of his behaviour.
	
	
	The fourth factor pointed out by Mr Dane was the risk of institutionalisation. I agree that there is a risk of that occurring. Normally when a judge imposes a sentence the non-parole period or time that the offender must spend in gaol is about 75% of that sentence. Mr Dane argued that there are special circumstances for reducing that. One of the circumstances was his client’s risk of institutionalisation. He referred to his client’s demonstrated potential for rehabilitation. I do not accept that. But I do accept that his client has a high need of rehabilitation and adjustment back into the community in order to avoid the risk of institutionalisation. They are special circumstances.
	
	
	I have taken into account the arguments which Mr Dane put forward about the statistics made available by the Judicial Commission. Ms Hennessy pointed to the fact that Mr Hagan had held up the only taxi driver in Walgett who was in an extremely vulnerable position. I agree. She acknowledged that Mr Hagan’s moral culpability was reduced by his disadvantaged background and by exposure to drugs and alcohol and violence as part of his upbringing. She acknowledged the impact of institutionalisation and argued against his prospects of rehabilitation being good. I accept that submission. She said that the Henry guideline applies.
	
	
	I come now to consider, in light of those submissions, the appropriate sentence which should be imposed. As I said, I regard the offending as within the middle of the Henry guideline, but I need to take into account as well the fact that Mr Hagan was on conditional liberty. He had significant relevant prior convictions. And I need to take into account the robbery from the man at the ATM.
	
	
	I originally had in mind a period of six years as an appropriate sentence. But because of Mr Dane’s submissions about his client’s personal circumstances I am going to reduce that sentence to five years imprisonment.
	
	
	A sentence of five years imprisonment would normally bring with it a non-parole period of three years and nine months, that is 75% of five years. I am going to reduce the non-parole period of Mr Hagan’s case to two years and nine months.
	


HIS HONOUR: I will sentence you now Mr Hagan.


	
	I sentence you to five years imprisonment to commence on 7 January 2015 and to expire on 5 January 2020. The non-parole period when you must stay in gaol is two years and nine months. That, too, commenced on 7 January 2015. It will expire on 5 October 2017. The first date on which you will be eligible for parole is therefore 5 October 2017. The Parole Authority will assess you for parole then.
	


HIS HONOUR: Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: How long will I be in gaol?

HIS HONOUR: You come up for parole 5 October 2017. So that is about a year and 10 months from now.

OFFENDER: Excuse me your Honour can I speak to my solicitor after this happens on the phone please because I don’t understand what you are saying and he can explain it to me.

HIS HONOUR: We will do that and we will make sure you do understand.

OFFENDER: Thank you.

HIS HONOUR: First I will ask whether there are any matters of fact or law that I should deal with.

HENNESSY: Can I ask whether your Honour came to the conclusion as to five years after the discount of 25% as well? Your Honour did make reference to it earlier but it is not in the calculations.

HIS HONOUR: You are quite right. Anything else?

HENNESSY: No your Honour.


	
	Mr Hagan must benefit from that. Mr Hagan I am going to explain things again and then, Mr Dane, I am going to give you the chance to explain things to him, because the prosecutor drew my attention to the fact that I had not allowed for the 25% discount because you pleaded guilty and she was right. My guess is that Mr Dane would have picked that up quickly too, but she did first.
	
	
	So I regard an appropriate sentence as five years. I discount that by 25% so your sentence is three years and nine months. Normally, for a sentence of three years and nine months, the non-parole period would be two years and nine months, that is 75%. I am going to fix a non-parole period of two years so that the overall sentence will be three years and nine months, commencing 7 January 2015 and expiring on 5 October 2018. The non-parole period is two years commencing 7 January 2015 and expiring 6 January 2017. Your first date you will be eligible for parole is 6 January 2017.
	


SHORT ADJOURNMENT

HIS HONOUR: Mr Dane, the psychological report?

DANE: I have spoken to Mr Hagan about that. He is willing and hoping I can send the report to the welfare officer at the gaol. I’m not sure if your Honour has a method through which that might be done.

HIS HONOUR: We know how to do it; so we have the original, I have marked it in pencil, my Associate faxes it to a number.

DANE: Thank you.


	
	I will direct my Associate to send a copy of exhibit 1 to Corrective Services.
	


HIS HONOUR: Anything else?

DANE: No, Mr Hagan understands the breakdown.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Hagan your gaol sentence is three years and nine months. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yeah.

HIS HONOUR: I have backdated it to start on 7 January this year. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yeah.

HIS HONOUR: So you are already serving it, do you understand, so it expires three years and nine months later so it finally expires on 5 October 2018. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yeah.

HIS HONOUR: You know what a non-parole period is?

OFFENDER: Yeah that’s the time I have to do in gaol.

HIS HONOUR: You’re right. Exactly. That started on the same day, 7 January this year. That is only two years. It is less than it normally is because I am worried you might be getting too used to gaol and also you are a young man and you need to get yourself sorted out in the community. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: So your parole is going to come up on 6 January 2017, that is two years after January this year, your parole date, 6 January 2017. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yeah.

HIS HONOUR: Right, that’s the important date. I don’t order your parole but the Parole Authority sorts it out and that will probably depend on lots of things including how you behave yourself in gaol. Do you understand?

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: You will be told when it’s coming up and you will need to make your application for parole. But the date is 7 January 2017. All right?

OFFENDER: Yeah.

HIS HONOUR: You were going to go away with a longer sentence but it is shorter because I forgot to do the discount so you have done a bit better than I expected.

OFFENDER: Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: That’s all right and I hope your little girl gets better. All right, do you understand?

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right, now look keep up the good work. Are you still on the methadone or not?

OFFENDER: Yeah.

HIS HONOUR: All right well you try to do that and take whatever help they can offer you in gaol and then we have to get you out and hopefully sort it out in the community because you just have to stop what you are doing when you get on the drugs.

OFFENDER: Yeah. I had a think about where my life is going down the track and I want to keep from going down that path. I want to change… (not transcribable)…

HIS HONOUR: Good that’s very good.

OFFENDER: I don’t want friends, I don’t want drugs, I don’t want that, I want my family, I want to be there for my family and yeah.

HIS HONOUR: Good. All right well you will need a lot of help doing that, a lot of help because it’s not easy but you need to accept the help that you are offered, let people help you.

OFFENDER: Yeah.

HIS HONOUR: All right good luck.

OFFENDER: Thank you your Honour. Can I go now?

HIS HONOUR: Yeah you can go now.

OFFENDER: Yeah, thank you.

2768584,R v Golonski [2015] NSWDC 402,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing Jason Golonski. He is a man who, his counsel says, has had a tragic life. But he has also committed a lot of crimes during that life. They include the three crimes that I am sentencing him for today as well as a series of other crimes that I am asked to deal with.
	
	
	First I should say what the crimes are. He has committed two offences of break, enter and steal. They are crimes against s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Each of them carries a maximum of 14 years imprisonment. The third crime I am sentencing him for is a more serious version of the same offence. It is an aggravated break, enter and steal. On that occasion he broke in when people were at home. Parliament regards that as even more serious and has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to that offence. Not only that, Parliament has fixed a standard non-parole period of five years to that offence.
	
	
	It is important for a judge in sentencing someone to say something about what happened to bring about the offences so that an assessment can be made of how serious an example of the crime that particular offence is. The judge also says something about the offender so that the offender’s personal circumstances are taken into account as well as the crime that the offender committed.
	
	
	In September, during almost all of September last year, Jason Golonski went on a spree of stealing. He was addicted to the drug known commonly as ice. He had a ready supply of it and was really out of control for some weeks. Briefly, this is what he did.
	
	
	Starting towards the beginning, on Friday 5 September 2014, he stole a car. He was driving the car a few days later again but was disqualified from driving at the time, so he committed another offence of driving whilst disqualified.
	
	
	About a week later, Thursday 11 September, he stole some meat from a farm shed on a property in Nashdale, which is not far from Orange where Jason Golonski came before me for sentencing when I was sitting there on circuit last month. That was an offence of stealing from a dwelling.
	
	
	Next he committed one of the crimes that I am actually sentencing him for, a break, enter and steal. There was a property known as ‘Ashbrook’ in Nashdale. There was a shed where the owner kept a Harley Davidson motorcycle. The owner also kept locked gun safes. Jason Golonski broke in and stole nine firearms from one of the gun safes. All of those firearms are listed in exhibit A, tab 4. He also took some ammunition, as well as some clothing - a black leather motorcycle jacket with a Harley Davidson pin. The value of the property he stole on that occasion was some $30,000.
	
	
	He stole another car and drove it, therefore committing two crimes: stealing a car and driving whilst disqualified. He also committed an offence of having goods in custody.
	
	
	Around the same time, he committed the offence of larceny on a property in Lindhurst. He stole things like alcohol and keys and coins and a watch. This time the amount of property he stole was worth about $4,000.
	
	
	Again he stole another car a few days later and drove it, thereby committing the offence of stealing a motor vehicle and driving whilst disqualified.
	
	
	Another offence of break, entering and stealing occurred a few days later in Cowra. This time he actually broke into a property and used it to shower and change and sleep in. He helped himself to food and drink in the fridge.
	
	
	A few days later, he was found with some ice in his possession and he was charged with possessing a prohibited drug. In fact he was charged with supplying that drug on a deemed basis, but he defended that charge and I found him not guilty. He has pleaded guilty to possessing the drug.
	
	
	Around 14 September 2014 he broke into a property in Forest Reefs, got into the garage and stole assorted drills, motorcycle body armour, helmets and a wippa snippa. I am sentencing him for that crime. It is one of the break, enter and steal offences.
	
	
	Another break, enter and steal offence was committed in Grenfell where he stole fishing rods and a toolbox.
	
	
	On 18 September 2014 the people who lived in a place in Amaroo Drive, Cowra, went to bed with their two children aged six and nine months. At a quarter to 1 that morning, Jason Golonski got into the house. He got in through an unlocked door. He looked through both levels of the house. He got $60 from a purse and some car keys. He stole some clothes and then drove off. Of course he was charged with stealing the car and driving whilst disqualified but, more significantly, he was charged with the aggravated break, enter and steal. On that occasion he had broken into a house whilst the parents and two young children were at home. That is the most serious of the three offences that I am sentencing him for apart from some related and backup offences.
	
	
	Jason Golonski was arrested at Moree on 21 September 2014 after police chased him. He confessed all of his offences to the police. He admitted that the drugs that he had in his possession were there because he had “ripped off his drug dealer”. The scenes of the crimes examined by the police disclosed a lot of objective evidence, such as DNA pointing towards Jason Golonski. He made a further interview and made what are described as full and frank admissions.
	
	
	So the three primary offences I am sentencing him for are a break, enter and steal committed at Nashdale over the period 9-12 September 2014 (that is where he stole firearms and other property worth about $30,000); I am sentencing him for a break, enter and steal at Forest Reefs committed over 14 15 September 2014 (that is where he stole a motorbike and some associated property); and an aggravated break, enter and steal committed on 19 September 2014 at Cowra where he stole some cash and clothes.
	
	
	As I said, Mr Golonski has a criminal record. It is quite extensive in New South Wales. He has a record for stealing cars and has been in custody twice for that. He has a record for assault. After being given a chance, he was called up and sent to gaol. He has a record which includes receiving stolen property. He received gaol penalties for that. He also has traffic offences.
	
	
	Mr Golonski has a Victorian criminal record. It started in 1992 and goes through to 2011. Almost all, if not all, of the offences were dealt with in the Magistrates’ Court. They include the offences of stealing a car and burglary. He was given custody regularly by the Victorian magistrates.
	
	
	Jason Golonski is now 42 and has spent a good deal of his adult life in prison.
	
	
	Offenders will often write a letter to the judge sentencing them and Jason Golonski wrote one as well. I might add he gave an account in giving evidence which confirms much of what is in the letter, acknowledged his long record. He also said that he had been living on the street in Melbourne since he was 15 as well as in refuges. He had very little family support. His sister went through the same experience. She is living in Victoria with her children and may be able to offer him a place when he is released. But he has no family or friends or ties in New South Wales.
	
	
	Mr Golonski makes it clear that he cannot cope on parole. He always fails, he says frankly. He says that he has breached seven of the eight paroles that he has received, so he would prefer a straight sentence. I will return to that. He wants to get an interstate transfer, eventually, so that he can return to Victoria.    
	
	
	The crimes, Mr Golonski acknowledged, were “mostly due to me running from my dealer and police at the same time”. He said he was “not eating, not sleeping and using large amounts of that ice to keep going”. He was extremely paranoid, at the point of being delusional. In fact he gives an account, which he elaborated on in evidence, of being quite delusional and hearing voices during one of the crimes that he committed. He said that he feels “so bad that I did what I did and those people did not deserve to get their property stolen, especially the people at Amaroo Avenue in Cowra”. He acknowledges that he was not behaving like himself because of the influence of drugs. It took him some time and medication since he has been in prison for more than 12 months “to get my mind straight again”. He will, he says, not touch drugs again. He enjoys drawing and was employed in a tattoo parlour for about 18 months at one stage. He hopes to get a job doing that when he is released.
	
	
	Mr W. Walsh of counsel, who appeared for Mr Golonski, called him to give evidence last week. He has been in custody since he was arrested. His evidence is that he has been in custody from 20 September 2014. I am going to accept that evidence and just fix the dates that I proposed.
	
	
	Mr Golonski confirmed that his sister lives in Victoria with her seven children. His mother died of cancer and his real father lives in Germany. He had a stepfather but has a rough relationship with him. He has some contact with his stepbrothers’ family or brothers in Victoria but not in recent years.
	
	
	Mr Golonski did a market gardening apprenticeship at one stage but had to stop it because of gaol. He confirmed that he had spent 18 months or so working in a tattoo parlour in Bathurst and had spent a good deal of his life living on the street, being homeless or in prison. He thought that he was getting institutionalised.
	
	
	Mr Golonski’s problems were alcohol and drugs. He started with cannabis and then went on to amphetamines and then to methamphetamines. He said that he was hearing voices. That sounds to a lay person like he had a mental health condition. But there is no medical evidence which supports that, although I note that he is being treated with medication in prison. He says that the medication he is given in prison is an antipsychotic medication and he has been on it for some time. I accept that evidence. It makes a difference, he says, and it slows his mind down.
	
	
	Mr Golonski is on protection, he admitted frankly, because the person whom he stole the ice from he gave up to the police and that person is also in custody.
	
	
	Mr Golonski explained why he wanted a fixed term, because he keeps failing on parole and wants to live with a clean slate. I should at this stage indicate that I cannot comply with that request. I do not know whether I would be inclined to or not. I can see the force of what he says. It makes a lot of sense and he knows himself better than we do. But legally one of the crimes that he committed carries a standard non-parole period and the Court of Criminal Appeal has made it clear that I cannot decline to set a non-parole period for that offence and therefore a period on parole. This will eventually be to his benefit because the non-parole period will mean that he spends less time in gaol.
	
	
	Mr Golonski knows that he is wanted in Victoria for similar crimes and he expects that he will be arrested when he has finished his time in prison in New South Wales. He acknowledges the seriousness of his offending and said, frankly, that no one deserves stuff to be stolen and that he feels particularly bad about the people who were asleep in their house when he broke in. He said that the crime spree was because he was using too much ice.
	
	
	Mr Walsh asked his client about being on protection and whether it made any difference. He said that it did. It meant that he cannot get around as easily; it is harsher; there are fewer facilities and more lock-ins; there are fewer opportunities for education and work. He repeated that he would like to return to the tattooing work that he really enjoyed. He is not sure where he will live on his release. He has not yet spoken to his sister.
	
	
	Cross examined by Ms T Hennessy, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Golonski said that he started drinking when he was about 15 or 16. He had been kicked out of home, he said. He said that his mother took him and his sister and dropped them at a hostel refuge and left them there. He started on drugs, which included cannabis and amphetamines. That gradually increased. He started taking ice around 2001 or 2002. It was, of course, an addictive and expensive habit. He confirmed that he struggles on the outside but that in prison his mind is clearer because he is not taking drugs and the medication is working. He is prepared to accept counselling to try to deal with his problems.
	
	
	Written submissions were prepared by Mr L. Shaw of counsel, who appeared as Crown Prosecutor in Orange, and they became MFI 1. I have read and taken those into account.
	
	
	Mr Walsh acknowledged in his submissions the connection between the criminal behaviour and the drug taking which he said was an explanation but not an excuse. He pointed out that his client had made an early plea of guilty, which Ms Hennessy acknowledged, and expressed remorse, which she also acknowledged. He pointed to his client’s tragic life and the risk of institutionalisation and argued that he is, nevertheless, not beyond redemption. He said that his client was frank and apparently gave honest evidence. I am inclined to agree with that, as was Ms Hennessy. Mr Walsh emphasised that his client is still only 42 and that his term in prison would be served in protection and reminded me of the brief period of employment which was in a job that he enjoyed.
	
	
	Ms Hennessy acknowledged that the offences which Mr Golonski had committed were serious but unremarkable break, enter and steal offences which were low on the scale of relative seriousness. She acknowledged that his personal circumstances were very sad. She acknowledged the risk of institutionalisation. Mr Golonski’s prospects of rehabilitation cannot be called good, realistically. She suggested, and I think she is correct, that failing to give a non-parole period at all may be at odds with one of the purposes of sentencing and pointed out in later submissions that I cannot decline to set a non-parole period for the s 112(2) offence. She made submissions regarding the related and backup offences which I will come to in due shortly.
	
	
	MFI 3 confirms that the pleas of guilty were entered at the earliest available opportunity. As I said, I will give Mr Golonski the benefit of the doubt on the one day and his sentence will commence on 20 September 2014.
	
	
	I am going to fix an aggregate sentence. That means I will indicate what the individual sentences would have been for the three crimes, but instead of setting those individual sentences I will fix one aggregate sentence before I return to the related and backup offences.
	
	
	There is a tariff or a range for the kinds of crimes which Mr Golonski committed. In respect of the two break, enter and steal offences, objectively speaking his crimes are in the lower end of the range of objective seriousness but his criminal record for these kinds of crimes means that within that range it would tend to be higher rather that lower within that band. For each of those two crimes I have in mind an overall sentence of five years imprisonment.
	
	
	For the aggravated break, enter and steal, again it is within the low end of that kind of crime but within that band, because of his criminal record, is further up the scale. That is because of the emphasis which the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 places on the fact that a person has a previous criminal record for similar offences. I would regard an appropriate sentence for that offence as six years imprisonment.
	
	
	However, Mr Golonski has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity on each occasion. So, instead of the six year prison sentence, I will impose a four and a half year prison sentence. Instead of the four year prison sentence, I would impose prison sentences of three and three quarter years.
	
	
	Of course, if I accumulated those and fixed them to be served one after the other, Mr Golonski would end up serving 12 years imprisonment. That would be too severe. There needs to be some overlap in the sentences because the crimes, although they had different victims, were committed in one episode of criminal behaviour over some weeks. I would have accumulated the sentences partially with the end result being a sentence of six years imprisonment. For a sentence of six years imprisonment, Parliament envisages that normally a non-parole period would be three quarters of that, namely four and a half years in prison. Because Mr Golonski is serving some of his time in gaol, if not all of it, in protection, and because of the risk to him of being institutionalised, I will reduce that non parole period to four years imprisonment.
	
	
	So the overall sentence will be six years imprisonment and the non-parole period will be four years imprisonment.
	
	
	I am asked by Ms Hennessy to deal with a series of further offences committed by Mr Golonski over the same period. They are less serious offences. I have listed them all at the commencement of these remarks and they include the various theft of cars and driving whilst disqualified and other examples. One of the offences is a backup offence and that was the offence of possessing a prohibited drug.
	
	
	Ms Hennessy also reminded me that I need to bear in mind that I am limited to the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court of two years in respect of all these offences. She took me to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act and, more significantly, to the definition of a backup offence and a related offence in s 165. I had raised some concern about whether some of the offences on the list were indeed related offences. A related offence is defined in s 165(1) as an offence that is a summary offence or an indictable offence that is capable of being dealt with summarily by the Local Court, but it also must arise “from substantially the same circumstances as those from which the first indictable offence has arisen”.
	
	
	I am sentencing Mr Golonski for three indictable offences. Ms Hennessy frankly pointed out that charges 1 to 4 in the schedule of offences which appear in tab 3 of exhibit A are arguably not related offences because they may not arise from substantially the same circumstances. I agree with her. She provided MFI 2 which was a helpful summary of the various offences. I accept what she submitted in MFI 2 regarding charges 1 to 4 and I would remit those offences to the Local Court. Regarding offence 5 I agree that it is related and I would sentence Mr Golonski to 12 months imprisonment to commence on the same date as the other sentence I am imposing. For the backup offence I would sentence Mr Golonski to six months to commence on the same day. Charges 9 and 10 I accept her submission that they are related offences and I would sentence him to 12 months on each of those offences. Charges 11, 12 and 13 I accept her submission that they are not related and I would remit those to the Local Court. I agree that charge 14 is related and I would impose a conviction under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999. I agree with her that charges 15 and 19 are not related and I would remit those. Charge 18 I accept is related and I would sentence Mr Golonski to three months imprisonment to commence on the same day.
	


HIS HONOUR:   I will sentence you now, Mr Golonski.


	
	I fix a non-parole period of four years imprisonment. That commenced when you were arrested on 20 September 2014. It will expire on 19 September 2018. The balance of your sentence is two years commencing 20 September 2018 and it will expire on 19 September 2020. So your overall sentence is six years. It started last year when you were arrested on 20 September 2014. It will finally expire on 19 September 2020. You have four years you must serve, starting last year and finishing on 19 September 2018. On 19 September 2018 you are eligible for parole. The Parole Authority decides that. And for the reasons that I have given, the legal reasons, I cannot not set a non-parole period.

2768591,State of New South Wales v Pacey [2015] NSWSC 1983,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: By summons filed on 30 October 2015 the State seeks the following relief:
	



	
	An order pursuant to s 7(4) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006:
	



	
	Appointing two qualified psychiatrists and/or psychologists, or a combination of each, to conduct separate examinations of the defendant and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations by a date to be fixed by the Court;
	
	
	Directing the defendant to attend those examinations.
	



	
	An order pursuant to s 10B of the Act that the defendant be subject to an interim supervision order from 31 December 2015 for a period of 28 days.
	
	
	Further, an order pursuant to s 11 of the Act directing the defendant, for the period of the interim supervision order, to comply with the conditions set out in the Schedule to the summons.
	



	
	The prayers for relief in the summons are based upon the following supporting documentation:
	



	
	Affidavit of Elizabeth Wells sworn 30 October 2015.
	
	
	Affidavit of Elizabeth Wells sworn 5 November 2015 and the exhibit “EW-1” to that affidavit.
	
	
	Affidavit of Elizabeth Wells sworn 26 November 2015.
	



	
	The orders are opposed. For the reasons that follow, I am not satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order: s 7(4). It follows that the application must be dismissed: s 7(5).
	


Background


	
	The defendant was born in April 1979 and turns 37 next year. He is of Aboriginal descent and was raised on aboriginal missions in Forster and Taree. He has a criminal history dating back to the Children’s Court in 1992. Mr Pacey’s first appearance in an adult court was in the Local Court in 1997 for break, enter and steal for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months. He was subsequently imprisoned for other offences thereafter.
	
	
	On 18 May 2007 Mr Pacey was involved in an incident for which he was originally charged with cause wounding/grievous bodily harm to person with intent to murder and maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to do so. He pleaded guilty to the alternative offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent and was sentenced on 9 September 2009 to 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years. That was an offence under s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 and carried a maximum sentence of 25 years, with a standard non-parole period of 7 years.
	
	
	Mr Pacey was released on parole on 21 October 2015 to reside in Nunyara Community Offender Support Program Centre. He still lives there. Mr Pacey’s sentence expires on 31 December 2015.
	


Legislative scheme


	
	The issues that I am required to determine are a function of the following provisions of the Act:
	


“4 Definitions

In this Act:

‘violent offender’ means a person over the age of 18 years who has at any time been sentenced to imprisonment following his or her conviction for a serious violence offence.

5A Definition of ‘serious violence offence’

(1) For the purposes of this Act, a ‘serious violence offence’ is a serious indictable offence that is constituted by a person:

(a) engaging in conduct that causes the death of another person or grievous bodily harm to another person, with the intention of causing, or while being reckless as to causing, the death of another person or grievous or actual bodily harm to another person, or

(b) attempting to commit, or conspiring with or inciting another person to commit, an offence of a kind referred to in paragraph (a).

(2) An offence that includes the elements referred to in subsection (1) (a) is a serious violence offence regardless of how those elements are expressed, and whether or not the offence includes other elements.

(3) …

5E High risk violent offender

(1) An offender can be made the subject of a high risk violent offender extended supervision order or a high risk violent offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk violent offender.

(2) An offender is a ‘high risk violent offender’ if the offender is a violent offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(3) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious violence offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence.

5J Application for high risk violent offender extended supervision order

(1) An application for a high risk violent offender extended supervision order may be made only in respect of a supervised violent offender.

(2) A ‘supervised violent offender’ is a violent offender who, when the application for the order is made, is in custody or under supervision (referred to in this Part as the offender’s ‘current custody or supervision’):

(a) while serving a sentence of imprisonment:

(i) for a serious violence offence, or

(ii) for an offence under section 12, or

(iii) for another offence which is being served concurrently or consecutively, or partly concurrently and partly consecutively, with one or more sentences of imprisonment referred to in subparagraph (i) or (ii), or

(b) pursuant to an existing extended supervision order or continuing detention order.

(3) A person is taken to be serving a sentence of imprisonment whether the sentence is being served by way of full-time detention, intensive correction in the community or home detention and whether the offender is in custody or on release on parole.

10B Interim supervision order-high risk violent offender

The Supreme Court may make an order for the interim supervision of an offender if, in proceedings for an extended supervision order, it appears to the Court:

(a) that the offender’s current custody or supervision will expire before the proceedings are determined, and

(b) that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a high risk violent offender extended supervision order.”


	
	The proceedings before me are a preliminary hearing: s 7(3). For the purposes of this preliminary hearing, having regard to the way in which the matter has been conducted, the only issue that I am required to determine is whether Mr Pacey is a high risk violent offender. Before a finding to that effect can be made, I must be satisfied to a high degree of probability that he poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if not kept under supervision: s 5E(2).
	
	
	The task of the court and its purpose at the preliminary hearing stage was described in State of New South Wales v Manners [2008] NSWSC 1242 at [8] – [9]:
	


“[8] In Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119 at [98], the Court of Appeal emphasised that the task of the Court, at the preliminary hearing stage, was not to weigh up the documentation or to predict the ultimate result or to consider what evidence the Defendant might call at the final hearing. It has been said that the test to be applied at this stage is similar to the prima facie case test applied by magistrates as part of committal proceedings: Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Hayter at [6]; State of New South Wales v Brookes [2008] NSWSC 150 at [13].

[9] One purpose of the preliminary hearing procedure is to allow the Court to filter out unmeritorious applications at an early stage. Another purpose is to give the Court the benefit of the expert opinions of two independent witnesses before making a final decision.”


	
	At preliminary hearings, dealing with interim orders, the threshold question is to be resolved without a weighing of the documentation or predicting the ultimate result and without regard to what evidence the offender might call at a final hearing: Tillman at [98]. It is however appropriate to give weight to risk avoidance: Attorney General for New South Wales v Winters [2007] NSWSC 611 at [7]. It is also appropriate to bear in mind that the “fundamental objective of the legislature is the protection of the public” and the safety of the community: Attorney General for New South Wales v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340 at [21]; Attorney General for New South Wales v Quinn [2007] NSWSC 873 at [10].
	
	
	Section 5E(1) of the Act provides that an offender can only be made subject to an order “if and only if” he or she is a high risk violent offender. McClellan CJ at CL referred to this expression in Gallagher at [34] as follows:
	


“[34] The meaning of those words has not been fully argued on this application. However, for the present purposes I accept that before an order can be made I must be satisfied of the likelihood that the defendant will reoffend to a high degree of probability. It presently seems to me that the act imposes a standard of proof higher than the ordinary civil standard but less than the criminal standard beyond reasonable doubt. The caution that an order can only be made ‘if and only if’ the Court is relevantly satisfied emphasises the care with which the Court must approach the question of whether to make orders imposing continuing restrictions, in whatever form, on a person’s liberty. One potential difficulty with the subsection is the conjunction of that requirement i.e. that the Court be satisfied to a ‘high degree of probability’, with the question of whether the offender is ‘likely to commit a further serious sex offence.’ The word ‘likely’ presently appears to me to be used in its ordinary meaning which, as the High Court pointed out in Boughy v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR at 10 conveys the notion of ‘substantial - a real and not remote – chance regardless of whether it is less or more than 50 percent’: see also R v SLD (2003) 58 NSWLR 589 at 32; Teremoana (1990) 49 A Crim R 207 at 217; Dowling v Dalgety Australia Limited (1992) 34 FCR 109 at 136.


	
	In Cornwall v Attorney General for New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 374 at [21], the Court of Appeal observed that:
	


“[21] The expression ‘a high degree of probability’ indicates something ‘beyond more probably than not’; so that the existence of the risk, that is the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, does have to be proved to a higher degree than the normal civil standard of proof, though not to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, the risk or likelihood itself does not have to be a probability to the civil standard of proof, but rather a sufficiently substantial probability to satisfy the criterion ‘likely’ as explained in TSL.”


	
	With particular regard to the risk of an offender committing a serious violence offence, the definition of that term in s 5A informs the nature of the risk that must be considered. In State of New South Wales v Lynn [2013] NSWSC 1147 at [16], Button J observed that:
	


“[16] At its lowest, on analysis a serious violence offence could be an offence that features an act causing grievous bodily harm done with foresight of the possibility that actual bodily harm could occur. An example that springs to mind is punching someone to the face whilst realising that it is possible that the victim will receive a split lip and the victim, as a result of the punch, falling back and hits his or her head on concrete and suffering a very large laceration to his or her head. Clearly, the concept of a serious violence offence is not confined to offences of homicide, or even the intentional infliction of serious violence.”


	
	In Lynn, the offender had a great many convictions for offences of violence of which a “great majority … [were] not of the greatest seriousness”: [20]. However, his Honour went on at [27] to say this:
	


“[27] Eighthly, in light of the lack of seriousness of many of the offences committed by the defendant, whilst it may be that it would be difficult for any judicial officer to be satisfied that there is an unacceptable risk of the defendant committing another homicide, or an offence that involves the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm, as I have demonstrated that is not the definition of a serious violence offence that in turn forms an element of the test in s 5E of the Act. The definition is much broader than that.”

The evidence


	
	Section 9(3) of the Act lists the matters that must be taken into account by the Court on an application for an extended supervision order. Some of the matters listed necessarily inform the present exercise. Section 9(3) is in these terms:
	


“9 Determination of application for extended supervision order

(1) …

(3) In determining whether or not to make an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant:

(a) the safety of the community,

(b) the reports received from the persons appointed under section 7 (4) to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such examination,

(c) the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further relevant offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such assessment,

(d) the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further relevant offence,

(d1) any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community,

(e) any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs,

(f) the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order,

(g) the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004,

(h) the offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history,

(h1) the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender,

(i) any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature (in the case of an application for a high risk sex offender extended supervision order) or serious violence offences (in the case of an application for a high risk violent offender extended supervision order).”

Criminal history and views of sentencing court: s 9(3)(h) and (h1)


	
	A risk assessment report dated 30 June 2015 was prepared by Ms Karen Chapman. Ms Chapman is a registered senior psychologist with Corrective Services. Part of Ms Chapman’s report summarised matters relating to Mr Pacey as follows:
	


“Mr Pacey is a 36 year old male who committed the offence of Maliciously Inflict Grievous Bodily Harm with Intent to do so against a male victim known to him, when he was 27 years of age. He has a record of persistent non-violent offending and previous convictions for violent offending from the age of 17 years.

He has never successfully completed a period of supervision under conditional release, nor progressed to facilitate an opportunity to participate in external work/leave programs whilst in custody.

Based on available information Mr Pacey presents as a high risk violent reoffending relative to other male offenders. He is considered generally untreated as he has not participated in a high-intensity treatment program aimed at addressing his risk of violence. He is able to express some insight into his risk factors, and would require additional support to develop a clearly articulated self-management plan to reduce the risk of future violent offending.”


	
	The index offence was committed on 18 May 2007. Mr Pacey was at that time serving a period of 9 months on parole following a 16 month sentence for an assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2006. The sentencing judge described the events that made up the offence in these terms:
	


“The offence arises out of an incident that took place at the rear of a block of apartments in Parkway Avenue, Bar Beach. … The victim lived in one of the upstairs apartments. He said that he had seen the offender, whom he had previously not known, approximately one week before the offence. He said that the offender was sitting with a female. He did not speak to him on that occasion.

The victim said that he saw the offender again at a friend’s place, in Union Street, The Junction. On that occasion the offender enquired about some drugs. The victim said that he has no knowledge of where drugs might be produced and walked on. The victim said that approximately three or four days later, namely on the day of the offence, he saw the offender again, this time at the back of the unit occupied by the victim’s friend, Joanne Morier. Miss Morier was having an argument with the female, who had previously been seen in the company of the offender.

When the victim heard the altercation he was in Miss Morier’s unit, on the second floor. The offender invited him to fight. The victim declined and walked back towards the stairs leading up to Miss Morier’s apartment. He said that as he walked into the foyer he was aware of the offender behind him. He went on to say, ‘He has a blade in his hand – he has a knife in his hands and I was shocked. I didn’t know why he was there. I put my right foot out, my left hand out. I said, “Come on mate, don’t be stupid.” I put my left hand out, my right hand out and my right foot to try to block the blow and he came under that blow and scored a stab in my right triceps and cut my triceps in half. I looked down at my triceps and there was a gaping wound, about three inches wide and I just reacted on the instant and I put two or three to his face, or around his head, and after that he reacted to that, he pushed me up against a wall. I said more or less, “Do you want to kill me?” He stabbed me, he said “You’re dead cunt” and stabbed me again.’

The victim described the knife as a six inch Bowie knife, similar to a carving knife. The victim said that the stabbing happened in quick succession. …”


	
	It was not in dispute that the victim sustained a severe wound to a triceps muscle and two deep stab wounds to the abdomen that penetrated the lining of the abdominal cavity and made an opening into the stomach. There was also a superficial cut to the liver and a partial injury to the upper part of the diaphragm just near the top of the heart. These wounds were all surgically repaired. The victim remained in hospital for nine days.
	
	
	The sentencing judge observed that the offence was serious and warranted a sentence of full time custody. His Honour accepted that Mr Pacey was institutionalised and that he would require a lengthy period of close supervision and support upon his release from custody. He recommended that the process of assimilating him into the community should begin while Mr Pacey was still in custody.
	
	
	During his interview with Ms Chapman, Mr Pacey acknowledged that he had inflicted the injuries to the victim but remained adamant that he was not intoxicated at the time he did so. He said he was attempting to purchase drugs. He continued to maintain, although the sentencing judge disbelieved, that the assault was in response to being grabbed and threatened by the victim and that he was himself fearful for his own safety.
	


Compliance with obligations: s 9(3) (f) and (g)


	
	Since 1999 Mr Pacey has been returned to custody on four occasions to serve the balance of his parole. This has been due to failures to report, alcohol and drug use and further offending. With the exception of the index offence, none of Mr Pacey’s returns to custody has involved an offence of violence.
	
	
	At the time of the commission of that offence, Mr Pacey was on parole for the offence of AOABH, for which he had been sentenced to 16 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months. The sentence was to commence on 4 September 2006. He was released on parole on 3 March 2007 and was arrested for the index offence on 24 May 2007. He served the balance of his AOABH sentence, which expired on 9 March 2008.
	
	
	During the term of Mr Pacey’s current sentence, and preceding his release on parole on 21 October 2015, he had previously been released on two occasions. Within a week of being released for the first time on 11 December 2012, Mr Pacey was found to be in possession a prohibited drug. On 11 February 2013 he was charged with two counts of possession and two counts of common assault. He was sentenced to the rising of the court on the drug charges. Relevantly for present purposes, no evidence was offered in relation to the alleged assaults. His parole was revoked on 8 March 2013 but not with respect to an offence or allegation of violence.
	
	
	Mr Pacey was again released on parole on 30 August 2013. His parole was later revoked a second time for drug and alcohol breaches and failing to report. No offence or allegation of violence was involved.
	


Any other information: s 9(3)(i)


	
	Since entering into the custody of Corrective Services, Mr Pacey has been charged with 40 institutional misconduct charges. Five of these have related to fighting in 2000, 2004, 2007, 2009 and 2013. Mr Pacey disputes the incident referable to 2013. Mr Pacey has also been charged with two institutional misconduct charges of intimidation in 2003 and 2007.
	
	
	Ms Chapman opined that Mr Pacey showed some signs of long term institutionalisation. He has only been out of custody for about 28 months in 17 years. Mr Pacey does not appear to have been recently cognitively assessed. Ms Chapman reported about that as follows:
	


“His memory appeared intact for recent and remote events, except for occasions when he was significantly intoxicated. He was well oriented to time, place and person. His concentration and attention were both adequate. He appeared to be functioning within average limits of intelligence.”


	
	Ms Chapman’s recent findings are to be compared with a cognitive assessment undertaken by Mr Pacey in 2000. At that time he was found to be functioning in the low-average range of intelligence.
	
	
	Mr Pacey has a significant and lengthy history of drug and alcohol misuse from as young as 10 years of age. He was smoking heroin by the age of 17, injecting it by the age of 21 and he commenced using ice in 2004. Ms Chapman commented upon this area in her report as follows:
	


“45. … Mr Pacey was approved for methadone treatment previously, having been treated for approximately 5 years whilst in custody. He ceased in 2013 after requesting to reduce his dose to nil before his release. Mr pacey stated he is currently on the waiting list ‘to go back on methadone’, and that he has been repeatedly requesting Justice Health staff to check where his referral was up to. … Recommencing treatment on methadone is considered an important factor to reduce relapse into significant illicit drug use on release.

…

47. When asked about his health in interview, Mr Pacey reported that he was generally healthy, and had received Interferon treatment for Hepatitis C that was now completed. Mr Pacey commented that he would be unable to consume alcohol in the future due to the liver damage cause by Hepatitis C. …”

Participation in rehabilitation programs: s 9(3)(e)


	
	Prior to the development of the Violent Offenders Therapeutic Program (VOTP), Corrective Services offered the Violence Prevention Program (VPP) at Malabar Special Programmes Centre for medium to high risk violent offenders. Mr Pacey was accepted into the VPP assessment phase on 16 October 2000 but was discharged on 8 December 2008 for allegedly fighting with another inmate.
	
	
	Mr Pacey was referred to the VOTP on 17 December 2009 and was offered a place and accepted. He was, however, ultimately unable to take it up.
	
	
	Despite not having participated in these high intensity programs for violent offenders, Mr Pacey has participated in some short term programs including Managing Emotions, Getting SMART (and SMART Recovery) and EQUIPS Programs. Additional programs in which Mr Pacey has participated include Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Aboriginal drug and alcohol awareness, Aboriginal Relapse Prevention, Anger Management, OFFIT AOD programs and various other vocational and educational programs. Mr Pacey also sought individual contact with several psychologists while in custody for assistance following the deaths of family members.
	


Assessment of offender committing further offences: s 9(3)(c)


	
	Ms Chapman indicated in her report that it was “not scientifically possible to accurately predict whether or not an individual offender will or will not actually reoffend.” She went on to observe that the
	


“69. … best that can be offered is an estimate that is anchored to empirical literature specifying features associated with risk and sound clinical analysis and formulation of how those present features might operate in the individual subject to the assessment.”


	
	Ms Chapman’s report contains a subheading “Risk Scenarios” under which she offered the following opinions:
	


“85. Mr Pacey has not been found guilty of a serious incident of violence since he was incarcerated for the index offence, nor while he was released to Parole, despite engaging in high risk behaviour including drug and alcohol use. The boundaries and structure in custody, and limited time spent at liberty may not have provided significant exposure to triggers that could impact on his behaviour.

86. The primary concern rising from the present assessment is the lack of adequate time Mr Pacey will have under community supervision due to the time remaining on his original sentence, and therefore opportunities to further test any self-management skills or strategies under those conditions.”


	
	Under the heading “OVERALL RISK”, and presumably having regard to the preceding qualification, Ms Chapman went on to opine as follows:
	


“89. The overall totality of evidence suggests that Mr Pacey falls toward the lower end of the High risk category of violent offending relative to other adult male violent offenders.

Mr Pacey has demonstrated some understanding of his risk factors for violence and made some observable efforts to address these factors. These changes were made in recent years, and it is not yet possible to know if these changes will be stable across an extended period of time and when challenged by high risk situations. Although Mr Pacey has not engaged in high-intensity treatment regarding his violence, he has demonstrated some insight into his risk factors. If he does not undertake a high intensity program, he will require ongoing intervention to adequately address his risk factors and need related to successful community reintegration.”


	
	Ms Chapman commenced her Conclusions and Recommendations in these terms:
	


“90. Mr Pacey is a 36 year old man whose risk of violent offending is estimated to be in the High risk category relative to other men who have offended violently. It is unclear whether any future violence would meet the threshold of a “Serious Violent [sic] Offence as described under the [Act]. Mr Pacey’s past violent history indicates the capacity to engage in serious violence, his recent behaviour over the past several years suggests that he has developed some skills in managing his behaviour without engaging in violence at the serious end of the spectrum. However the extent that he can use these strategies to manage the risk during an extended period in the community remains untested.”

Report as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community: s 9(3)(d1)


	
	It is not apparently in dispute that Mr Pacey would benefit from continued management in the community and would be amenable to appropriate supervision and direction.
	


Safety of the community: s 9(3)(a)


	
	The safety of the community is the primary object of the Act. The factors otherwise listed in s 9(3) are centrally concerned with and directed to ensuring, as far as possible, that Mr Pacey will not be released from custody without appropriate and adequate supervision if he is a high risk violent offender and I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that he poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if he is not kept under supervision.
	


Further evidence


	
	On the application of the State, the proceedings were urgently relisted before me on 23 December 2015. I was informed that Mr Pacey had been returned to custody on 19 December 2015 when his parole was revoked following what is described as non-compliance. On 20 December 2015 Mr Pacey was arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty and resisting arrest the previous day.
	
	
	The State has provided me with an affidavit sworn on 23 December 2015 by Jonathan Vasiliou. That affidavit was read without objection. The material to which Mr Vasiliou deposes has been drawn to my attention quite properly by the State on the basis that it represents information concerning Mr Pacey that is arguably germane to the present application. It is not suggested that any of the events that led to the revocation of Mr Pacey’s parole or his arrest constitute or amount to the alleged commission of a serious violence offence.
	
	
	Mr Pacey was granted conditional bail in the Local Court when the new matters came before Central Local Court on 21 December 2015. He is due to appear again at the Downing Centre on 8 February 2016 when the matters are listed for reply.
	


Consideration


	
	As I have already indicated, the only issue in dispute between the parties is whether or not Mr Pacey is a high risk violent offender. The State maintains that he is and that I would be satisfied of that fact. Mr Pacey contests any such conclusion or finding.
	
	
	The combined effect of the operative words of s 5E(1) and (2) require that Mr Pacey can be made the subject of a high risk violent offender extended supervision order if and only if I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that he poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if he is not kept under supervision.
	
	
	It is perhaps trite to observe that the assessment of the ordinary meaning of the unacceptability of any risk involves at least notionally the arithmetical product of the consequences of the risk should it eventuate on the one hand and the likelihood that it will eventuate on the other hand. A very high risk of occurrence of something that is insignificant, or a very low risk of occurrence of something that is significant, are both risks of similar or corresponding proportions, but neither risk could be considered to be unacceptable. For the purposes of the issue that has to be considered under the Act, the question is whether I can be satisfied that there is an unacceptable risk that Mr Pacey will commit a serious violence offence, not that he might commit some lesser act of violence not meeting or falling short of that definition. The test therefore narrows to an assessment of whether or not there is a high degree of probability that Mr Pacey poses an unacceptable risk of committing such an offence.
	
	
	The assessment that I am required to make on this application for orders pursuant to s 7(4) and s 10B of the Act is the equivalent of an inquiry into the existence of a prima facie case. It nevertheless follows that the difficult task that is to be undertaken necessarily involves a balancing exercise taking into account all of the positive and negative material in the supporting documentation, based upon the assumption that it can ultimately be proved. That assumption is not difficult to make in this case, and is only complicated by the need critically to analyse the competing inferences that emerge from the material when it has been. Certain matters in the supporting documentation provide an example of what I mean. For instance, Ms Chapman considered what she described as potential protective factors, about which she said the following:
	


“Potential protective factors

87. Protective factors are the individual or contextual strengths that might decrease or offset risk of violence.

88. Mr Pacey possesses protective factors that potentially assist in reducing his violence by increasing the chance of living a pro-social lifestyle. These protective factors include:

(i) Mr Pacey has members of his extended family that [sic, who] are not involved in crime and are reportedly willing to support him.

(ii) He has expressed a strong desire to gain employment and provide material and emotional support, along with being a positive role model to his 12 year old daughter.

(iii) Mr Pacey has been well educated in Aboriginal cultural issues, and he states that he would like to ensure the stories and traditions of his people are recorded and taught to the younger generations. He understands that he cannot be a positive influence whilst using illicit substances and engaging in crime.

(iv) Good health and fitness – Mr Pacey would be physically able to work in areas of vocational interest such as with hordes on a property or in house building/carpentry.”


	
	I note in this last respect that a recent announcement by the Federal Minister for Health indicated that anti-viral drugs reputed to cure the Hepatitis C virus will now be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and presumably available to Mr Pacey from March 2016 for a very reasonable sum, whereas they had only previously been available at very high cost.
	
	
	Any consideration of the risk posed by Mr Pacey must accommodate these so called protective factors. However, it is not correct to describe them as “potential” protective factors, any more than it is correct to describe the index offence as a potential negative factor. All of the indices that are relevant to the equation by which the acceptability of the risk is calculated are potential factors because there is no necessary or direct link or connection between any one of them and the risk being assessed. Neither in terms of statistical probability nor historical certainty can any one factor be said to be always or completely reliable.
	
	
	Before I can make an order, I must be satisfied of the likelihood that Mr Pacey will reoffend to a high degree of probability. That is a standard that is higher than the civil standard of more probable than not or on the balance of probabilities. Because Mr Pacey’s unfettered and unrestricted liberty in the community is in issue, I can make an order if and only if I am satisfied to that degree of satisfaction that he is a high risk violent offender.
	
	
	Mr Pacey has only ever been convicted of committing one serious violence offence. The case for the State proceeds upon the basis that that index offence in combination with all of the other material referred to in Ms Wells’ affidavits produces a conclusion that Mr Pacey is a high risk violent offender. In my opinion, taken at its highest, that material indicates without question that Mr Pacey is by definition a serious violent offender, but I am not satisfied to a high degree of probability, or indeed anything like it, that he poses an unacceptable risk of committing another serious violence offence.
	
	
	Mr Pacey is nearly 37. He has not been convicted of any offence since the index offence. I accept immediately that a very significant reason for that has been his custodial status, but it is in my view nonetheless an important matter to note as an historical artefact. I have in this regard also taken note of the disciplinary incidents involving Mr Pacey within the prison system, but they are small in number, widely spaced and qualitatively of little significance. There is in my view no valuable predictive assistance to be drawn from fights in prisons between or among inmates that are not themselves productive of harm that would otherwise qualify the incidents as serious violence offences.
	
	
	Mr Pacey has also been co-operative with Ms Chapman and has shown what appears to be a genuine desire to reform. He has demonstrated insight into his drug and alcohol difficulties, which are said by Ms Chapman to have had a close connection both with his previous offending and with the likelihood of reoffending. That insight is a positive or protective factor to be taken into account in Mr Pacey’s favour.
	
	
	Ms Chapman’s opinions set out at paragraph 90 of her report are also particularly instructive and need to be properly understood. Ms Chapman considers that Mr Pacey’s risk of offending is in the high risk category, although she elsewhere indicated that he was in the lower end of that category. However, she also expresses the opinion that it is unclear whether any future violence would meet the threshold of a serious violence offence, which is the very type of offence with which s 5E(2) is relevantly concerned. It is clear from the terms of the Act that violence not amounting to a serious violence offence can be ignored. In describing the fact that Mr Pacey’s “past violent history indicates the capacity to engage in serious violence”, Ms Chapman can only be referring to the index offence, as there is no other incident of serious violence as defined with which he has been concerned. I consider the fact that Mr Pacey has not committed any serious violence offence or offences apart from the index offence to be very significant.
	
	
	However, whatever current views might be generated by or about that single incident, now more than 8 years and 7 months ago, Ms Chapman immediately notes that Mr Pacey’s recent behaviour over the past several years suggests that he has developed some skills in managing his behaviour without engaging in violence “at the serious end of the spectrum.” Violence that is not at the serious end of the spectrum neither amounts to a serious violence offence nor presumably provides reliable predictive assistance with respect to future violent conduct. Ms Chapman’s comment is also implicitly supportive of my view, expressed earlier, that Mr Pacey’s isolation from the community is not a negative or neutralising factor in the context of his abstinence from violence and corresponding lack of convictions. Indeed, on one view, Mr Pacey’s incarceration would have exposed him regularly to situations that would have been conducive to the commission of serious acts of violence, yet his institutional conduct suggests that no such incidents occurred. He convincingly explained his fighting in gaol to Ms Chapman by telling her that his conduct was necessary to project an image of fearlessness to avoid being targeted, saying, “you can’t back down or everyone thinks you’re weak.”
	
	
	It goes without saying that the safety of the community is a matter of great importance both generally and as a central theme in the inspiration for, and implementation of, applications such as the present. That does not however equate either to an indication by the legislature or to a necessary acceptance by me that offenders who have in all relevant respects served their sentences and become entitled to be released on parole should be made subject to supervision orders simply because their release is associated with some risk. Indeed, rates of recidivism indicate that a high percentage of offenders who are released into the community are by definition at some risk of reoffending. In contrast to the general prison population, what the Act makes abundantly clear is that only those offenders who are at risk of reoffending in a particular way are to be subjected to the prospect of continuing or extended supervision following their release.
	
	
	Mr Pacey is at some risk of reoffending. That does not set him apart from a very large number of those with whom he has been incarcerated. The material that I have considered does not, however, satisfy me that there is an identifiable risk of sufficient probability to indicate that he is a high risk violent offender. As I have indicated already, Mr Pacey does not in my opinion qualify as a high risk violent offender because I am not satisfied that he poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if he is not kept under supervision. Adopting the formulation suggested in Manners at [8], I am not satisfied that there is a prima facie case for the making of an order under s 7(4) or s 10B of the Act.
	
	
	I should indicate finally, and for the avoidance of doubt, that in considering the meaning of the words “unacceptable risk”, I consider that they should be given their ordinary meaning. I have in that respect preferred the analysis of R A Hulme J in State of New South Wales v Thomas (Final) 2011 NSWSC 307 over any alternative approach that suggests the need to conduct a balancing exercise of some kind.
	


Conclusions and orders


	
	I am not satisfied that the wealth of material in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order. It follows that I am not required to make an order pursuant to s 7(4) or s 10B of the Act.
	
	
	Accordingly, the summons should be dismissed with costs.

		23 December 2015",2015-12-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768601,Field v R [2015] NSWCCA 332,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: On 15 July 2012 Mr Kelvin Kane sustained a fatal injury when he was punched on the left of his jaw. The applicant, Mr Craig Field, was charged with his murder under s 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Although the applicant accepted at his trial that he had punched Mr Kane immediately before Mr Kane collapsed, the applicant did not accept that that blow caused Mr Kane’s death. Instead, he contended that the Crown had not proved beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Shaun Fathers, another person involved in an altercation occurring at the time, had not earlier delivered a punch that was the cause of Mr Kane’s death.
	
	
	On 9 December 2014 the jury before whom the applicant was tried returned a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. On 17 December 2014 the applicant was sentenced to a term of 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months.
	
	
	As the applicant’s sole ground of appeal against his conviction is that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the whole of the evidence (s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)), he requires, and seeks, leave to appeal.
	
	
	He also seeks leave to appeal against his sentence on the following ground:
	


“The sentence was manifestly excessive having regard to the protean nature of manslaughter. Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 [226]-[227]”.


	
	Mr Kane’s death occurred at about 9.00pm on Sunday 15 July 2012 during an altercation in the carpark of the Kingscliff Beach Hotel at Kingscliff, New South Wales. As the circumstances leading up to the altercation in the carpark are not of significance in relation to the applicant’s conviction appeal (primarily because the applicant accepted that he hit Mr Kane immediately before he collapsed), it is sufficient to commence by describing the events in the carpark that night.
	
	
	At approximately 8.45pm that night Ms Lauren Grainger and her partner, Mr Mark Frost, together with their friends, Ms Lynn Burger and Mr Kane, left the smoking area/beer garden of the hotel and moved towards a silver Holden Rodeo utility motor vehicle in the carpark in which Ms Grainger was to drive them away from the hotel. Ms Grainger, Mr Frost and Ms Burger seated themselves in the vehicle and, as Mr Kane was stepping into it, Mr Shaun Fathers (nicknamed “Feathers”) instigated a confrontation with Mr Kane. The applicant was present at this time, as was the hotel’s manager, Mr Geoffrey Wallis. There had been various confrontations between the members of the two groups at the hotel earlier that day.
	
	
	I turn now to summarise the relevant witnesses’ evidence at the trial concerning the circumstances leading to, and cause of, Mr Kane’s death.
	


THE EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL

Ms Lauren Grainger


	
	Ms Grainger was in the driver’s seat of the vehicle when she heard someone shout. She got out of the vehicle, went around it and saw Mr Fathers trying to punch Mr Kane who was near the rear passenger side (Transcript pp 382, 399). She did not see any of those punches connect. She said that Mr Kane had his hands up, saying: “why are you trying to fight me, why are you fighting me?” (Transcript p 382) and that his palms were open and his fingers were pointing upwards. As the altercation continued, she did not see any further punches, rather the two men “were just kind of dancing at each other”. She came between them, facing Mr Fathers, and tried to push him away from Mr Kane with her hands (Transcript p 384). Mr Fathers then said: “[g]et the fuck out of the way or I’m going to knock you out”, to which she replied: “I’m not going anywhere”.
	
	
	By this time, Ms Grainger was standing at the back of the vehicle’s tray on the driver’s side with Mr Fathers “off to [her] left”. Mr Kane was out of her line of sight but she thought that he was on her other side. The next thing that she remembered was hearing “yelling and then [she] turned around and Kelvin [Mr Kane] was on the ground” (Transcript p 386). Her evidence was that Mr Fathers was off to her side about three or four steps away from where Mr Kane lay, with Ms Grainger between them. She could not remember where Mr Field was standing but said that she probably did see him at the time (Transcript p 387). She remembered seeing Mr Kane on the ground, on his back, with a trickle of blood on his right temple (Transcript p 412).
	


Ms Lynn Burger


	
	Ms Burger’s evidence was that when she was seated in the vehicle, she felt it shake as if someone had bumped it. She got out and saw people standing around near it in “a bit of a circle”. Mr Fathers was facing Mr Kane. Someone was restraining Mr Fathers but she did not know who and could not recall who was present in the circle (Transcript p 523-4). She described the situation as “noisy” and “messy” with people yelling, including Mr Fathers who yelled abuse at Ms Burger such as calling her a “f’n dog”. She said that there was “plenty of pushing and shoving and people being restrained and people yelling” but she did not see “any punches or any blows exchanged” (Transcript p 524). At one point Ms Burger grabbed the back of Mr Kane’s belt intending to “get him out of there”.
	
	
	She said that Mr Kane put “his hands in the air and he was backing away and then [Mr Fathers] was in front of [Mr Kane] and then [she] was just to the back of [Mr Fathers] and then Craig Field came around from behind [her] …”. She said that the applicant came from her left and that Mr Kane and Mr Fathers were in front of her and “just a little bit off to the side” (Transcript p 525). Mr Kane was facing her and Mr Fathers had his back to her. The applicant then came from her left, Mr Fathers stepped to the right and then the applicant hit Mr Kane. She said that Mr Kane had both hands up with his fingers pointed towards the sky. He was backing away “with his hands like that [and] he said ‘[l]isten mate I don’t want to fight you, I don’t even know who you are’”. This was directed at Mr Fathers.
	
	
	Mr Kane fell straight backwards when the applicant punched him. Ms Burger could not tell how hard the hit was but said it was with a closed fist to the left side of Mr Kane’s face near his left temple. When he fell, she heard “a thud like someone’s head hitting concrete.” When assisting Mr Kane, she saw blood on his left temple area (Transcript p 529). She answered “[d]efinitely not” when asked whether she had seen anyone other than the applicant hit Mr Kane on the evening in question (Transcript p 530).
	
	
	In cross-examination she agreed that in a statement to the police she had said that Mr Fathers “came up and started throwing punches” at Mr Kane (Transcript p 542). Later, she said that she did not in fact see any punches being thrown and attributed the error in her statement to the “very traumatic time” in which, and after which, it was made (Transcript p 559-60).
	
	
	She also agreed that in her statement she had said that when she got out of the car “[t]here were arms going everywhere” (Transcript p 542). Later, she agreed that punches were being thrown and that there was a lot of pushing and shoving and yelling and shouting occurring (Transcript p 560-1).
	
	
	She said in cross-examination that the applicant struck Mr Kane on the left side of his temple and that that was where she saw the blood coming from (Transcript p 543). She agreed however that in a re-enactment performed for the police on 19 July 2012 she had shown the blow as landing on the right temple area (Transcript p 545-6). She agreed that Mr Fathers was “swinging” at Mr Kane but said that none of Mr Fathers’ punches connected with him (Transcript p 564).
	


Shaun Fathers


	
	Mr Fathers’ evidence was that he and Mr Kane grabbed each other and “had words” in the carpark that night (Transcript p 585). He said that at some stage Mr Kane ended up on the ground but he did not know how that occurred nor did he do anything to cause that to happen. He said that he threw a couple of punches but declined to say whether any of them landed on Mr Kane (Transcript p 586). Following the grant of a certificate under s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (protecting him from prosecution based on his evidence), he said that he could not recall whether any punch that he threw in fact landed on Mr Kane (Transcript pp 593, 614). He said that Mr Kane punched him causing Mr Fathers’ top lip to split and bleed (Transcript p 593). After this occurred Mr Fathers bent his head down and put his hand to his bleeding mouth. When he looked up, Mr Kane was on the ground (Transcript p 596-7). When Mr Fathers saw the applicant, the applicant was close by, looking at him (Transcript p 598).
	
	
	He agreed that the CCTV footage showed him putting his right arm around the applicant’s shoulder as they walked away from the incident in the carpark but did not agree that the footage appeared to show that as they were doing so he leaned in and “seemed to give [the applicant] a little kiss on the side of the head” (Transcript p 604).
	
	
	Mr Fathers was asked in cross-examination whether he, in response to the question: “yes and then [the] next thing you know you say he’s on the ground”, said to the police:
	


“Yeah it wasn’t from me, I didn’t because what happened was my lip was bleeding because he punched me in the lip, I just went like that, like that, looking like that and next thing I know he’s on the ground” (Transcript p 610).


	
	Mr Fathers said that he could not recall telling the police this but said that that was what had happened.
	


Geoffrey Wallis


	
	Mr Wallis escorted a lady who had won some money at the hotel to her car in the carpark (Transcript p 428). There, he had a confrontation with Mr Frost but was also aware of another group, which included the applicant, having an altercation in the carpark. He said that Mr Fathers was “on the right hand side of Mr Kane in the middle and then the two women were either side of Mr Kane” (Transcript p 433). As he was walking towards the group he did not see any punches thrown or any pushing but then he heard “the noise of the punch which was obviously … a pretty loud noise” (Transcript p 434). He pushed Mr Frost out of the way and went to assist Mr Kane who was on the ground. He did not see the punch, rather, it was its noise that attracted his attention. He said that he probably did see Mr Kane as he was falling onto the ground but was sure that he saw his head hit the ground (Transcript p 435). When he saw Mr Kane falling, Mr Fathers was about a metre and a half away from him and the applicant was slightly further away. Mr Kane hit the ground with his shoulder first and then the left side of his head. He saw a slight cut on the right hand side of Mr Kane’s temple with a trickle of blood oozing from it (Transcript p 437).
	
	
	He agreed that in a statement that he gave to the police he had said that the applicant was standing in front of him to his left and that he saw the applicant move towards Mr Kane prior to Mr Kane falling to the ground (Transcript p 463).
	


Mark Frost


	
	Mr Frost sat on the front passenger seat of the vehicle and spoke through the window in friendly terms to the applicant before he became aware of a commotion at the back of the car. He jumped out and saw Mr Kane on the ground (Transcript pp 501-2). He did not see anyone throw any punches (Transcript p 503).
	


Terry Evans


	
	Mr Evans dined with others at the hotel on the night in question. He was standing in the rear bistro area of the hotel when he heard yelling and shouting coming from the carpark. He could see about five people involved. Of them, he knew Mr Kane and the applicant (Transcript p 251). There was a “bit of pushing and shoving”. He could see Mr Kane with both arms out in front of him with his hands open and fingers extended and he heard him say words to the effect of “I don’t even know you” (Transcript p 251).
	
	
	He started walking towards the group but lost sight of it as he did so. At that time, he heard “a loud thump as though somebody had been hit” (Transcript p 253). When the group came back into sight Mr Kane was on the ground. He recalled that Mr Kane had blood running from the right side of his head at the hairline (Transcript p 256).
	


Colvin Field


	
	Mr Colvin Field is the applicant’s father and lives with the applicant and his family. As he was not able to give oral evidence, his statement to the police was read to the jury and became evidence at the trial.
	
	
	In the statement, Mr Field said that he arrived home between 8.30 and 9.00pm on 15 July 2012 and that the applicant arrived home an hour later and went straight to his bedroom. He continued:
	


“A bit later Craig said to me, ‘Shaun was in a fight down at the pub and the other bloke split Shaun’s lip. I hit him dad and he just hit the deck.’ I said, ‘I’ll go down to the pub and find out what’s going on.’ Craig was obviously worried about what happened to the bloke because he repeated to me that he only hit him once and then the bloke fell back and hit the deck. We spoke about me going to see the police to see what happened and also to go the pub and to try to find out what happened” (Transcript p 259)

Eyewitnesses outside the carpark


	
	Three boys gave evidence of what they observed to have occurred in the carpark on the night in question. The first boy was aged 16 in July 2012, the second was aged 14 and the third aged 16.
	
	
	The three boys had been in a garage across from the hotel when they heard a commotion in the carpark and moved closer to it to see what was happening. They then moved closer again to a point about 20-25 metres from the carpark. The first boy said that at this point he witnessed pushes but not any “full-forced shoves but more scuffles and grabs between, between groups” (Transcript p 196).
	
	
	He turned to say something to one of his friends and as he turned back he “saw one man lunge forward aggressively with his, you know, arm clenched and you know, about to swing a punch” (Transcript p 197). He referred to this person as “the aggressor” (Transcript p 198). He did not see the punch connect because a tree obstructed his view but he heard “a massive, massive thump, like massive, like bone-shattering, you know punch, and then the man in the group on the left hit the ground” (Transcript p 199).
	
	
	The person who threw the punch walked back towards the entrance to the hotel and another man followed him, yelling at him: “[l]ook what you’ve done, you’ve done this, you started this. This is your doing” (Transcript p 200). The following man was to the left of the aggressor and less than a metre behind him (Transcript p 201).
	
	
	In cross-examination the first boy referred to a man, the aggressor, “going forward” and agreed that “one or more people in [the] group were restraining or trying to restrain the man that was going forward.” The following exchange then occurred:
	


“Q.   Are you able to say in what manner the man that was going forward or the aggressor, to use your word, how that person was being restrained?

A.   No.

Q.   When you say ‘no’, I don’t mean this by way of any criticism of you, but could it be that an explanation for that is that your vision was restricted or you may have moved away or your attention might have been diverted?

A.   No. I didn’t see or take notice of how the aggressor was being restrained or – restrained is a bit of a big word, he wasn’t being held back by people he was just, you know, I’ll think about this for a second, get the right words. It was as if the aggressor’s mates were trying to say calm down mate, maybe a hand on the chest and, you know, back off, you know, calm down, possibly. Your Honour, am I making sense?” (Transcript pp 206-207).


	
	The first boy said that the man who threw the punch that immediately preceded Mr Kane falling to the ground was the same man who had earlier been restrained from going forward towards Mr Kane’s group (Transcript p 198). Based on the consistent evidence from other witnesses, this must have been a mistake because it was Mr Fathers who was pushing forward and being restrained and it was the applicant who threw the punch that immediately preceded the applicant’s fall.
	
	
	The mistake was understandable as the first boy took no notice of the clothing or build of the people involved (Transcript p 196) and looked away from the altercation before turning back to see the punch that led to Mr Kane’s collapse being thrown (Transcript p 197). On the evidence of other witnesses, the applicant had suddenly stepped from behind Mr Fathers to throw that punch.
	
	
	The second boy’s evidence was that he saw two males pushing and shoving another male “and trying to amp him up but he refused. He was just trying to leave” (Transcript p 214). The other man kept raising his hands up trying to push the others “like gain distance from them” (Transcript p 215). After he and his friends moved closer, he saw “[m]ore shoving and pushing for a little bit and then after a while one of the guys threw a punch” (Transcript p 216). He said that:
	


“… after a while of the shoving and pushing the man finally gained a fair bit of distance, maybe a metre or two and turned around too – I think he was about to turn around to leave when one of the men stepped forward and threw a punch” (Transcript p 217).


	
	He said that the man threw a punch “[s]omewhere around the back side of his head, maybe around the side too or his back”, somewhere around the ear and the back of the head (Transcript p 218). He could not remember if it was towards the left or the right ear (Transcript p 219). He said that it seemed like the puncher had “thrown a lot of momentum into [the punch], he’d kind of stepped forward and, you know, used his whole body weight to throw a big swing at him.” When the punch landed, the man who was hit “fell or – with the impact of the hit kind of rocketed him towards the ground and he hit the ground pretty hard.” There was a “slight clack from his body hitting the ground, like a little smack on the ground” (Transcript p 219).
	
	
	In cross-examination, the second boy accepted that he had said in his statement to the police that the man who had his hands up in front (with his palms open) was wearing a light blue coloured tee-shirt and that the man who punched him was in a white shirt (Transcript p 226).
	
	
	The third boy’s evidence was that he “saw a girl trying to defend a man and then [he] saw a man step around the woman and hit a man, hit the man” (Transcript p 238). He said that he “saw the punch but [he] just [couldn’t] remember where it came from”. All he could remember was that the hitter wore a white shirt (Transcript p 240-1). He said that the blow was “unexpected out of nowhere” and hit the “side of the head”. He said that he thought the hit was on the left side above the middle of the cheek but said that his memory was “shocking” (Transcript p 241).
	
	
	Ms Lynette Janssen, Ms Maree Hamilton and Ms Hamilton’s daughter gave evidence of their observations from balconies of nearby units. Ms Janssen’s balcony was about 47 metres from the place where the incident occurred, and that of Ms Hamilton about 66 metres (Exhibit E).
	
	
	Ms Janssen saw and heard an altercation in the hotel carpark. She saw a man in a white shirt being restrained. He was facing Ms Janssen and there was a man in front of him in a darker coloured shirt, with his back to Ms Janssen. That person struck the man in the white shirt with his right arm. She said that the punch was to the left side of the face of the other man who “just fell straight to the ground, like just collapsed” (Transcript pp 301-303). She agreed with the proposition that that was “the only blow that you saw thrown” (Transcript p 305).
	
	
	She also agreed that she demonstrated where the blow had landed by indicating to her right side but said that she had done so because she was using her right hand and she was sure that it was the left side of the man that was hit (Transcript pp 307-9).
	
	
	Ms Hamilton said that she had an unobstructed view of the carpark from her unit balcony (Transcript p 266). She said:
	


“When I looked out [through the sliding doors leading on to her balcony] there was a group of between ten, 12, 15 people pushing and shoving, swearing. Then they, some of them moved to my left then two men moved to the right and they continued to argue and that’s when I saw the quick punch” (Transcript p 267).


	
	She later said:
	


“They’re facing each other, they were moving, then they stopped and then in a split second a punch came up over the top of the sign [that obstructed her view of the lower part of their bodies] and just struck the man in the right side of the head and he went down (Transcript p 270).

…

Actually probably the whole event would’ve been in the space of – it just happened so quickly. They moved aside, the two men moved to the right, they had the argument and the next thing there was a punch thrown and it was like wow, what happened? It was just all quick, it all escalated like really quickly” (Transcript p 273).


	
	Ms Hamilton agreed that the lighting was dull: “it was very dull, you could just make out silhouettes” (Transcript p 273).
	
	
	Ms Hamilton’s daughter was about 18 years of age in July 2012. She saw and heard a commotion in the carpark but then went inside from her mother’s balcony for about two minutes. The commotion was still continuing when she returned. She could only see people in silhouette (Transcript p 285). She saw two persons separated from the group and “then before anything [she] just saw a punch and then a man fell to the ground” (Transcript p 287). She said that the punch was thrown with the right hand but she could not say where it landed on the man who fell (Transcript pp 288-9).
	
	
	She agreed that the following evidence she had given on an earlier occasion was correct:
	


“No I did not see two men together, I didn’t, I just saw a group of people together. One punch was thrown, the other man knocked down and then I heard one person laugh and then everyone looked at the guy who was on the ground” (Transcript p 292).


	
	She said it would be incorrect to say that a man walked, or moved, from around a person or that a woman delivered the blow (Transcript p 293). She agreed that the man who delivered the blow was yelling at the other man (Transcript pp 293-4). She did not see anyone being restrained or held back. She agreed that “there was a lot of movement going on involving other people” and that “there were arms going and swinging and pushing and shoving, that sort of thing surrounding the incident involving the blow” (Transcript p 294).
	
	
	In re-examination, she agreed that when she had given evidence on the prior occasion, the following exchange had also occurred:
	


“The two men at the time you saw the punch. I know it’s difficult, I’m not trying to trick you or anything, I’m just wanting to know how far from the nearest group at that point of time were they?”

To which the answer was given:

“About, less than a metre but certainly they were off to one side from the nearest group, yes” (Transcript p 295).

The applicant


	
	The applicant said that he was having a friendly conversation with Mr Frost, who was seated in the car, when he heard a “loud noise.” He followed Ms Grainger to the rear of the vehicle and saw Mr Fathers and Mr Kane “grabbing at each other, like both had each other’s arms” (Transcript pp 724-5). He said that there was more pushing and shoving and “Shaun trying to throw punches [that] weren’t connecting” and that “there was no-one being hit so it was just a pushing, shoving and swearing at this stage” (Transcript p 727). When asked whether Mr Fathers was trying to throw punches, the applicant responded:
	


“He did throw – he did try to throw punches but the gap, the gap between them, it quite often, they got close to each other then they got away from each other, people getting in between them, people grabbing arms and it just – it just got out to a certain point, as I said, in that direction towards the sign and then it started coming back to where they started” (Transcript p 728).


	
	The applicant then said “it just happened so fast and instantaneously that Feathers [Mr Fathers] hit Mr Kane, Mr Kane hit Feathers, the girls went to the right and it was just me and Mr Kane there and I was more or less arrived at the scene of where these two punches were thrown, quickly” (Transcript p 730). When asked whether he saw Mr Fathers’ punch connect with Mr Kane, the applicant said “I just heard it”. It was “[l]ike a thud” (Transcript p 730). Mr Kane then immediately hit Mr Fathers on the face. When Fathers was hit “he went to the right and therefore the girls followed him to the right and it was just, I was in that position where sort of Shaun was before he got hit … I just saw his [Mr Kane’s] hand cocked and I thought he was going to hit me and it was just out of fear I threw a punch to his right head, right side of his head” (Transcript p 731). When the applicant hit him, Mr Kane “just fell straight down” (Transcript p 732). The applicant hit Mr Kane in the temple region above the right eye making him bleed (Transcript pp 733-4) but the applicant could not recall whether or not it was a hard punch.
	
	
	As they were walking away after the incident, Mr Fathers went to put his arm around the applicant but the applicant pushed him away. The applicant agreed that the CCTV footage taken at that time appeared to show Mr Fathers lean in and give the applicant a kiss on the side of the head (Transcript p 745).
	
	
	The applicant said in cross-examination that he had seen Mr Fathers throw a punch but: “didn’t see where it landed. I heard it”. Ms Grainger and Ms Burger were beside Mr Fathers trying to restrain him (Transcript p 760). Later, he said: “you’ve got the two girls holding Shaun and Mr Kane and myself” (Transcript p 761) and that as soon as Mr Kane hit Mr Fathers, Mr Fathers went “that way with the girls and there was just me and Mr Kane directly, the only two that were standing” (Transcript p 764).
	
	
	Immediately prior to Mr Fathers being hit “there was Burger closest to [the applicant] to my right, there was [Mr Fathers] in front of her, Lauren was on her right and Mr Kane was facing all of us” (Transcript pp 767-8).
	
	
	When the applicant returned home, he told his wife that “Shaun was in a fight, he hit the guy, the guy hit Shaun then I hit him and fell straight down” (Transcript p 734). The applicant said that his father may have been present when he had this conversation with his wife (Transcript p 766). Importantly, this recitation included reference to Mr Fathers hitting the man who fell to the ground.
	


The expert evidence

Dr Alan Cala


	
	The Crown called Dr Alan Cala, the senior staff specialist in forensic pathology at the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle, to give expert evidence. Dr Cala conducted Mr Kane’s autopsy.
	
	
	Dr Cala observed three presently relevant injuries. The first was a 12 millimetre diameter abrasion or graze on Mr Kane’s right lower forehead. Dr Cala said that he did not believe that “that injury was in all likelihood caused by a punch”. He thought that a graze was an unusual result of a punch and added that “[w]hilst I couldn’t say it’s impossible I favour some other mechanism such as landing onto some other object, maybe bitumen or the concrete or some other thing that’s rubbed off the skin surface” (Transcript p 649).
	
	
	Secondly, there was a narrow line of interrupted haemorrhage on the inside of Mr Kane’s upper lip, on the left side. Dr Cala said that this had been caused by some external force and continued:
	


“ … [q]uite how it’s come about I’m not able to say. It might have been from a punch, but then we know this man had a lot of medical treatment with tubes being put into his mouth and so on and I would concede that that can sometimes be quite traumatic and might have caused those injuries by that means” (Transcript p 658).


	
	Thirdly, there was a 150 x 90 millimetre area of fresh internal bleeding in the left side of Mr Kane’s neck, around the angle of the left half of the mandible (lower jaw bone) which had spread around various muscles under the skin. This haemorrhage in the left jaw area was the cause of death and consistent with blunt force trauma such as a punch. When asked to comment on the degree of force likely to have caused this subarachnoid haemorrhaging, Dr Cala responded:
	


“I can’t accurately say how much force was applied, but I can say that it would have been more than a mild force or a light force such as being gently touched or slapped. I don’t believe that would cause such an injury. I believe it was more than that. How much more than that I can’t say. It could be a moderate force or it could have been a very severe force and anywhere in between” (Transcript p 665).


	
	Dr Cala also gave the following evidence:
	


“Q.   Could I ask you this doctor, could a person remain upright for a period of time with a bleed that you’ve seen?

A.   Yes.

Q.   How long?

A.   It varies. It could be several seconds and then fall to the ground. It might be longer than that. How long again varies. I don’t believe it would be minutes with this type of injury. I believe it would be much more rapid than that. But my view is that for most of these cases somebody wall fall to the ground within around about 10 seconds as an approximation.

…

Q.   In that time period, and I apologise for not having that note, in that time period would the person be showing any signs, manifestation of this bleeding?

A.   I suspect they would.

Q.   What would they be?

A.   I don’t think that they would look normal as if nothing had happened. I think that they would look dazed, they might appear confused and they may start to complain of symptoms of a terrible headache, feeling sick. And when they’re communicated with by people around them, generally the communication I would not expect to be normal, the conversation would not be as it was prior to that incident. They may be – they may be – they may mumble, they may not say anything, they may be unresponsive verbally.

Q.   What about motor skills, being able to move hands?

A.   They might be able to but again I don’t think they’d look as if nothing had happened, as if – the behaviour they exhibited prior to the incident, I don’t think it would be the same after that incident. To an observer near them or close by they would’ve looked different” (Transcript pp 665-7).


	
	In cross-examination, Dr Cala gave the following further evidence as to the effects of a subarachnoid haemorrhage:
	


“A.   … essentially it’s my view that once a blow had been rendered and a subarachnoid haemorrhage had occurred it was probably, if not instantaneously, after that then very soon after that I would expect that person within several seconds to begin to crumple. As I’ve said I didn’t think – I wouldn’t expect them to look or behave normally, there’s a number of things that they may exhibit to an observer but within several seconds I would then expect them to start falling down to the ground.

Q.   And it’s a matter of degree of course but such a person I think you agreed with me before could remain upright for approximately 10 seconds?

A.   As an approximation they might” (Transcript pp 670-1).

Adjunct Professor John Hilton


	
	The applicant called Adjunct Professor John Hilton, a forensic pathologist of extensive experience, to give expert evidence.
	
	
	Professor Hilton agreed with the reasonableness of the following hypothesis put to him in chief: Mr Kane was struck by a blow on the left jaw which initiated the bleeding process into the arachnoid space, he thereafter remained on his feet, he then “threw a blow” at another person who was being held or restrained in some way and thereafter he received another punch before collapsing (Transcript p 771). Professor Hilton agreed that after receiving the fatal blow (to the left jaw) Mr Kane could have remained upright for 10 seconds or more and maintained a boxing stance, giving the impression that he was about to throw a punch (Transcript p 772) and being capable of doing so (Transcript p 773). He distinguished the consequences of the blow that caused subarachnoid bleeding from a concussion which he said “is literally an instantaneous thing, it’s the sort of thing you see in boxing matches, a boxer gets a punch and he usually crumples immediately after the punch. Now that’s a concussive effect” (Transcript p 775).
	
	
	He added that the above hypothesis:
	


“… is rather uncommon, but I would see a case like this perhaps once every two years, and nowadays with CCTV, assuming that the CCTV is, (a) turned on, and is in the right place we have actually got records now of people being struck and sustaining this sort of injury and performing purposive movements including exiting the location where the blow was sustained outside before crumpling to the ground” (Transcript pp 777-8).


	
	His view was that the abrasion or graze above Mr Kane’s right eyebrow was “consistent with a glancing blow, with [a] punch, [an] elbow, whatever”, delivered with a “trivial amount of force” (Transcript p 780).
	
	
	He considered that the damage under Mr Kane’s lip was consistent with a blow forcing the inside of his lip against his teeth (Transcript p 781).
	
	
	Professor Hilton said that if Mr Kane dropped to the ground immediately after receiving the fatal blow it would not have been as a result of the subarachnoid bleeding “because the bleeding hasn’t had time to take effect if you like but it could well have been caused by a concussive injury” (Transcript p 785).
	
	
	Professor Hilton was asked in cross-examination whether he agreed with Dr Cala’s evidence that if Mr Kane did not immediately lose consciousness as a result of the fatal blow, there would have been a very sudden onset of a severe headache. Professor Hilton gave a long answer but did not appear to disagree (Transcript pp 787-8).
	


Other evidence


	
	There was considerable police evidence concerning the features of the carpark and surrounding area. A large number of photographs were tendered.
	
	
	In addition, there was evidence that the applicant did not suffer any injury to his hands.
	


LEGAL PRINCIPLES

The “unreasonable verdict” ground of appeal


	
	To determine this ground of appeal this Court must make “an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality” (SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [14] citing Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 473). Having done this, the Court must determine whether “upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty” (SKA at [11] citing M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493). If the Court’s review of the evidence leaves it with a reasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt, the accused’s conviction must be quashed unless that doubt is capable of being explained by the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the witnesses (SKA at [13]).
	


Circumstantial evidence


	
	Strictly, the Crown’s case against the applicant was not a circumstantial one as there was considerable direct evidence, including from the applicant himself, that the applicant hit Mr Kane immediately before he collapsed. Moreover, there was eye-witness evidence that supported the Crown’s contention that no-one else landed a punch on Mr Kane that could have caused his death. However, as the Crown sought to prove its case by reference to the combined effect of the evidence of a variety of circumstances, and from a number of different witnesses’ evidence, it is appropriate to refer to the following guiding authority on circumstantial evidence.
	
	
	In R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ observed:
	


“48   Often enough, in a circumstantial case, there will be evidence of matters which, looked at in isolation from other evidence, would yield an inference compatible with the innocence of the accused. But neither at trial, nor on appeal, is a circumstantial case to be considered piecemeal.”


	
	Their Honours then referred to the need to consider “the weight which is to be given to the united force of all the circumstances put together” (ibid, citing Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) [1984] HCA 7; 153 CLR 521 at 535 per Gibb CJ and Mason J).
	


Inconsistencies in the witnesses’ evidence


	
	As the applicant’s case on appeal emphasised inconsistencies in and between the witnesses’ evidence, I refer to the following oft-quoted observations of McHugh J in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 534:
	


“It is the everyday experience of the courts that honest witnesses are frequently in error about the details of events. The more accounts that they are asked to give the greater is the chance that there will be discrepancies about details and even inconsistencies in the various accounts. Of course, it is legitimate to test the honesty or accuracy of a witness’s evidence by analysing the discrepancies and inconsistencies in his or her accounts of an incident. In a case where accuracy of recollection is vital – such as the account of a conversation in a fraud case or the description of a person where identity is the issue – discrepancies and inconsistencies in the witness’s account may make it impossible to accept that person’s evidence, no matter how honest he or she appears to be. But in other cases, discrepancies and inconsistencies may be of far less importance if the honesty of the witness, as opposed to the accuracy of the detail, is the crucial issue. If a jury thinks that the demeanour of the witness or the probability of occurrence of the witness’s general account is persuasive, they may reasonably think that discrepancies or even inconsistencies concerning details are of little moment.”


	
	This passage has been referred to with approval on a number of occasions in this Court including, recently, by Leeming JA (with whom Johnson and Schmidt JJ agreed) in Sio v R [2015] NSWCCA 42 at [40].
	
	
	Conformably with this approach, in BCM v The Queen [2013] HCA 48; 88 ALJR 101, the High Court considered the nature and circumstances of inconsistencies in a complainant’s evidence and concluded that none of them were “of a kind that lead, on a review of the whole of the evidence, to a conclusion that it was not open to the jury to convict” (at [47]).
	
	
	Bearing in mind the presence of Ms Grainger and Ms Burger in the midst of the altercation in the carpark that led to Mr Kane’s death, it is apposite to refer to McClellan CJ at CL’s observation in Mohamed v R [2008] NSWCCA 45 at [18] that “inordinate stress” may give rise to inconsistencies in an account of an event.
	


RESOLUTION OF THE APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION


	
	As the decision in SKA requires, I have conducted an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and quality. As a result of that review, I conclude that the Crown proved its case at trial beyond reasonable doubt and that the jury’s verdict was therefore open to it. In reaching these conclusions I have, consistently with the authorities to which I have referred above (at [71]-[72], [75]), had regard not only to the individual elements of the evidence but also to their cumulative effect. I have also taken into account the fact that “[t]he starting point in the application of s 6(1) [of the Criminal Appeal Act] is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses.” (SKA at [13]).
	
	
	The following matters are of principal importance to my reaching of these conclusions.
	
	
	First, Dr Cala’s and Adjunct Professor Hilton’s expert evidence established that, from a medical point of view, it was possible that Mr Kane suffered the fatal blow before the applicant hit him. That is, assuming that Mr Fathers did in fact punch Mr Kane, Mr Kane may have remained on his feet for a period of about 10 seconds during which he could have punched or attempted to punch Mr Fathers before receiving the applicant’s blow. Moreover, the effect of the evidence, particularly that of Professor Hilton, was that Mr Kane’s internal bleeding would not have caused him to collapse immediately after receiving the fatal blow. However, this evidence was not inconsistent with the applicant’s punch being the fatal blow because Professor Hilton recognised that the concussive effect of a blow to the head may well cause an immediate collapse. There was no evidence to suggest that Mr Kane’s immediate collapse after the applicant hit him did not result from a concussive effect of the applicant’s blow.
	
	
	Secondly, Ms Grainger’s evidence provided strong support for the Crown’s case. When she got out of the vehicle and went around it towards the altercation, she saw Mr Fathers trying to punch Mr Kane. She did not see any of those punches land. It is possible that prior to Mr Fathers and Mr Kane coming into Ms Grainger’s view that one or more of Mr Fathers’ punches connected. However, in light of the period for which the altercation continued after Ms Grainger arrived at it, and the time that the evidence demonstrates must have elapsed before Mr Kane collapsed, it would not be reasonable to conclude, given the medical evidence, that any such earlier punch was the fatal blow. Moreover, no-one suggested that Mr Kane showed any of the symptoms that Dr Cala said he would have expected to be apparent during the period after the fatal blow was delivered (see [58] above).
	
	
	Whilst the altercation was continuing at the rear of the vehicle, Ms Grainger put herself between Mr Fathers and Mr Kane, facing Mr Fathers. Therefore, she would have witnessed any punch that Mr Fathers landed on Mr Kane, yet gave no evidence of this occurring. Her evidence was in fact the opposite, namely that she did not see any further punches, rather, “they were just kind of dancing at each other” (see [8] above).
	
	
	Thirdly, Ms Burger was also in the midst of the altercation and therefore also in a prime position to see any hit by Mr Fathers of Mr Kane. In fact, she said that she “definitely” did not see anyone other than the applicant hit Mr Kane.
	
	
	Fourthly, Mr Fathers’ evidence also provided support for the Crown’s case. As the applicant argued at his trial that the Crown had not proved beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Fathers did not throw the fatal punch, Mr Fathers’ evidence cannot be regarded as objective and disinterested. Nevertheless, even after he was granted a certificate under s 128 of the Evidence Act, he maintained that he did not cause Mr Kane to collapse (see [16] above). He did not rule out the possibility that some of his attempts to punch Mr Kane were successful but his evidence, when taken as a whole, was inconsistent with him landing a punch of any significant force on Mr Kane.
	
	
	Moreover, Mr Fathers’ conduct after Mr Kane’s collapse was consistent with Mr Fathers believing that it was the applicant who had caused Mr Kane’s collapse. The CCTV footage that was in evidence appeared to show Mr Fathers put his right arm around the applicant’s shoulder as they walked away from the incident. Although he did not agree that the footage appeared to also show him lean in and give the applicant a kiss on the side of his head, having viewed the footage, I consider that interpretation is open as is, more generally, the inference that Mr Fathers was comforting or perhaps thanking the applicant for his support during the altercation.
	
	
	This is in contrast to the first boy’s evidence that another man followed the person who threw the punch yelling “[l]ook what you’ve done, you’ve done this, you started this. This is your doing” (see [30] above). Whilst this puts a somewhat different complexion on what occurred as they walked away, it is consistent with Mr Fathers regarding the applicant (who was undoubtedly walking ahead of him) as the prime cause of Mr Kane’s collapse.
	
	
	Fifthly, Mr Wallis’ evidence confirmed the close proximity of Ms Grainger and Ms Burger to Mr Fathers and Mr Kane at the relevant time. He described them as being on either side of Mr Kane. As he approached, he did not see any punches thrown or any pushing but did hear the loud sound of someone being punched. This noise must have been from a punch, rather than Mr Kane falling, as Mr Wallis’ evidence was that he was not looking at Mr Kane when he heard the noise but did so in time to see Mr Kane’s head hit the ground. He did not suggest that he heard any earlier sound of a punch.
	
	
	Sixthly, Mr Colvin Field, the applicant’s father, gave evidence that the applicant told him that he had hit a person (referring to Mr Kane) who had consequently collapsed. Significantly, the applicant did not say that he had only hit that person with a glancing blow which, according to the expert evidence, was the only type of punch consistent with the limited graze or abrasion injury to Mr Kane’s right temple. Specifically, Professor Hilton said that that injury would be consistent with a blow delivered with a “trivial amount of force”. Dr Cala did not believe that that injury was caused by a punch.
	
	
	Moreover, according to his father, the applicant did not tell his father that anyone else had hit Mr Kane. This stands in contrast to the applicant’s version in oral evidence of what he told his wife (which he says may have been overheard by his father), which included a reference to “the guy” (that is, Mr Kane) hitting Mr Fathers (see [53] above).
	
	
	Seventhly, the evidence of the three boys further assisted the Crown’s case notwithstanding that their distance from the incident and the poor lighting requires it to be approached with caution. The first boy saw what was undoubtedly the applicant’s punch as it was immediately followed by Mr Kane collapsing. He did not see any other punches land. His description of the sound of the applicant’s punch as “a massive, massive thump” was also consistent with Mr Wallis’ evidence.
	
	
	The second boy referred to “shoving and pushing” but only to one punch. This was clearly that thrown by the applicant as it was observed to lead to Mr Kane’s immediate collapse. Consistently with the first boy’s evidence, the second boy indicated that it was thrown with considerable force.
	
	
	The third boy likewise saw only one punch. He said it was to the left side above the middle of the cheek.
	
	
	Eighthly, the evidence of the three observers from the unit balconies also supported the Crown’s case, again notwithstanding the limitations on their evidence resulting from distance and lighting. Each only saw one punch and the person punched collapse immediately. There were some differences in their evidence about whether it was Mr Kane’s left or right side that was struck but none of these witnesses suggested that the punch landed on Mr Kane’s mouth (such that it may have caused the lip injury).
	
	
	Ninthly, the applicant described, consistently with the other witnesses, a period of “grabbing” and “pushing and shoving” which involved Mr Fathers throwing punches that did not land. He then said that Mr Fathers hit Mr Kane, Mr Kane hit Mr Fathers and then the applicant hit Mr Kane. The applicant said that he did not see Mr Fathers’ punch connect with Mr Kane, he said that he “just heard it”.
	
	
	Further, the applicant could not recall the force of his punch. If it was in fact a soft punch, or only a glancing blow, it is difficult to understand why the applicant did not include that information in his description of the incident to his wife (and overheard by his father). If it were such a blow, the applicant would likely have been incredulous at Mr Kane’s collapse. The applicant says that his punch landed in Mr Kane’s temple region above the right eye but according to Professor Hilton’s evidence the injury there would have resulted from no more than a trivial blow.
	
	
	The applicant agreed that Mr Fathers put his arm around him as they were walking away from the incident. This action appears to attribute to the applicant, rather than to Mr Fathers, responsibility for Mr Kane collapsing to the ground.
	
	
	The applicant’s evidence confirmed Ms Grainger’s and Ms Burger’s proximity to Mr Fathers and Mr Kane at the relevant time and therefore the likelihood of them seeing any punch by Mr Fathers landing on Mr Kane.
	
	
	Finally, for a number of reasons, it should not be regarded as a reasonable possibility that the applicant’s punch hit Mr Kane on his mouth, causing the lip injury referred to in [56] above. First, the applicant said that he hit Mr Kane elsewhere in the temple region above the right eye (see [49] above). Secondly, none of the eyewitnesses said that Mr Kane was hit in the mouth, most identifying a different place. Thirdly, the medical evidence indicated that the injury may have been caused by medical treatment rather than a punch (see [56] above). Fourthly, common sense suggests that the limited nature of that injury was not consistent with the eyewitness descriptions of the force of the applicant’s punch.
	


Conclusion


	
	There were undoubtedly some inconsistencies in and between the witnesses’ evidence such as what colour clothing Mr Kane’s hitter was observed to be wearing, whether Mr Kane was hit on the left or right side of his head and how Mr Kane fell. However, for the reasons that McHugh J gave in M v The Queen (see [73] above) such inconsistencies are to be expected, particularly in a case such as the present where those observing the altercation from beyond the carpark encountered issues of distance and lighting, and for all witnesses a rapid unfolding of traumatic events. The inconsistencies do not in my view give rise to any doubt about whether it was the applicant’s punch that the witnesses were describing as they all referred to Mr Kane’s immediate collapse after the applicant’s punch. Moreover, the inconsistencies were not such as to detract from the various witnesses’ evidence that they only saw one punch land on Mr Kane.
	
	
	None of the witnesses saw Mr Fathers throw and land a punch on Mr Kane. Ms Grainger and Ms Burger were standing in the immediate proximity of Mr Fathers and Mr Kane, with their attention focused on their interaction. They could not have failed to see Mr Fathers land a forceful punch on Mr Kane, had that occurred. The evidence of the witnesses who were outside the carpark, although not conclusive, if viewed alone also strongly supported the Crown’s case.
	
	
	The jury in this case had the advantage of seeing and hearing all of the witnesses give evidence during a lengthy trial. It was therefore well entitled, as I do, to reject the applicant’s evidence that he heard (though did not see) Mr Fathers land a punch on Mr Kane and to find that the Crown’s case against the applicant was proved beyond reasonable doubt.
	


APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE


	
	For the reasons that R A Hulme J gives, although leave to appeal against sentence should be granted, the appeal should be dismissed.
	


ORDERS


	
	I propose that the Court order that leave to appeal against conviction and sentence be granted but the appeals be dismissed.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the judgments of Macfarlan JA and R A Hulme J.
	
	
	I agree with Macfarlan JA with respect to the application for leave to appeal against conviction. Having undertaken an independent assessment of the evidence, I have no reasonable doubt concerning the guilt of the Applicant of the manslaughter of Mr Kane.
	
	
	I agree with R A Hulme J concerning sentence.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Macfarlan JA.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Macfarlan JA that leave should be granted to appeal against conviction but that the appeal be dismissed. On my reading of the evidence, the conviction of Mr Field for manslaughter was well open to the jury.
	


Application for leave to appeal against sentence


	
	The offence of manslaughter is punishable by imprisonment for 25 years: s 24 Crimes Act. As Macfarlan JA has noted, Fullerton J sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months with effect from 4 July 2014. (The backdating of the sentence was so as to take account of a period of pre-sentence custody.)
	
	
	There is one ground of appeal:
	


""The sentence was manifestly excessive having regard to the protean nature of manslaughter: Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 [226]-[227].""


	
	I take the applicant's case to be that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust because it is based upon erroneous findings of fact and also because certain aspects of his subjective case called for greater mitigation.
	
	
	In relation to challenges on appeal to factual findings, I subscribe to what I would call the orthodox approach, ""the test of asking whether the finding of fact was open to the sentencing judge"": Turnbull v Chief Executive of the Office of Environment and Heritage [2015] NSWCCA 278 at [32] (Button J, Meagher JA agreeing).
	
	
	It must be borne in mind that the judge was able to assess matters of credibility and reliability with the advantage of having seen and heard the witnesses give their evidence. Matters that may bear upon credibility and reliability (for example, whether a witness was confident or hesitant, or gave answers thoughtfully or perhaps too hastily) are denied to this Court when it is confined to the printed pages of the transcript.
	
	
	In relation to the many challenges to the findings of fact by the sentencing judge, it emerged during the hearing of the application that the focus should be on those findings which led to her Honour's conclusion concerning the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	The pertinent passage in the sentencing judgment is as follows:
	


""[83] I am satisfied that the objective seriousness is within the mid range for manslaughter. I do so on the following bases involving factual findings I have reached to the criminal standard:

(1) The offender made the conscious decision to involve himself in a fight with a man not known to him and to deliver a punch to the man's head;

(2) The punch was delivered with at least substantial force;

(3) The offender must have appreciated the risk that he would cause significant injury by the delivery of that punch;

(4) The punch was delivered after Mr Kane had been […] expressing a clear desire that he did not wish to involve himself in violence;

(5)The punch was struck without warning;

(6) The punch was unprovoked by anything the deceased said or did; and

(7) The violence was perpetrated in a carpark open to members of the public and in sight of neighbouring residents and visitors to the area who were attracted to the incident.

[84] Mr Bellanto's submission that the offender's conduct exhibited a low level of objective criminality and moral culpability because the offender suffered a momentary lapse of judgment which was entirely out of character is not persuasive given what I am satisfied was his increasing agitation over the course of the evening. The offender's prior good character will, however, be factored into the sentence to be imposed. Mr Bellanto's submission that a non-custodial penalty is within my sentencing discretion is rejected.""

(1) The offender made the conscious decision to involve himself in a fight with a man not known to him and to deliver a punch to the man's head.


	
	In the course of oral argument, it was conceded that this finding was open to be made but it was submitted it needed to be understood in the context of the applicant's decision to strike Mr Kane being made quickly or spontaneously.
	
	
	It is appropriate to note that the judge accepted a concession made by the Crown that ""the offender may have been drawn into the fight"". She said that ""to the extent that was meant to convey that he was not the instigator, the concession is properly made"". However she added: ""To the extent that the concession is relied upon as a mitigating factor, I do not consider that it has that effect"" (ROS [60]).
	


(2) The punch was delivered with at least substantial force.


	
	In the written submissions, it was contended that her Honour should have found that the force was ""somewhere between slight and moderate"".
	
	
	The evidence of Dr Cala has been set out in the judgment of Macfarlan JA but for convenience I will do so again:
	


""I can’t accurately say how much force was applied, but I can say that it would have been more than a mild force or a light force such as being gently touched or slapped. I don’t believe that would cause such an injury. I believe it was more than that. How much more than that I can’t say. It could be a moderate force or it could have been a very severe force and anywhere in between.""


	
	Professor Hilton was cross-examined by reference to his report as follows:
	


""Q. And you describe that as nevertheless the application of a substantial force remains as the initiating factor, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Can I ask you this, professor, substantial force, that’s a blunt force trauma blow, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. A good blow?

A. A good blow. Or blows.""


	
	The judge also took into account the descriptions of eyewitnesses (e.g. ""a massive thump"").
	
	
	In my view, all of this evidence supported the finding of ""substantial force"". It was a finding well open to her Honour.
	


(3) The offender must have appreciated the risk that he would cause significant injury by the delivery of that punch.


	
	It was a necessary component of the jury's verdict of guilty of manslaughter that it had been established to the criminal standard that a reasonable person in the position of the applicant would have realised that his punch exposed the deceased to a risk of serious injury.
	
	
	In written submissions on sentence it was contended by the applicant that her Honour should find that the applicant did not intend to inflict grievous bodily harm but that there was ""a realisation that in punching the deceased to the left jaw he was exposed to a significant risk of serious injury"". During oral submissions, the judge queried whether this was being conceded on behalf of the applicant.
	
	
	Although that submission (concession) was withdrawn, I am satisfied that the finding was open to her Honour to make. If a reasonable person would have realised the risk of serious injury there is no reason to think that the applicant would not have realised it too. (It is important to note that realising a risk of serious injury is not the same as intending to cause serious injury; the latter being an element of the crime of murder of which the applicant was acquitted.)
	


(4) The punch was delivered after Mr Kane had been … expressing a clear desire that he did not wish to involve himself in violence.


	
	There was a body of evidence supporting this finding. It is referred to in the judgment of Macfarlan JA at [8] (evidence of Ms Grainger), [11] (Ms Burger) and [23] (Mr Evans). Her Honour was ""well satisfied that [Mr Kane] was, if not stationary at the time he was punched, he was moving backwards as if in retreat with his hands up"" (ROS [61].
	
	
	The submission made in respect of this finding was that Mr Kane was attempting to communicate his desire to distance himself from violence to Mr Fathers, not the applicant (27.11.15 at T25.25). That may be accepted but it does not show that the finding was erroneous. This is a particularly significant finding. It is indicative of the aggression, albeit spontaneous, of the applicant towards a man who was clearly presenting no threat to him or anyone else.
	


(5) The punch was struck without warning.


	
	Counsel for the applicant repeated what had been put in relation to conviction; namely that aspect of the applicant's version which has been summarised in the judgment of Macfarlan JA at [49] which included that it was Mr Fathers who delivered the fatal punch. That version was rejected by the jury beyond reasonable doubt; it is not relevant on the question of sentence.
	
	
	Counsel also sought to distinguish this case from ""the sort of case where one sees many times, unfortunately, where there is a victim standing or moving but alone and he is approached and there is gratuitous violence and the person is knocked down"" (27.11.15 at T25.31). That may be accepted (although the point of the distinction is not entirely clear). However, it does not deny the fact that the punch was delivered without any warning to Mr Kane.
	


(6) The punch was unprovoked by anything the deceased said or did.


	
	The point sought to be made in relation to this finding appears to have been that the applicant's punch was delivered in the context of an altercation involving the deceased and Mr Fathers (27.11.15 at T26.10). However, bearing in mind the preceding findings, particular finding number four, this was a finding that was amply supported by the evidence.
	


(7) The violence was perpetrated in a carpark open to members of the public and in sight of neighbouring residents and visitors to the area who were attracted to the incident.


	
	In oral argument it was accepted that this finding could not be challenged (27.11.15 at T26.13).
	


[84]   The applicant's increasing agitation over the course of the evening.


	
	This finding was based upon events that occurred within the hotel earlier in the evening. The areas of the hotel in question were ""the TAB bar"" and ""the smoking area"". The latter was an undercover area out the back of the TAB bar on the way to the carpark. Patrons using it would need to go inside to access the bar or the toilet facilities.
	
	
	Throughout the evening, the applicant, Mr Fathers and others in their group stayed primarily in the TAB bar whilst Mr Kane and Ms Burger occupied the smoking area. During a period of about 1 hour 45 minutes prior to the events in the carpark there was conflict between the two groups but largely involving the applicant's friend, Mr Fathers, and the deceased's friend, Ms Burger. There were the following incidents in chronological order and it is only necessary to describe them briefly:
	


There was a conversation between the applicant and Ms Burger in the TAB bar. She said that he called her a ""smartarse"". He denied this and said it was just general conversation. It was later that he called that name.

About half an hour later there was a heated confrontation between Mr Fathers and Ms Burger in the TAB bar. The applicant stepped between them to break it up. He offered to buy Mr Fathers a drink to calm him down. Ms Burger alleged that Mr Fathers was ""in my face"" and ""was pointing his finger up close to my chin"". A short time later she complained to others that he had grabbed her by the throat. This was not supported by the CCTV footage.

Mr Fathers left the hotel, saying that he had ""had enough"". When the applicant realised Mr Fathers had left he called him to persuade him to return. The content of the conversation was disputed. Mr Fathers did, however, return.


	
	There was a subsequent incident in the smoking area. Those present included the applicant, Ms Burger, Ms Grainger, Mr Frost, Mr Fathers and Mr Kane. The applicant said in his evidence that it was during this incident that he called Ms Burger a ""smartarse"". The judge described the incident in her sentencing remarks as follows:
	


""[41] … [The] CCTV footage showed the offender moving with what I am satisfied is fairly described [as] a display of overt antagonism directed at Mr Kane and Ms Burger towards them pointing and gesticulating in their direction. Although Mr Bellanto submitted that the offender's behaviour was reactive (that is, as I understand it, the conflict between them at that time was not 'inspired, promoted or continued' by him), what I regard as significant is that the stills from the CCTV footage … show Mr Fathers well clear of any engagement with Ms Burger or the others showing every indication that the offender was interceding on his behalf in an attitude of high agitation. Although I am cautious about over-interpreting body language, I am left with the unshifting impression that the offender is not acting at that time to quell the tension but is adding to it.

[42] The CCTV footage shows that the offender's attention is then directed at Mr Frost with whom he has an aggressive face to face encounter before he appears to be restrained by an unidentified onlooker who did not give evidence.""


	
	The CCTV footage her Honour was referring to was played by the Crown at the hearing and I have since replayed it a number of times. Noting the caution her Honour expressed about ""over-interpreting body language"", I can only agree with her Honour's assessment of what the footage reveals. In the context of the preceding events, the description of the applicant's ""increasing agitation over the course of the evening"" was not inapt.
	


Conclusion as to the assertions of fact finding errors


	
	I am not persuaded that any of the challenges to significant facts found by the sentencing judge and upon which she based her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence succeed. There were other challenges to factual findings but they are not significant in the light of this conclusion.
	


Other matters relevant to the assessment of sentence


	
	Her Honour summarised the applicant's personal circumstances. He was aged 39 at the time of the offence. He had no criminal history. He had been married for 17 years and had 4 children from that relationship and 1 from a previous relationship. He left school after Year 10 and then completed an apprenticeship as an electrician.
	
	
	The applicant played professional football for more than a decade until he retired in 2004. He then worked as a hotel manager and football coach in Wagga Wagga until he moved to Kingscliff in 2009. He returned to the electrical trade and took up a position as captain/coach of the Cudgen Rugby League team. He also coached junior cricket and rugby league teams in a voluntary capacity and involved himself in a program to raise funds for various charities.
	
	
	Her Honour found that the applicant had neither expressed remorse nor taken responsibility for causing the death of Mr Kane. Personal deterrence was given ""some weight"" although it was not regarded as a matter of great significance. This was understandable given her Honour's acceptance that the applicant had no prior convictions, was a person of good character, was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation (s 21A(3)(e)-(h) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)). She also had regard to the fact that ""this will be the first time he has served a sentence of imprisonment"".
	
	
	General deterrence, on the other hand, was found to be ""a dominating factor"". Her Honour later added that it was necessary ""to deter others from displays of unprovoked, uncontrolled lethal violence"" and ""to denounce that conduct and provide appropriate punishment"".
	
	
	Her Honour considered a submission that she should find that there were special circumstances warranting a reduction of the proportion of the sentence to be represented by the non-parole period. She concluded that there was no proper basis to do so having regard to the rehabilitation the applicant had achieved already. Matters that were put in support of a submission that her Honour erred in not finding special circumstances were all matters taken into account in the assessment of sentence. It would have been erroneous for there to be double counting of those factors: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18] (Spigelman CJ).
	
	
	The applicant had a favourable subjective case aside from the absence of remorse. There is no complaint that the judge erred by overlooking or failing to take some relevant matter into account in that regard. It is important to bear in mind, however, that it was necessary for her Honour to impose a sentence that appropriately reflected the objective gravity of the offence: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at [15] (Spigelman CJ).
	
	
	The question for determination is whether the sentence imposed by Fullerton J was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]. It is not a question as to whether this Court might have imposed a different sentence: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665.
	
	
	Having regard to all of the circumstances, but particularly the objective seriousness of the offence, the guidepost of the maximum penalty prescribed by Parliament, and the clear need for sentences that will serve the community interest of deterring others from public acts of aggression that may, and in this case did, have tragically fatal consequences, I am not persuaded that the sentence can be characterised as unreasonable or unjust.
	


Conclusion


	
	No error in the manner in which the sentencing discretion was exercised has been established.
	
	
	Although I propose that leave to appeal against sentence should be granted, the appeal should be dismissed.

		23 December 2015",2015-12-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2768606,DPP (NSW) v Sonter [2015] NSWSC 1978,"Judgment


	
	HIDDEN J: The defendant, Brent Sonter, was prosecuted in the Local Court on a charge of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, pursuant to s 52A(3)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. The charge was dismissed. The plaintiff, the Director of Public Prosecutions, appeals against that dismissal, pursuant to s 56(1)(c) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. Conformably with that section, the appeal raises questions of law.
	
	
	The charge was that the defendant in the afternoon of 26 August 2013 at Wongarbon drove a vehicle, a blue coloured Holden Commodore sedan, “when it was involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm to Shayne Popovic, and at the time of impact the said Brent Sonter was driving the vehicle under the influence of a drug, to wit, methylamphetamine.”
	
	
	Put shortly, it was the prosecution case that on the occasion in question the defendant was driving the Commodore on the Mitchell Highway from Dubbo to Wellington. The car crossed the centre line, veered to its incorrect side, and collided with two cars travelling in the opposite direction. Ms Popovic was the driver of the second of those cars, a Mazda, and she suffered serious injuries. About three hours after the collision a sample of the defendant’s blood was taken, and the subsequent analysis of it detected the presence of 0.16 mg/L of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Also put shortly, the defendant’s account to police in a recorded interview, which he maintained in evidence in the Local Court, was that he had used methylamphetamine before he set off on the journey, about 45 minutes before the collision, because he was tired. He believed that his car had veered to the wrong side of the road because he had momentarily gone to sleep. In the Local Court there was no issue about the impact or the resultant grievous bodily harm. The focus was upon whether the prosecution had proved that the defendant was under the influence of the drug at the relevant time and, if so, whether he made out the statutory offence under s 52A(8)(a) of the Crimes Act, that the impact was in no way attributable to the fact that he was under the influence of the drug. Rather, it was said, the accident was the result of his falling asleep despite his belief that it was safe to drive: presumably a reference to the High Court’s analysis in Jiminez v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 572.
	
	
	At this stage it is necessary to set out relevant provisions of the Crimes Act. The provision creating the offence, s 52A(3), is in the following terms:
	


“(3) Dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm

A person is guilty of the offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm if the vehicle driven by the person is involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm to another person and the driver was, at the time of the impact, driving the vehicle:

(a) under the influence of intoxicating liquor or of a drug, or

(b) at a speed dangerous to another person or persons, or

(c) in a manner dangerous to another person or persons.

                                                                                                                  …”


	
	Sections 52AA(3A) and (3B) provide:
	


“(3A) Evidence of intoxication-drugs

For the purposes of section 52A, evidence may be given of the concentration of a drug (other than alcohol) present in the accused’s blood or urine at the time of the impact occasioning death or grievous bodily harm as determined by a blood or urine analysis carried out in accordance with Part 4 of Schedule 3 to the Road Transport Act 2013 .

(3B) Time of intoxication

A concentration of a drug (other than alcohol) determined by the means referred to in subsection (3A) is taken to be the concentration of the drug in the accused’s blood or urine at the time of the impact occasioning death or grievous bodily harm:

(a) if the blood or urine sample that was analysed was taken within 4 hours after the impact, and

(b) unless the accused proves that there was no such drug in the accused’s blood or urine at the time of the impact.”

There was no issue that the blood analysis in the present case was carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Road Transport Act, and that the blood sample was taken within four hours after the impact.


	
	Section 52A(8) provides:
	


“(8) Defences

It is a defence to any charge under this section if the death or grievous bodily harm occasioned by the impact was not in any way attributable (as relevant):

(a) to the fact that the person charged was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or of a drug or a combination of drugs, or

(b) to the speed at which the vehicle was driven, or

(c) to the manner in which the vehicle was driven.”


	
	On the issue whether he was under the influence of methylamphetamine, the defendant told police in an interview that while he was driving prior to the accident he was “feeling ok … not a problem.” He added, “I’ve obviously fallen asleep at the wheel.” Expert evidence was called about the possible effect upon him of the drug, based on his account and the reading obtained by the analyst. For present purposes there is no need to examine it in any detail. It turned in part upon whether he had injected the drug or taken it orally. If he had taken it orally the absorption into the bloodstream would have slower than if he had injected it, and it would have had less of an effect on him at the time of the accident. The magistrate found that he had taken it orally.
	
	
	The expert called in the defence case, Professor Christie, estimated that at the time of the accident the level would have been between .01 and .02 mg/L, a low concentration which he described as “sub therapeutic”. At such a level, he said, an individual might “feel a minor increase in alertness or awakeness but they might not feel anything at all.” He considered that concentration to be consistent with the defendant not having felt any effect of the drug while driving prior to the collision. The expert called in the prosecution case, Mr Farrar, did not accept that the concentration would have been that low. Both experts were of the view that the defendant would have been under the influence of the drug if the concentration at the time of accident was .16mg/L, the concentration found on analysis of the blood sample.
	
	
	The case was conducted on the basis that s 52A(3) creates three offences of dangerous driving, that is, driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug, or at a speed dangerous to another person or persons, or in manner dangerous to another person or persons. The charge was driving whilst under the influence of a drug, and it was accepted that unless that was established the defendant was entitled to be acquitted. His Honour said as much in his reasons for dismissing the charge, although it concerned him because he took the view that a case of driving in a manner dangerous might have been made out on the basis of the defendant’s fatigue.
	
	
	In his reasons for dismissing the charge, his Honour noted s52AA(3B), which he described as “a mechanical provision by which the point at which the blood test if it is within four hours occurs and the level of reading at that time allows the prosecution to rely on that analysis as having been sufficient to prove the level of drug in the blood at the time of driving.” He noted that that “mechanical provision is subject to a defence which is set out in the section.”
	
	
	His Honour set out the terms of s 52A(8)(a) and said, “I interpret that to mean that if you are able to demonstrate as a defence, and it is suggested that that is on the balance of probabilities, that the impact was not in any way attributable to the fact that the person was under the influence of in this case methamphetamine, then that would be a defence to the offence charged.”
	
	
	His Honour went on to refer briefly to the defendant’s police interview and his evidence, and the expert evidence, in particular, Professor Christie’s evidence that the level of the drug at the time of the impact would be sub-therapeutic. His Honour then said, “… I really cannot make a finding that it was at a level where he was in fact under the influence of the drug because of the evidence of Professor Christie, and even on the prosecution case and on the prosecution expert it is not clear on the balance of probabilities that he was in fact influenced if he had taken the drug orally.”
	
	
	His Honour referred to the defendant’s detailed police interview, noting that he had given evidence consistent with it and that the expert evidence was consistent with his having taken the drug orally, as he had said. His Honour continued, “I am of the view that the defence have, on the balance of probabilities, satisfied me that he was not under the influence of the drug at the time of the impact.”
	
	
	His Honour went on to say:
	


“I have to say this is very frustrating because it seems to me that he would otherwise have been guilty of dangerous driving by driving in a manner dangerous to another person but by continuing to drive when he was clearly tired, so tired in fact that he took ice to keep him going, it is a matter of some frustration to me that the matter has been dealt with in this way as a citizen I suppose as much as anything, but it is a matter where I am obliged to acquit him on that defence.”


	
	Before formally pronouncing the acquittal his Honour made it clear that he considered that the wrong charge had been laid. Indeed, before commencing his reasons he said:
	


“I can tell you this, and I don’t mean any disrespect to Mr Sonter who has been very honest, but I am falling over myself to convict him but I can’t, the defence is made out. He has driven while he was tired and he has taken ice because he was tired and then he has had an accident because he was tired. But he is charged with the wrong offence … .”


	
	I have done no more than sketch the course of the Local Court proceedings, and have referred only to a few highlights of what was a considerable body of evidence. However, what I have set out is sufficient to understand the issues raised by the appeal.
	


The appeal


	
	In this Court counsel for the Crown, Mr Pickering SC, argued six grounds of appeal. There is some overlap between them and it is not necessary to deal with each of them separately. The appeal challenges the magistrate’s view that s 52A(3) creates three separate offences, his Honour’s approach to the deeming provision is s 52AA(3B) and the statutory offence in s 52A(8), and generally the adequacy of his Honour’s reasons for dismissing the charge.
	


The deeming provision


	
	The effect of s 52AA(3B) is that the concentration of methylamphetamine found upon analysis of the defendant’s blood sample was taken to be the concentration in his blood at the time of the accident unless he could prove that there was “no such drug” in his blood at that time: par (b).
	
	
	In the Local Court the defendant was represented by Mr Nicholls of counsel, who also appeared in this Court. After the expert evidence, but before the defendant was called to give evidence, Mr Nicholls made what he described as a Prasad submission that, as the evidence stood, his Honour could not be satisfied that the defendant was under the influence of the drug at the time of the accident. His Honour rejected that submission and the hearing proceeded to finality. However, in the course of argument s 52AA(3B) was raised by the prosecutor, who argued that the defendant could not succeed under par (b) because, although the expert evidence conveyed that the concentration in his blood could have been less than that found on analysis, it could not be said that there was no drug at all in his blood at the time of the accident. Mr Nicholls argued that all that need be shown to invoke par (b) was that the level of drug in the defendant’s blood was less than the concentration found on analysis.
	
	
	In the course of discussion it appears that his Honour accepted the prosecutor’s position. However, on the following day he delivered a brief ex tempore judgment on the issue, the import of which, with respect, is not clear. He referred to the terms of the section, describing it as “mechanical.” He referred to a “reverse onus” on the issue “in the sense that there is a defence available under s 52A, once it is demonstrated by the prosecution that there is a level of intoxication within four hours after the time of impact it is for the defence to disprove that there would have been intoxication in effect at the level that is demonstrated at that time.” Whether that was his Honour’s conclusion, or simply a reference to Mr Nicholls’ argument, is not clear.
	
	
	His Honour continued:
	


“That is how I have taken the legislation to read and it is a matter where reading 52AA and 52A in conjunction, I am of the view that because of the defence that is available under 52A that was the intention of Parliament. … there is a logical argument that could be said to exist that such a presumption in relation to intoxication will be discharged at the point of evidence so that the onus was not reversed but I do not (sic) that is the intention of the legislation.""


	
	The reference to a defence “under s 52A” would appear to be the statutory defence under subs (8). It may be that what his Honour intended to convey was that the defendant’s reading at the time of analysis was taken to be his reading at the time of the accident unless he proved that there was no drug at all in his blood at that time, and that, if he could not, there might be a basis upon which he could have recourse to the statutory defence. As will be seen, there appears to be the same ambiguity in his Honour’s reasons for dismissing the charge.
	
	
	On this issue in this Court, Mr Nicholls refined the argument he had mounted in the Local Court. He referred to the second reading speeches in the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council in relation to the Road Transport Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing) Act 2006, which inserted s 52AA(3B) into the Crimes Act. In the Assembly the Parliamentary Secretary said:
	


“The driving skills of motorists with active drugs in their system are affected. Drugs affect a driver’s judgment, concentration, and ability to react quickly and appropriately. Stimulants like speed and ecstasy can also lead to aggressive driving and cause motorists to take risks they would not normally take. … People who have active drugs present in their system should not be driving on our roads.” (Hansard 19.9.06, p 1854)

The same observations, including the reference to “active drugs”, were made by the Minister for Roads in the Council. (Hansard 18.10.06, p 2809)


	
	Mr Nicholls submitted that the words “no such drug” in subs (3B)(b) should be interpreted to mean no such drug “active” in the defendant’s blood at the time of the impact. In the present case, he said, the effect of the evidence of Professor Christie that the concentration in the defendant’s blood at the time of the accident would have been sub-therapeutic, such that he may not have felt any effect of the drug, pointed to the drug not having been active at the time. He argued that the construction of the paragraph for which he contended would prevent a plainly unjust outcome where a defendant with a sub-therapeutic amount of drug in his or her blood at the time of an impact would be subject to a serious punitive provision. He cited authority for the proposition that, in the event of ambiguity or uncertainty, a legislative provision should be interpreted in such a way as to avoid irrational, incongruous or unjust results: Public Transport Commission (NSW) v Murray More (NSW) Pty Ltd (1975) 132 CLR 336, per Gibbs J at 350; DPP v Serratore (1995) 38 NSWLR 137, per Kirby P at 146.
	
	
	I cannot accept that proposition. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the words of the paragraph. “No such drug” is not qualified in any way – certainly not by the adjective “active” – and can only mean no concentration at all of the drug in question. As Mr Pickering pointed out, the expression “concentration of a drug” is used in the opening words of subs (3B) but not in par (b), making it clear that par (b) is concerned not with the concentration of the drug in a person’s blood, but with the presence of the drug at all. Understood in this way, the provision may be seen to have a draconian effect in some cases but it is plainly what it means.
	


Under the influence/statutory defence


	
	It is apparent that the expert evidence, particularly that of Professor Christie, was at the centre of his Honour’s reasons for dismissing the charge. However, with respect, it is unclear how that evidence was linked to the legal issues involved. Those issues were:
	


Was it proved beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was under the influence of methylamphetamine at the time of the accident? If not, he was entitled to be acquitted.

If it was proved that he was under the influence of the drug, was the statutory offence available: that is, had the defendant proved on the balance of probabilities that the accident was in no way attributable to his being so affected?


	
	The issue whether the defendant was under the influence of the drug at the time of impact turned largely, although not entirely, on the expert evidence. There was eye-witness evidence that he appeared to be driving the car normally and safely before it veered to the wrong side of the road. Nevertheless, the expert evidence loomed large on this issue, and it is the only evidence to which his Honour referred in his reasons.
	
	
	That evidence, in turn, was based upon an estimation of the concentration of the drug in the defendant’s blood at the relevant time, having regard to his account of his ingestion of the drug and the reading obtained on analysis of his blood sample. However, by virtue of s 5AA(3B) the concentration was taken to be that reading, .16mg/L, a level at which the experts were in broad agreement that he would have been under the influence of the drug. Nevertheless, that remained a factual matter for his Honour to determine.
	
	
	His Honour raised s 5AA(3B) by his reference to a “mechanical provision”, to which he noted that there was “a defence which is set out in the section.” A little later in his reasons his Honour referred to the statutory defence in s 52A(8). On both defences the burden of proof lay upon the defendant on the balance of probabilities. Despite his reference to s 52AA(3B), his Honour appears to have made a finding about the level of the drug in the defendant’s blood at the time of the accident on the basis of Professor Christie’s evidence, saying that he could not find “that it was at a level where he was in fact under the influence of the drug”, and that it was “not clear on the balance of probabilities that he was in fact influenced if he had taken the drug orally.” Finally, his Honour expressed the view that the defence had “on the balance of probabilities, satisfied me that he was not under the influence of the drug at the time of the impact.”
	
	
	Of course, it was for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was under the influence of the drug at the relevant time, not for the defendant to prove on the balance of probabilities that he was not. His Honour appears to have treated the evidence of Professor Christie as a matter going to a defence on which the defendant bore the onus. Whether that “defence” was the issue raised by s 5AA(3B)(b), that there was “no such drug” in the defendant’s blood at the time of the accident, or whether it was the statutory defence under s 52A(8), is unclear. I incline to the view, which was the view of the parties in argument, that it was the latter.
	
	
	If it was the former, then the defence could not be made out because it had not been established that there was no methylamphetamine at all in the defendant’s blood at the time of the accident. If it was the latter, then that defence fell to be considered only after his Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was under the influence of the drug. The defence would be made out if his Honour were persuaded on the balance of probabilities that the drug played no part at all in the accident: R v Ganderton (CCA unreported, 17 September 1998) per Sully J at p 11. The statutory defence sought to be made out by the defendant, that he simply fell asleep at the wheel, was not addressed in his Honour’s reasons. The only reference his Honour made to it was his observation that it might have provided the foundation for a different charge.
	
	
	Of course, due allowance must be made for the pressure under which magistrates work, and the fact that his Honour’s reasons were given ex tempore and that the record I have of them is unedited and, in large part, unpunctuated: Director of Public Prosecutions v Illawarra Cash Mart Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 343, 67 NSWLR 402 at [15] (407), a decision of Johnson J. Nevertheless, it is clear that his Honour failed properly to address the issues raised by the matter and that this Court’s intervention is called for.
	


One offence?


	
	This leaves the question whether his Honour’s view that s 52A(3) creates three offences is erroneous. Mr Pickering submitted that the subsection creates one offence of dangerous driving (occasioning grievous bodily harm) constituted by any one or more of the paragraphs set out: driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug, or at a speed or in a manner dangerous to another or others. If this be so, it would be appropriate in the one charge to allege more than one of those paragraphs, in effect, as particulars.
	
	
	The issue was raised, but not decided, in R v Lykouras [2005] NSWCCA 8. That was an application for leave to appeal under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against an order of a District Court judge allowing the Crown to add to an indictment containing one count under s 52A(3) alleging driving under the influence of a drug a further count of driving in a manner dangerous. The appeal against that order was dismissed.
	
	
	However, relevant for present purposes are the following passages from the judgment of Howie J (with whom Sully J and I agreed) at [14] ff:
	


“14   During the hearing of the application, the question was raised from the Bench whether s 52A(3) created one offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, the matters appearing in (a) to (c) of the section being merely alternative ways of proving that particular offence, or created three offences, one offence being prescribed by each of (a), (b) and (c). Neither of the parties had raised this issue before Judge Gibb nor in their written submissions before this Court. The arguments of the parties seemed to have been premised upon the fact that the two charges in the indictment were for distinct and separate offences, albeit arising out of the same factual circumstances.

15   The parties asked for, and were granted, leave to make further written submissions on this issue after the Court reserved its decision. In those further submissions the Crown argued that the section created only one offence and that the alternative counts that the Crown sought to prosecute in the amended indictment were merely different ways of proving the same offence. Mr Doris argued that, whether or not there is only one offence created by the section, proper practice demanded that the Crown stipulate the specific manner in which it says that an offence in breach of the section was committed. He argued that, where the Crown is alleging that the offence was committed in more than one way, it should lay separate charges, each alleging a particular manner in which the offence was committed. In that regard he relied upon Beach (1994) 75 A Crim R 447 at 453.

16   In the present matter it is unnecessary to resolve the issue of whether a single offence is, or multiple offences are, created by the section. The Crown clearly has taken the view that it should lay individual charges for each alleged breach of the section arising from the facts surrounding the particular act of driving, and, if there is more than one, laying the charges in the alternative. There seems to me on reflection to be a real benefit in the Crown following that course: it both informs the accused and the court of the particular allegation made against the accused in each charge and it assists the court in understanding the basis upon which the jury found the accused guilty of a charge on the indictment, if a guilty verdict is returned to one or other of the counts.”


	
	In Lykouras it was argued on behalf of the applicant that there would be unfairness in adding the additional count, given that there was a prospect of acquittal of the original count because there was a basis for challenging the admissibility of a blood sample taken from the applicant and its subsequent analysis. This led to further observations by Howie J at [21] ff:
	


“21   A substantial part of the applicant’s argument in this regard seems to me to be based upon an asserted right to seek to have the charge dismissed upon a technicality without the Crown frustrating that right by laying a charge that may have to be determined on its merits. In my view there is no such right. …

                                                                                                                 …

23   There is, of course, a rule of practice that precludes the Crown from raising an alternative count late in a criminal trial. But this rule is concerned with ensuring a fair trial and not with limiting the manner in which the Crown can proceed against an accused. The most recent discussion of this constraint upon the Crown’s right to conduct the prosecution as it chooses is found in R v Gulliford [2004] NSWCCA 338. In that case the trial judge formulated an alternative verdict during the defence case. The Crown had not opened to the jury on the availability of such a verdict and it goes without saying that the alternative count was not set out in the indictment. Nevertheless the alternative was left to the jury on the basis that it was capable of being proved by the evidence and the jury might not have been satisfied of all of the elements that made up the principal offence charged in the indictment.

24   In upholding the conviction on the alternative count Wood CJ at CL, with whom the other members of the Court agreed on this point, stated:

91   While it is generally inadvisable for a trial judge to raise an alternative count, which has not been suggested by trial counsel, R v Pureau (1990) 19 NSWLR 372 and R v Cameron [1983] 2 NSWLR 66 at 71, it is not forbidden. Much will depend upon the timing, whether counsel have had a proper opportunity to deal with it, and whether the defence has been prejudiced, for example in the way that the case was conducted: R v Quinn (1991) 55 A Crim R 435.

It was clear in Gulliford that the appellant had suffered no prejudice by the addition of the alternative count and, therefore, there was no miscarriage of justice by it being raised so late in the proceedings.

25   The point is that both the trial judge and this Court are concerned with ensuring a fair trial to the accused and not with some broader concept of unfairness to restrict the Crown in its conduct of the prosecution as might be expected in a sporting contest. I know of no occasion where a Court has refused to allow the Crown to rely upon an alternative count or an alternative way of proving the offence charged simply because to do so might deprive the accused of the chance of a complete acquittal. I do not believe that a court has such a power.”


	
	The question whether s 52A(3) creates a single offence with alternative particulars or multiple offences was referred to, but again left undecided, in R v Tzanis [2005] NSWCCA 274, per Spigelman CJ at [23].
	
	
	In my view, there is considerable force in Mr Pickering’s argument that the subsection creates a single offence. However, yet again, the present case does not require that issue to be decided. Should this appeal be successful, the order sought by the Director is that the matter be remitted to the Local Court for redetermination. This ground of appeal is directed to the question whether, upon remitter, it would be open to the Court to consider the charge on the alternative basis of driving in the manner dangerous in the light of the defendant’s fatigue. However, I would not permit the matter to be remitted on that basis. I accept Mr Nicholls’ submission that that course would involve an unacceptable element of double jeopardy.
	
	
	In Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald  [2004] NSWSC 182, also an appeal by the Director against the dismissal of a charge in the Local Court, Sully J had occasion to consider whether this Court has a discretion to refuse relief on the basis of double jeopardy. The power to remit arises from s 59(2)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, by which this Court may set aside the order made in the Local Court and make “such other order as it thinks just.” I propose not to refuse relief, but to grant it on terms.
	
	
	His Honour arrived at no concluded view on the issue, but said at [35] - [36):
	


“35   Insofar as I have been persuaded that the learned Magistrate did make an error of law apt to vitiate her Worship’s order, I accept at once that no fault in that connection can be laid at the feet of Mr Wunderwald. I accept as of course that it is only to be expected that he will be certainly disappointed, and probably indignant, to think that the order dismissing the information laid against him is defective in law, and that there opens up before him the prospect of a rehearing in the Local Court.

36   As to all of those considerations, I would say this: I am not persuaded that the words ‘may determine’ which appear in section 59(2) of the Appeal and Review Act do confer an overriding discretion of the kind to which the submissions of learned counsel for the first defendant refer. It is, however, unnecessary to determine finally that point, because even if I were persuaded that the statutory expression carried with it such an overriding discretion, I would not think it right to exercise such a discretion adversely to the plaintiff in the present proceedings.”


	
	Wunderwald, however, was a very different case from the present. It was a simple case in which the dismissal of a charge of offensive behaviour was set aside because of error of law and denial of procedural fairness to the prosecution by the magistrate. The remitter of the matter to a Local Court did not provide any opportunity for the prosecution to recast its case. Here, as I have said, the matter proceeded on the basis of the allegation charged, that is, that the defendant was under the influence of a drug. There was no application by the prosecution to widen its case by amendment of the charge or any other means, nor did the magistrate raise the matter and invite submissions as to whether such a course should be followed.
	
	
	This is not a case, such as Lykouras, where the defendant seeks to rely upon a technicality to prevent the prosecution case being determined on its merits. A significant question of fairness arises here, invoking the discretion conferred by s 59 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. In my view, it would be unjust to allow the prosecution to present a case against the defendant different from that to which it adhered from the beginning to the end of the Local Court proceedings. I propose not to refuse relief, but to grant it on terms.
	


Orders


	
	Mr Pickering argued that, if the matter were to be remitted to the Local Court, I should direct that it be heard by another magistrate. I am mindful of the fact that this discretion is not lightly to be exercised. In Wunderwald Sully J refused to do so, saying that he did not “think that it is appropriate for the Supreme Court to intrude so far into the affairs of the Local Court to make such an order”: [41]. His Honour saw the re-listing of the matter in the Local Court as the responsibility of the Chief Magistrate or his delegate, not for a judge of this Court.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the order has been made in appropriate cases. Mr Pickering acknowledged that the power to make such an order should be used sparingly and with caution, only where there is a reasonable likelihood of a perception of pre-judgment or where it is otherwise desirable in the interests of justice, citing Castle Constructions Pty Ltd v North Sydney Council [2007] NSWCA 164 at [66] – [85] and [124] – [142]. In the present case his Honour did express a firm view about the likely outcome if what he saw as the appropriate charge had been laid. However, the limited basis upon which I propose to remit the matter will mean that that issue does not arise, and there is no reason to doubt that his Honour would assess the statutory defence appropriately in the light of the evidence.
	
	
	Accordingly, the order of the magistrate dismissing the charge against the defendant of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm is set aside. The matter is remitted to the Local Court for re-determination, confined to the allegation that the defendant was driving under the influence of methylamphetamine. The Director does not seek costs.

2768622,State of New South Wales v Kamm (Final) [2016] NSWSC 1,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: By its amended summons filed on 1 October 2015, the State of New South Wales seeks final orders pursuant to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006. Mr Kamm is currently on parole. Any decision about these orders must be made before 12 January 2016.
	


Background


	
	Mr Kamm is a 65 year old male with a history of sexual offending against under-age females. He established a religious community at Cambewarra, near Nowra, which became known as “The Order of Saint Charbel”. Mr Kamm claimed to have received visions or visitations from the Virgin Mary.
	
	
	Mr Kamm was and is known as the “Little Pebble”. He described himself as a visionary who had been told by God or the Virgin Mary that he was to be the last Pope. He claimed to be able to communicate regularly with the Virgin Mary, and would write down what she said and pass these messages on to followers. Mr Kamm also prophesied that there would be a new holy era when he would have 12 queens and 72 princesses, who would assist in bringing forth his children in an immaculate race. The 12 queens and 72 princesses would be chosen by the Virgin Mary. The 12 queens would bear his children. The 72 princesses would be able to marry others but would also bear his children if they wished. The children produced by the queens and princesses would be the product of Mr Kamm's ""mystical seed"".
	
	
	In 2005 Mr Kamm described the Order as extending to many countries and having over 500,000 devotees, who either reside in communities or are auxiliary members.
	
	
	At the commencement of these proceedings, Mr Kamm was serving a sentence of imprisonment following his conviction in 2007 for five counts of sexual intercourse with a child above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years, in circumstances of aggravation, contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, and a further count of committing an act of indecency towards the victim, again in circumstances of aggravation under s 66O(1). The aggravating circumstance was that the victim was under Mr Kamm’s authority at the time. He committed the offences in 1994 and 1995. The victim was then aged 14 or 15 years old. Mr Kamm was sentenced to a total effective sentence of 10 years' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 7½ years.
	
	
	In 2005 Mr Kamm was also convicted of sexual offences against another under-age girl (who was 15 years of age) on one count of aggravated sexual intercourse under s 66C(2), and four counts of aggravated indecent assault under s 61M(1). Mr Kamm committed the offences in 1993. He was sentenced to a total effective sentence of 5½ years' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 3½ years
	
	
	Each victim had resided in Mr Kamm’s religious community at Cambewarra.
	
	
	While in custody, Mr Kamm undertook the Custody-Based Intensive Treatment (CUBIT) program for sex offenders with incomplete success: he is identified as having continuing treatment needs. He was released on parole on 14 November 2014. Since then, Mr Kamm has resided with his partner, who he married in December 2014, at a unit in Sydney. Mr Kamm’s sentence of imprisonment expired on 13 October 2015.
	
	
	In a recent psychiatric report, Dr Andrew Ellis assessed Mr Kamm as having a paraphilic disorder (provisional) centred upon deviant sexual arousal. Dr Ellis described the disorder as being a chronic, relapsing condition that is resistant to treatment and rehabilitative efforts. Mr Kamm is also identified as having a co-morbid Narcissistic Personality Disorder, which has an impact upon on his treatment and supervision response. In a psychological risk assessment report dated 7 September 2015, Dr Christopher Lennings opined that ""there is a high likelihood of further serious sexual offending should Mr Kamm be released into the community without supervision.""
	
	
	Mr Kamm continues to present himself as the “Little Pebble” and to preach his unorthodox religious views via the Littlepebble.org website. He says he continues to receive visions. He also continues to have contact with members of his religious order, and states that he receives gifts from his followers. In August 2015 Mr Kamm told a supervising officer that the Order of Saint Charbel now has 50,000 followers who meet every week in prayer groups all over the world.
	
	
	On 13 October 2015 R S Hulme J made an order under s 7(4) of the Act appointing Dr Jeremy O'Dea, psychiatrist, and Mr Patrick Sheehan, psychologist, to conduct separate examinations of Mr Kamm and prepare expert reports for the Court: State of New South Wales v Kamm [2015] NSWSC 1492. His Honour also made an interim supervision order under s 10A of the Act, to commence from 13 October 2015.
	
	
	On 6 November 2015 Schmidt J made an order under s 10C(2) of the Act renewing the interim supervision order until 5 December 2015. On 2 December 2015 Adamson J made an order further renewing the interim supervision order until 6:00pm on 15 December 2015. I ordered at the final hearing that, pending my decision, the interim supervision order be further renewed until 12 January 2016.
	


Evidence


	
	In support of the present application, the State relies upon the following affidavits:
	



	
	Two affidavits of Brett Thomson sworn 21 September 2015, one sworn 28 September 2015 and one sworn 25 November 2015.
	
	
	An affidavit of Paul Yeoman affirmed 28 September 2015.
	
	
	An affidavit of Ellen McCarroll affirmed 30 September 2015.
	



	
	Exhibited to the second affidavit of Mr Thomson are four folders of tabulated documents entitled ""Exhibit BT-1"", comprising the State’s tender bundle in these proceedings.
	
	
	In addition, the State relies upon the reports of the two court-appointed experts. Dr O'Dea’s report is dated 3 December 2015. Mr Sheehan’s report is dated 15 November 2015.
	


Threshold requirements


	
	The Act sets out certain threshold criteria for the making of an application for an extended supervision order (“ESO”) under the Act: s 5I. The State may apply to the Supreme Court for an ESO for a high risk sex offender only where:
	


(1)   At the time of the filing of the application the offender is a supervised sex offender, meaning a sex offender serving a sentence of imprisonment - which is taken to include the serving of a sentence of imprisonment while the offender is on release on parole (s 5I(3)) - for ""a serious sex offence"" or ""an offence of a sexual nature"" or for another offence which is being served concurrently and/or consecutively with a sentence of imprisonment for such an offence: s 5I(1)-(2).

(2)   The offender in respect of whom the application is brought is a ""sex offender"".

(3)   The application is brought within the last 6 months of the offender's current custody or supervision: s 6(2).


	
	The expression ""serious sex offence"" is defined by s 5(1) of the Act to include an offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act where, in the case of an offence against an adult or a child, the offence is punishable by imprisonment for 7 years or more.
	
	
	At the time of the commencement of these proceedings, Mr Kamm was serving two concurrent sentences of imprisonment for the offence of sexual intercourse with a child above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years, in circumstances of aggravation, contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act, being an offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act. At the relevant time, the offence carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The offence therefore qualifies as a ""serious sex offence"" within the meaning of ss 5(1) and 6 of the Act.
	
	
	The offence also qualifies as an ""offence of a sexual nature"". In this respect, s 5(2)(a) of the Act defines an ""offence of a sexual nature"" to include an offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	Further, Mr Kamm is a ""sex offender"" as defined in s 4 of the Act, and referred to in s 5I, because he is a person over the age of 18 years who has been sentenced to imprisonment following his conviction for a serious sex offence.
	
	
	Mr Kamm’s sentence for the offences of sexual intercourse with a child above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years expired on 13 October 2015. The application for an ESO was filed before that date, and within the six month period permitted by the Act.
	


Relevant statutory provisions and applicable principles


	
	The primary object of this Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of high risk sex offenders and high risk violent offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community. Another object of this Act is to encourage high risk sex offenders and high risk violent offenders to undertake rehabilitation.
	
	
	Subsection 5C(1) provides that on an application being made under the Act, the Supreme Court may make an order for the supervision of an offender if the offender is a ""high risk sex offender"". Subsection 5B(2) provides that an offender is a ""high risk sex offender"" if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.
	
	
	Section 9 applies to an application for an ESO. Under s 9(1) a court that has received an application for an ESO has two options available to it: either to make an extended supervision order or to dismiss the application. Subsection 9(3) sets out a list of matters to which the Court must have regard in determining whether or not to make an ESO in addition to any other matter the court considers relevant.
	


""Satisfied to a high degree of probability"": s 5B(2)


	
	The phrase ""satisfied to a high degree of probability"" constitutes the statutory standard of proof enlivening the Court's jurisdiction to grant an ESO. It is higher than the civil standard but lower than the criminal standard. Prior to the commencement of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Amendment Act 2013, the phrase ""satisfied to a high degree of probability"" appeared in s 9(2), as part of the test to be met for the grant of an ESO under s 9(1)(a).
	
	
	In State of New South Wales v Fisk [2013] NSWSC 364 Beech-Jones J observed at [22] that the structure of the Act in its current form (which now accommodates the making of orders against high risk violent offenders as well as high risk sex offenders) appears to require that the Court first undertake a determination of whether a person falls within the definition of a “high risk sex offender” (under s 5B(2)) having regard to the relevant standard prior to considering whether or not to make an ESO, and that it is only once the Court has made a determination that a person is a high risk sex offender that the criteria in s 9(3) are to be addressed.
	


""Unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence"": s 5B(2)


	
	The phrase ""unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence"" was introduced into s 9(2) of the Act by the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Amendment Act 2010, which commenced operation on 7 December 2010. It replaced the concept of ""likely to commit a further serious sex offence"". When the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Amendment Act 2013 was introduced on 19 March 2013 to establish a scheme for the extended supervision or continued detention of violent offenders, the phrase was relocated to s 5B(2) of the Act.
	
	
	Subsection 5B(3) makes clear, as did the former s 9(2A), that the Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is ""more likely than not"" in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk if he or she is not kept under supervision. The phrase ""unacceptable risk"" is not defined by the Act. However, as s 5B(3) makes clear, the new test was not intended to elevate the threshold test to be satisfied.
	
	
	In State of New South Wales v Thomas (Preliminary) [2011] NSWSC 118 at [22], R A Hulme J proceeded on a consensual basis that the new formulation does not impose a more stringent test than that which it replaced. At [20], his Honour expressed a tentative view that the test in (the former) s 9(2) was ""satisfied if there is a risk that the person will commit a serious sex offence which is present to a sufficient degree so that the safety and protection of the community cannot be ensured unless an order is made.""
	
	
	In State of New South Wales v Darrego [2011] NSWSC 360 at [5], McCallum J expressed concern that such a formulation puts a gloss on the precise words of the section: ""The test in s 9(2) turns on the Court's assessment of the risk posed by the offender of committing a serious sex offence if unsupervised and the Court's judgment as to whether that is an unacceptable risk.” Without expressing a concluded view her Honour said at [11]:
	


“[11] It may be preferable not to dilate upon the circumstances that would satisfy the statutory test even in terms that mirror the language adopted in the statement of the objects of the Act. The task for the Court is to form a judgment after considering the relevant risk as to whether that risk is unacceptable.”


	
	Her Honour also suggested at [9]-[10] that the Court's approach on the matter might usefully be informed by cases in relation to medical negligence and the concept of material risk.
	
	
	In State of New South Wales v Conway [2011] NSWSC 588, Simpson J at [30], without expressing a final view on the issue, stated a preference for the approach taken by R A Hulme J in Thomas. Ultimately, in the final hearing in Thomas [2011] NSWSC 307 at [58], R A Hulme J, in ordering that the defendant be subject to an extended supervision order, gave the words in s 9(2) their ordinary meaning, in the context in which they appeared and having regard to the objects of the Act.
	
	
	In State of New South Wales v Richardson (No. 2) [2011] NSWSC 276, Davies J referred to two decisions of the Western Australian Court of Appeal dealing with the cognate legislation in that State. In Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v Williams [2007] WASCA 206; (2007) 176 A Crim R 110, Wheeler JA said at [63]:
	


“[63] In my view, an 'unacceptable risk' in the context of s 7(1) is a risk which is unacceptable having regard to a variety of considerations which may include the likelihood of the person offending, the type of sexual offence which the person is likely to commit (if that can be predicted) and the consequences of making a finding that an unacceptable risk exists. That is, the judge is required to consider whether, having regard to the likelihood of the person offending and the offence likely to be committed, the risk of that offending is so unacceptable that, notwithstanding that the person has already been punished for whatever offence they may have actually committed, it is necessary in the interests of the community to ensure that the person is subject to further control or detention.”


	
	Davies J also referred to the approach adopted by Steytler P and Buss JA in Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v GTR [2008] WASCA 187; (2008) 198 A Crim R 149 at [27]:
	


“[27] The word 'unacceptable' necessarily connotes a balancing exercise, requiring the court to have regard, amongst other things, for (sic) the nature of the risk (the commission of a serious sexual offence, with serious consequences for the victim) and the likelihood of the risk coming to fruition, on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the offender, on the other, if an order is made (either detention, without having committed an unpunished offence, or being required to undergo what might be an onerous supervision order). As John Fogarty points out, albeit in a rather different context (Unacceptable risk - A return to basics (2006) 20 AJFL 249, 252), the advantage of the phrase 'unacceptable risk' is that 'it is calibrated to the nature and degree of the risk, so that it can be adapted to the particular case’.”


	
	In applying the s 9(2) test, Davies J said at [90]:
	


“[90] Two things seem to me significant when assessing the evidence and the likelihood of re-offending. The first is the higher standard of proof imposed by the words ‘a high degree of probability’. The second is the notion that ‘unacceptable risk’ involves a balancing exercise between the commission of a serious sexual offence and the likelihood of that risk coming to fruition on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the Defendant either because he will be detained beyond the period of his sentence although he has not committed any further offence or he will be subject to an onerous supervision order, on the other hand. It is because of that balancing exercise that it is open to the Court to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that there is an unacceptable risk but that the result of that finding (either a continuing detention order or a supervision order) may vary in a given situation. That is also because s 17(3) provides for the further assessment that if the Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk a supervision order will not be adequate to meet the risk.”


	
	Davies J concluded that the defendant in that case posed an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence even though he had committed only one (albeit a very violent) sexual offence.
	
	
	In State of New South Wales v Cruse [2013] NSWSC 1733 Davies J adopted the same approach to the meaning of unacceptable risk in s 5B(2) of the Act as he had taken in Richardson in respect of the former s 9(2), observing at [8] – [12] that the ""learning which had developed in relation to s 9(2) is equally applicable under the amended form of the Act.”
	
	
	In Attorney General of New South Wales v McGuire [2015] NSWSC 152 Hoeben CJ at CL conducted the preliminary hearing in an application under Schedule 1 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 for the extension of the defendant's status as a forensic patient. In that context, his Honour considered comparable wording in the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act, including the phrase ""unacceptable risk"". His Honour noted what he described as a ""difference of opinion"" that had emerged in first instance decisions in New South Wales under the 2006 Act. His Honour contrasted the approach taken by RA Hulme J in Thomas - to the effect that the words “unacceptable risk” ought to be given their everyday meaning in the context of the provision in which they appear and having regard to the objects of the Act - with the ""balancing exercise"" approach taken by Davies J in Richardson (No 2). Hoeben CJ at CL said at [44]:
	


“[44] There are thus two approaches which have been taken at first instance decisions in NSW as to what factors the Court ought to have regard to in considering what will constitute an 'unacceptable risk'. The issue as to which of these approaches is correct remains to be resolved. I am of the opinion that the preferable approach is that adopted by R A Hulme J and I propose to apply it in this case.”


	
	In State of New South Wales v Mackey (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1153 at [26]-[27], Schmidt J agreed with Hoeben CJ at CL in McGuire endorsing the approach taken in Thomas.
	
	
	In the present case the State emphasised a series of propositions concerning the jurisprudence on the ""unacceptable risk"" test and the requirements of that test as it appears in s 5B, read in the context of the Act as a whole.
	
	
	First, it is preferable to avoid putting a gloss on the words of the statute which require the Court to consider matters such as the nature and likelihood of the relevant risk and form a judgment, based on the evidence, as to whether Mr Kamm poses an unacceptable risk of committing a further serious sex offence. The determination of what is an unacceptable risk may require consideration of various factors (such as the perceived likelihood of recidivism and the type and nature of offences that may be committed absent supervision), and may entail a balancing of factors in cases where they might point towards differing outcomes (such as a low risk of recidivism versus likely drastic consequences to the victim if an offence occurs). Clearly, any analysis of the concept of unacceptable risk involves recognition that there will be a range of factors affecting risk and some cases that are more obvious examples of unacceptability than others.
	
	
	Secondly, while it appears that the Court is not required to consider all of the factors listed in s 9(3) in determining whether or not it is satisfied under s 5B(2) to a high degree of probability that a person poses an unacceptable risk of offending (as it must when determining, under s 9, whether or not to make an ESO order at all), those factors should nevertheless inform the s 5B(2) analysis: see Fisk at [22].
	
	
	Thirdly, it is important to recall, having regard to s 5B(3), that the Supreme Court may legitimately find in some situations that a person poses an unacceptable risk for the purposes of the statutory test even if the likelihood of them committing a further serious sex offence is determined to be low.
	
	
	Finally, while it is necessary to bear in mind the limitations of attempting to draw comparisons with the factual circumstances of other cases, in State of New South Wales v McQuilton [2014] NSWSC 11, R A Hulme J imposed an ESO in respect of a sexual offender who had experienced pervasive rape fantasies, but had only been convicted of a single serious sex offence.
	
	
	Decision-making about unacceptable risk is highly fact-dependent but takes place at least in the context of ensuring community safety and protection.
	


Discretion not to make an ESO


	
	Under the Act, if the State discharges its burden to establish that the offender is a high risk sex offender under s 5B, the Court still has a discretion whether or not to make an order, and must take into account the criteria in s 9(3). However, where a court is satisfied according to the relevant standard that the offender is a high risk sex offender, it would be an unusual case before the court would decide in its discretion not to make an ESO under s 9.
	
	
	In the present case, the State submitted that there were no strong discretionary considerations against the making of such an order in the event that Mr Kamm is found to be a high risk sex offender.
	


The s 9 factors relating to Mr Kamm


	
	As noted above, in considering whether an offender is a high risk sex offender for the purposes of s 5B, regard may be had to the relevant factors listed in s 9(3). Those factors may bear upon both the threshold state of satisfaction as to whether Mr Kamm is a high risk sex offender who may be subject to an ESO under ss 5B and 5C of the Act and the exercise of the discretion to make an ESO under s 9.
	


Mr Kamm’s offending history: s 9(3)(h)


	
	On 24 August 2007 Berman DCJ sentenced Mr Kamm following a trial with a jury in respect of six sexual offences relating to the one victim.
	
	
	The factual circumstances relating to the offences are set out in his Honour’s remarks on sentence and also in the judgment of Court of Criminal Appeal. Judge Berman described Mr Kamm as “the head of a religious organisation with many, many followers throughout the world.”
	
	
	The six counts charged related to conduct engaged in by Mr Kamm in 1994 and 1995, and included penile-vaginal intercourse and digital-vaginal intercourse. The offences took place at a motel and at least one other location. The victim cried out in pain. At the time of the offences charged, the victim was 14 or 15 years old.
	
	
	In the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kamm v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 290 Giles JA said:
	


“[3] The appellant [Kamm] was the leader of a religious community known as the Order of St Charbel. Members of the community lived in houses and caravans on a property near Nowra in New South Wales. The appellant was known as The Little Pebble. He claimed to communicate with and receive messages from the Virgin Mary. He prophesied the end of the world and a new era of paradise on earth for the community, and his teachings included that 12 queens would be chosen by the Virgin Mary to bear his children and 72 princesses would be chosen able to marry others but to bear his children if they wished. All would become the appellant's wives and the child-bearing would provide the foundation for repopulation in the new era.”


	
	In his sentencing remarks, Judge Berman described Mr Kamm, the religious community he established, and his connection with the victim as follows:
	


[2] The offender is the leader of a religious order based around a community at Cambewarra near Nowra on the South Coast of New South Wales. He has many followers, many of whom live as part of that community. He claims, and his followers believe, that through some miraculous process he is able to communicate directly with the Virgin Mary, for some reason, this regularly occurring on thirteenth of each month. He writes down what she says and these messages are passed onto his followers.

[3] At times some of his followers sought to ask the Virgin Mary specific questions. The process which was followed was that the member of the community would write down some questions and the offender would pretend to have received the Virgin Mary's answers to those questions, which he would also write down and give to the person who was seeking the information.

[4] This gave the offender a powerful way over which he could manipulate the beliefs and actions of his followers. In particular he was able to control the actions and desires of young girls with whom he wanted to have sex. Thus in the present case the complainant wrote a number of letters to the Virgin Mary and the offender pretended to receive answers from her to those questions, which were then passed on to the complainant.

[5] The questions were very poignant at times, demonstrating the normal everyday concerns and wishes of a young girl. Not surprisingly, given the age of the complainant at the time, the questions she asked were those of a child, not of a mature woman. The offender's response, which I repeat he pretended came from the Virgin Mary, was directed to persuading her to do things which would satisfy his sexual desire for her. That appears to have been the primary focus of the offender's written communications with the complainant.

[6] The offender told his followers many strange things. One of them, of central importance to the present case, was that there would soon be a new era, that he would be the last pope, living in Germany, and that he would be able to choose twelve queens and seventy-two princesses who were responsible for repopulating the earth once the new era had arrived.

[7] One thing that the princesses and queens had in common was that this process of repopulation would come about through them becoming pregnant to the offender after impregnation with his ‘mystical seed’.

…

[12] The complainant moved into the community with her family when she was a very young girl. Her mother was, and indeed remains, a devoted follower of the offender, so much so that she consented to the offender having sex with two of her daughters, even while he was married to a third. In those circumstances, it is in no way surprising to find that the complainant told no-one in authority outside the community about what the offender was doing to her until she left the community in 2002.”


	
	On the Crown’s case, which the jury by its verdict should be taken to have accepted, Mr Kamm’s sexual relationship with the victim commenced in 1994 when she was 14 years old and had been chosen by him as a “queen”. Mr Kamm was then 45 years old. He did not give evidence at the trial. Through his counsel, he did not dispute that he had a sexual relationship with the victim, but contended that it commenced when she was over the age of 16. However, there was evidence, including letters and a diary entry that corroborated the victim’s account that the sexual relationship commenced when she was 14 years old. Judge Berman described the Crown case against Mr Kamm as “remarkably strong.”
	
	
	In sentencing Mr Kamm, Judge Berman said:
	


“I am satisfied that the offender does not genuinely believe that the Virgin Mary told him to have sex with the complainant. The offender's belief is remarkably convenient for a person who wants to have sex with underage girls. I am satisfied he deliberately manipulated the complainant's beliefs, not because he wished to repopulate the earth, but simply because he wanted to have sex with her when she was fourteen years old.”


	
	Judge Berman took into account the delay between the offending conduct and the imposition of sentence. However, his Honour referred to what was, in effect, Mr Kamm’s ability to prevent his offending conduct coming to light for a lengthy period:
	


“… I note that this was not a case where the offender has lived in fear of the knock on the door for many years. What the offender did, by manipulating both the complainant and her family, was to ensure that she would not complain to anyone outside the community about what the offender was doing to her. It was part of the offender's manipulative efforts that he was able to commit these offences without any fear that the authorities would discover them.”


	
	Judge Berman further said of Mr Kamm’s offending behaviour:
	


“I find that the offence was part of a planned criminal activity. Indeed, the offender's modus operandi was to pursue the complainant and her parents through the use of fabricated communications with the Virgin Mary, to make them do something they would clearly not otherwise have done. The offender set out to achieve the objective of having sex with an underage girl and used his religious beliefs to achieve his ends. As I have mentioned, part of his planning also ensured that the risk of disclosure to people outside his religious community was minimised.”


	
	Judge Berman regarded the harm caused to the victim as being substantial, and that “she has suffered enormously, and will continue to do so, perhaps for the rest of her life.” His Honour also referred to the significant collateral harm caused by Mr Kamm:
	


“That the offender procured the complainant's acceptance of her unfortunate duty to have sex with the offender, through involving the complainant's family in his manipulations, has led to a significant and long lasting split in the complainant's family.

The offender's conduct has also severely damaged the complainant's religious beliefs and her ability to attend church.”


	
	Judge Berman noted that Mr Kamm had committed, and been sentenced for, prior sexual offences against another young girl who was also taken advantage of by his manipulations. He regarded Mr Kamm as not being a person with a prior good character. His Honour said:
	


“The offender now stands to be sentenced for six specific offences, but he is certainly not entitled to any leniency on the basis that these were isolated matters. The offender had an ongoing sexual relationship with the complainant which began in 1994 and ended in 1999 when she became pregnant with the offender's child.”


	
	In respect of the five offences under s 66C(2), Judge Berman imposed sentences, largely concurrent, of 5½ years, with a non-parole period of 3 years. For the offence of commit act of indecency under s 61O(1), his Honour imposed a 6 month fixed term of imprisonment.
	
	
	The effective total sentence imposed was a term of imprisonment of 10 years commencing on 14 April 2009 and expiring on 13 October 2015, with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months. Mr Kamm was eligible to be released on parole on 13 April 2013.
	
	
	On 10 December 2008 the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed Mr Kamm’s appeal against his conviction.
	


2005 conviction for prior sex offences


	
	On 14 October 2005 Williams DCJ sentenced Mr Kamm in respect of five sexual offences relating to the one female victim committed in 1993. The victim was then 15 years old. Mr Kamm was found guilty after a lengthy trial. The offences were not reported to police until mid-2002. Mr Kamm was arrested on 8 August 2002.
	
	
	The count of aggravated sexual intercourse involved digital penetration for between 15 and 20 minutes with associated kissing and fondling, while the indecent assault counts included kissing using his tongue and fondling of breasts and groin. In each case, the aggravating circumstance was that the victim was then under Mr Kamm’s authority.
	
	
	The victim’s family had moved to Mr Kamm’s religious community in 1991. Mr Kamm presented himself as receiving visits from the Virgin Mary and being able to communicate with her.
	
	
	Shortly prior to the first of the offences, Mr Kamm wrote a letter to the victim stating that she was to be one of his wives or “queens”. Judge Williams described the victim as “a very young immature girl at the time.” Her parents were overwhelmed by the apparent honour being accorded to their daughter, and supported the spiritual component of the relationship between her and Mr Kamm. Judge Williams said “it was in those circumstances that Mr Kamm began his sexual predations on this incredibly vulnerable young girl.”
	
	
	Mr Kamm did not give evidence at the trial. Through his counsel, he challenged the victim’s version of events and contended that any kissing that occurred was not indecent. A number of contemporaneous letters from Mr Kamm, which included sexually flirtatious language, corroborated the victim’s account. Judge Williams said:
	


“… he denies the offences took place and does not accept any responsibility for his actions nor does he think that his letter writing in particular was inappropriate.”


	
	Judge Williams said of Mr Kamm’s predatory conduct:
	


“… there was an inexcusable and gross breach of trust on his part that cannot possibly be explained or justified by reliance on any heavenly plan or permission. That breach led to a displacement of the relationship between the complainant and her own family, a traumatic shattering of this young girl's spiritual and emotional well-being and a disruption of her life and ongoing education at a crucial time in her development.”


	
	Judge Williams referred to a pre-sentence report which recorded Mr Kamm saying he was not guilty of the offences. The probation officer also noted that other persons interviewed during the preparation of the report shared similar beliefs and had overtly attempted to vilify the victim during discussions. Judge Williams referred also to a psychological report that included assessment of dynamic risk factors applicable to Mr Kamm.
	
	
	In considering the aggravated sexual assault, his Honour referred to the following factors:
	


“There was a significant age difference between Mr Kamm and his victim; the nature of the authority in question would, in all the circumstances that prevailed, place it at a higher level than would be the case say between a teacher and a pupil; the assault was protracted, lasting some fifteen to twenty minutes and she was, because of the special circumstances that existed, more vulnerable than might be expected of another young woman of a similar age. Mr Kamm's behaviour was not acceptable in the community at large and, one would think, even less acceptable in the community of which he purports to be the spiritual leader.”


	
	Judge Williams also said:
	


“I am concerned that in light of the reports available, there is a significant risk of re-offending. I am also concerned that Mr Kamm appears to have little or no insight into the wrongs of his behaviour.”


	
	In respect of each of the four counts of indecent assault, Judge Williams sentenced Mr Kamm to imprisonment for a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months to date from 14 October 2005. In respect of the aggravated sexual assault, Judge Williams sentenced Mr Kamm to imprisonment for four years from 14 October 2006 to 3 October 2010, with a non-parole period of 2½ years. The effective total sentence was thus imprisonment for 5 years, with a non-parole period of 3½ years.
	
	
	On 9 July 2007 the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed Mr Kamm’s appeal against his conviction: Kamm v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 201.
	
	
	Mr Kamm has no recorded convictions for non-sexual offences.
	
	
	During his present incarceration, Mr Kamm incurred institutional misconduct findings in January 2012 and June 2013 for providing false or misleading information to corrective officers (attempting to place the name of a friend, previously identified with his religious order, under the category of legal phone numbers, which would not then be monitored by staff), and unlawfully using a telephone.
	


The views of the sentencing court in respect of the index offence: s 9(3)(h1)


	
	The remarks on sentence of Judge Berman have been referred to above. His Honour categorised Mr Kamm’s conduct as predatory and noted the significant harm caused to the victim.
	
	
	By the sentence imposed, which allowed for operation of the statutory ratio, Judge Williams anticipated that Mr Kamm could be supervised in the community for up to 3 years. In the events that have occurred, Mr Kamm spent less than 12 months on parole.
	


Compliance with parole and supervision obligations - s 9(3)(f), (i)


	
	Mr Kamm became eligible for release on parole on 13 April 2013. The State Parole Authority refused his parole on March 2013 and again on September 2013 at a time when he had yet to complete the CUBIT sex offender treatment program.
	
	
	On 14 November 2014 Mr Kamm was released on parole. His conditions of parole included being subject to electronic monitoring. He was also subject to a curfew and to a direction not to associate with any persons currently or previously associated with the Order of Saint Charbel, unless approved by his supervising officer.
	
	
	Corrective Services NSW’s ESO Team has provided intensive supervision to Mr Kamm while on parole. A progress report dated 13 February 2015, prepared for the State Parole Authority, recorded that he had been compliant in respect of the conditions of his parole order and directions issued to him. He was described as having engaged co-operatively in his supervision.
	
	
	However, the progress report also noted that Mr Kamm continued to verbalise his innocence of the sexual offences for which he had been convicted and to maintain his robust religious beliefs. Christian icons dominated areas of his approved accommodation.
	
	
	Mr Kamm married his current wife in December 2014 and resides with her in a rented unit in Sydney. His wife resided in his religious community for approximately 18 years from 1984 to 2002. She was reportedly one of the “queens” in his community during the 1990s.
	
	
	The progress report noted, as a matter of concern, that Mr Kamm had made several attempts to have contact with individuals who are identified as supporters from the St Charbel community, and that only minimal contact had been permitted. This is reflective of his institutional misconduct.
	
	
	Prior to being released on parole, Mr Kamm had sought permission from Community Corrections to be able to reside at the location of his religious order at Cambewarra. He gave contact details for two people associated with the religious order, including a “Superior” of the order known as “Bishop Malcolm Broussard”. Mr Broussard was, in effect, Mr Kamm’s second-in-charge at the time of his sexual offending and prior to his arrest. Mr Broussard continues to be a supporter.
	
	
	During his parole period, Mr Kamm had contact with Mr Broussard. Mr Kamm describes him as currently in charge of the religious community. Mr Broussard has publicly espoused Mr Kamm’s innocence. On the day of the sentencing on 14 October 2005, Mr Kamm issued a general announcement that included the remark that “It would seem on the surface that the dark forces of evil have won a victory…”
	
	
	Mr Kamm has also had contact with Mrs Janice Williams, who Mr Kamm identifies as a support person. She is also associated with Mr Kamm’s religious order at Cambewarra, and is a person who Mr Kamm describes as looking after his business and personal affairs. Mr Kamm also states that he continues to receive gifts from his followers.
	
	
	A document dated 17 December 2014 records Mr Kamm seeking approval to apply to the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages to register a change of his name to William John Costellia.
	
	
	Mr Kamm has reported that he is in the initial stages of forming a political party.
	
	
	Since his release from custody, Mr Kamm has also had difficulties and instances of reported conflict with a former wife in connection with contact visits with their daughter. This has included mutual allegations of improper conduct.
	


Mr Kamm as a charismatic and mesmerising figure: s 9(3)(i)


	
	Mr Kamm has a demonstrated capacity to present as a charismatic and mesmerising figure who can attract many thousands of followers. These attributes have permitted him to gain ready access to under-age victims. This is a potent factor in connection with his risk of sexual recidivism.
	
	
	Mr Kamm has described himself as “a high profile person known throughout Australia and the world, for some 30 years.” In a letter to the Prime Minister dated 10 July 2003, he wrote: “The Religious Order that I founded in 1986 has grown to 160 countries and has some 500,000 members.”
	
	
	Similarly, Mr Kamm told Dr Lennings on 3 September 2015 that he had half a million followers in his order worldwide. He said he is still in contact with these members around the word and receives donations from them. Mr Kamm recently also told Dr Ellis he has an ability to heal others, and that he believes he may have cured cancer and blindness.
	
	
	Mr Kamm has also described women as having great respect for him as God’s Prophet or instrument, and that women stand in awe of him as a powerful and influential man. He has also recently said that “women were always attracted to me like a magnet” and “since I was a teenager women of all ages were attracted to me – I have always been a charismatic person.”
	
	
	Mr Kamm recently told Mr Sheehan that, throughout his life, females of all ages have been attracted to him. Mr Sheehan reported that he “said that females have been attracted to him because of his good looks, leadership and charisma, as well as his expansive knowledge of religion and other matters” although he “denied being attracted to ‘the youngsters’, but felt that they were generally attracted to him (not necessarily sexually).”
	
	
	In his sentencing remarks in 2005, Judge Williams also noted that:
	


“He [Kamm] told the Probation Officer that all money received for the Order is directed to him for disbursement among the members and other Orders. He said that many millions of dollars had been directed towards the Order. The Probation Officer commented that with respect to the commercial side of the organisation there appeared to be one shareholder in the entity, namely Mr Kamm and he was the owner of all the land and chattels that the community lives on. …

Charbel community has over 500,000 devotees who either reside in communities or are auxiliary members. He was the hub of the organisation and therefore holds considerable authority both within the community itself as well as within the organisation proper.

The Parole Officer felt that as a result of Mr Kamm's standing within the community effective supervision by the Probation and Parole Service would be difficult if he were to remain on community grounds. Apart from anything else, people close to Mr Kamm from within the St Charbel community have indicated that they view the present Court process as further evidence of his persecution by authorities.

A feature of supervision by the Probation and Parole Service either now or in the future would necessitate the direction that he relocate to more suitable premises ostensibly away from the St Charbel community. As to why that might be the case I do not particularly understand, although it may relate to the fact that Mr Kamm's standing within the community and perhaps the unwillingness of the community members to report anything adverse against Mr Kamm.”


	
	Through a corporate vehicle, Mr Kamm owns the property at Cambewarra. His followers still reside there.
	
	
	Mr Kamm’s religious order has many members who live in the general community rather than in a specifically designated religious community such as the one at Cambewarra. In an affidavit Mr Kamm swore in civil proceedings on 26 July 2009, he said:
	


“I founded a Religious Order known as the Order of St Charbel in approximately 1986 which, although based at Nowra, is now an international organisation. The Order follows the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. There are now communities in 167 counties and the number of members worldwide is approximately 500,000.

There are four separate Communities in Australia and it is not necessary for members of the Order to actually live in the Community although many choose to do so.”


	
	Mr Kamm has indicated an intention to live in a rural setting on a farm at Young once free of restrictions. In a letter dated 18 October 2014 addressed to “My beloved children” he wrote:
	


“Children, I will soon be free. I now need to put my life together again, but it will take time as I cannot live in the Community – so I am going to buy a farm and once I get married to Sandra we will live on the farm. All of you will be welcomed to live with us or stay with us from time to time – this choice will be yours. Of course, all of this will take time because in the meantime I have to live in the city as I am still under the control of the Parole Board who have placed conditions on my life until the end of 2015. During this time I will be able to meet you in town as often as you wish, and with the younger ones, your mother or other adults must come with you to meet me, only until my Parole is completed at the end of 2015.”


	
	Mr Kamm’s former wife has voiced concern that, in stating his intention to purchase a farm in rural NSW, he may be intending to set up another community.
	
	
	In connection with an interview undertaken with Mr Kamm on 1 August 2015, a departmental case note of the Community Corrections Officer (Allison Roberts) records that:
	


“William stated that he has been told by Jesus that he is `Abraham the second’ and he will lead a new set of 12 tribes of God’s chosen people on earth. It seemed that this will occur when the world is destroyed and Jesus returns to earth. …

I asked William why had he broken the Commandment `thou shall not commit adultery’ and he claimed that as a Prophet of God he can put his marriage responsibilities aside if a woman from his congregation approaches him and [wants] him to satisfy her needs or she was a child. He quoted the writings from Pope Innocent III who reigned from 1198 to 1216. He also claims that his behaviour is justified if God has commanded him to have relationships with women out of marriage and he quotes Saint Thomas `it is always reasonable to obey God’s commands because God’s wisdom is beyond the judgements of men’. William claimed that these writings justify him having sexual relationships with other women while he is married. (William faxed me the sections from the writings he has found on the internet). It appeared to me that he does not discuss this with his wife and seek her blessing.”

Level of compliance with reporting obligations: s 9(3)(g)


	
	A risk management report dated 6 October 2015, authored by Ms Allison Roberts of the ESO Team, records police having indicated that Mr Kamm has complied with reporting obligations in connection with the Child Protection Register.
	


Report from Corrective Services NSW - s 9(3)(d1)


	
	Ms Allison Roberts prepared a New South Wales Corrective Services “risk management report” dated 6 October 2015 pursuant to s 9(3)(d1) of the Act. That report outlines a continued management plan that has been formulated to assist in the supervision and case management of Mr Kamm, should he become subject to an ESO.
	


Sex offender treatment – s 9(3)(e)


	
	Mr Kamm participated in the CUBIT program between 27 March 2013 and 23 January 2014. The CUBIT Treatment Report dated 12 March 2014, prepared by Marie Rubio, recorded that throughout his time in the program, Mr Kamm “displayed grandiose and entitled behaviours.” He was reported as having completed work tasks promptly and as having built relations with other participants. However, his staunch religious beliefs and his denial and/or minimisation of his offending history limited aspects of his participation in the program. Ms Rubio said:
	


“Mr Kamm adamantly believes that ‘God can suspend natural law for a Prophet.’ As Mr Kamm upholds his religious beliefs, considers himself a Prophet and adheres to the calling of God, it remains unclear as to whether he truly accepts that he committed any of the sexual offences.

Mr Kamm denied committing the sexual offences, and as a result he did not appear to show any empathy and his responses did not indicate that he recognised the seriousness of his offences. For example, Mr Kamm stated that the victims were not forced or pressured into being with him. It seems that Mr Kamm rationalised his actions as fulfilling his role as a husband to the spiritual wives according to God’s commands.

…

Towards the end of the treatment program, he recalled and acknowledged some of the decisions he made leading up to and involving the offences. There appeared to be a reduction to the minimisations and justifications he used when attempting to avoid responsibility for the offences. This may be due to a slight change in his religious beliefs such as, according to Mr Kamm, God no longer requires spiritual wives until the ‘second coming’. This information was only provided by Mr Kamm towards the end of treatment. He wrote in his treatment journals that in 2006 he had asked God to change his plans. This all seems to be a result of Mr Kamm’s incarceration and other negative influences upon his religious group and the members. Yet he acknowledged that societal law must be obeyed over his religious beliefs to live an offence free life. As such, Mr Kamm gained an improved level of understanding of the issues surrounding his sexual offending outside of his religious beliefs. However, there remains a concern as to whether Mr Kamm’s pro-social intentions will be followed through, considering that his religious beliefs can be altered at any given time.

… throughout Mr Kamm’s time in the CUBIT program, he remained staunch to his religious beliefs. He never wavered from the belief that he possesses the power to receive messages from the Virgin Mary/God. He describes himself as a ‘seer’ and so, believes that he acts out God’s commands. It would seem that Mr Kamm’s behaviour (past and present) are all founded on his faith-based views that have created difficulties for him and remain a concerning factor.”


	
	Ms Rubio similarly was of the opinion that “there remains some minimisation and justification, as [Mr Kamm] continues to remain staunch to his religious beliefs.”
	
	
	Ms Rubio identified a number of dynamic risk factors including difficulties with sexual self-regulation. She also considered that Mr Kamm had continuing treatment needs. She recommended that upon his release from custody Mr Kamm should participate in the Community-Based Maintenance Program conducted by the Forensic Psychology Services (FPS) unit of Corrective Services NSW. Since his release from custody, Mr Kamm has been attending that program fortnightly.
	
	
	In his recent psychological risk assessment report, Mr Sheehan describes Mr Kamm’s participation in CUBIT as follows:
	


“He made modest progress, but did not come to acknowledge the scope and dynamics of his offending in a way that could realistically be considered as satisfactory.”

Psychiatric evaluation: s 9(3)(c) and (i) – November 2014 and July 2015


	
	Dr Gerald Chew provided a report dated 3 November 2014 for the State Parole Authority. Dr Chew reported that Mr Kamm could communicate with the Virgin Mary. Mr Kamm said this was a one-way communication in the form of visions approximately once a month, usually when he was awake but sometimes when he was asleep in the form of a dream.
	
	
	Dr Chew assessed Mr Kamm as presenting with a complex belief that is religious in nature. Dr Chew said he appeared to have a significant following in Australia and around the world. Dr Chew said, without this context, Mr Kamm’s beliefs about visions and prophecies could be considered to be hallucinations and delusions, but that the psychiatric definition specifically excludes fixed beliefs where there is a significant cultural or religious acceptance.
	
	
	Dr Chew opined that Mr Kamm did not meet the criteria for any major psychotic illness and was not suffering from schizophrenia or a delusional disorder. Dr Chew considered that Mr Kamm’s grandiose thoughts and speech may be associated with a degree of narcissistic personality. He recommended that Mr Kamm continue to participate in sex offender treatment. He did not undertake any risk assessment.
	
	
	Dr Andrew Ellis provided a report dated 30 July 2015 addressed to the Crown Solicitor’s Office. Dr Ellis interviewed Mr Kamm on 24 July 2015. He told Dr Ellis that he disputed the charges of which he was convicted and that it was very “easy” to charge a person with sexual offences. He also described each of the victims of his sexual offences as “sexually overactive and promiscuous” and of having been sexually interested in him from the age of 12. He denied any sexual relationship with the victim of the 1993 offences. He said he entered into a sexual relationship with the victim of the 1994-1995 offences only after she was 19 years old.
	
	
	Dr Ellis said Mr Kamm:
	


“… displayed consistent grandiose attitudes about his appearance, athletic ability, association with figures of importance and romantic prowess. He painted his victims in a negative light, and endorsed beliefs that young females are promiscuous, sexually active and have an interest in older men.”


	
	With respect to his asserted beliefs, visions and prophecies, Dr Ellis said that Mr Kamm’s “reported perceptual experiences are consistent with cultural phenomenon [sic] rather than the pervasive hallucinatory experiences of mental illness.” Dr Ellis also said that there was “no definitive way at psychiatric interview to determine if [Mr Kamm] truly believes the content of his expressed notions, or if they conveniently assist choices in his life.”
	
	
	Having regard to his offending history and his currently expressed attitudes, Dr Ellis made the provisional diagnosis that Mr Kamm meets the criteria for a paraphilic disorder. Dr Ellis said:
	


“Consideration is given to the presence of a paraphilic disorder, either paedophilic disorder or another specified paraphilic disorder (hebephilia). The behaviour recorded in the convictions indicates a sexual behaviour targeted at younger females. This may be consistent with paedophilic arousal if the females were prepubescent or in the early stages of pubertal change. This may also indicate a preferential arousal to youthful females known as hebephilia. From the behaviour recorded in the convictions preferential sexual expression was directed towards these younger females rather than his adult wife at the time. The number of letters written to the victims indicates a significant degree of fantasising about sexual activity with this age group. He currently holds attitudes that prepubescent and pubescent girls are sexually attracted to him, are promiscuous and sexually interested in older men. These cognitions are typical of persons with paedophilia or hebephilia. Thus, based on the documented tested evidence and his attitudes expressed at interview, there is significant clinical suspicion that a paraphilic disorder is present and related to the offending behaviour over a period of at least two years. This type of disorder should be monitored for and a provisional diagnosis would be made at this point. His self-report is at odds with this diagnosis but may indicate psychological denial or a lack of awareness of an attraction. If a disorder is present it would be classified as attracted to females and not exclusive in that he also expresses sexual attraction to adult women. Paraphilic disorders are chronic, relapsing conditions.”


	
	Dr Ellis also considered Mr Kamm met the diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder:
	


“He presents with a significant degree of relationship dysfunction in intimate partnerships over his adult life. Documents suggest conflict with established authority structures. This is accompanied by a grandiose sense of self-importance, a lack of empathy for others particularly his victims, a sense of entitlement and need to be regarded by figures of importance and a poor ability to self-reflect. He has fantasies of unlimited success such as one day potentially being declared pope. He gives a life narrative that suggests to himself he is unique from surviving supposed near death as an infant, to being a chosen person in a religious hierarchy. His use of financial control of the religious community suggests he is interpersonally exploitative. He would meet the criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder. This is consistent with his report of being abandoned by paternal figures in his youth. It is consistent with his previous self-report psychometric evaluation.”

Risk assessment (other than by court-appointed experts) – s 9(3)(c) and (d)


	
	Mr Graham Rendell, a psychologist with FPS, provided a pre-sentence report dated 14 September 2005. Mr Rendell’s risk assessment was undertaken prior to Mr Kamm being convicted of the index sexual offences, and had regard only to 1993 sex offences.
	
	
	Mr Rendell undertook psychometric assessment using the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (MCM-III), the Bumby Molest Scale (BMS) and Bumby Rape Scale (BRS). Mr Kamm presented with elevated scores in the Narcissistic Personality scale, suggesting that he perceived himself as special and likely to assume that many of the conventional rules of living with people did not apply to him. He also endorsed items that tend to minimise the importance of sexual abuse and an offender’s responsibility for a sexual offence.
	
	
	Mr Rendell considered Mr Kamm’s risk of re-offending with respect to both static (actuarial) and dynamic risk factors. In terms of actuarial risk, Mr Rendell scored Mr Kamm using the Static-99 instrument. His score placed him within the low risk category relative to other male sex offenders. However, Mr Rendell noted limitations applicable to the Static-99 instrument as a tool for predicting individual behaviour, and stressed the importance of clinical evaluation and the dynamic (or changeable) risk factors.
	
	
	Mr Rendell identified particular dynamic risk factors applying to Mr Kamm that serve to heighten his risk of sexual re-offending:
	


“The following dynamic risk factors, associated with Mr Kamm's future risk, need to be considered:

• His position as a ‘seer’ and a leader of a religious ‘family’. This provides him almost unlimited access to any vulnerable person within the ‘family’ and, by invoking ‘divine guidance’ a licence to behave in what would elsewhere be seen as an inappropriate manner.

• His psychosexual make-up, which includes sexual arousal to young girls.

• His seemingly limited victim empathy, particularly his failure to understand the degree of distress the victim may have experienced and the degree of damage his actions may have caused.

• His apparent confusion about sexually and socially appropriate boundaries for young people, and about what is appropriate to someone in a position of authority.

• His lack of insight as to how he planned and enacted the offences.

• His inadequate pro-social network of responsible non-collusive peers to support, monitor and supervise appropriate attitudes and behaviour.

…

Clinical decisions about risk, whilst taking an actuarial risk rate as a baseline, have to be made on the basis of dynamic risk factors specific to the offender, and in specific consideration of risk of what, to whom and under what circumstances. Whilst Mr Kamm's Static scoring may reflect the level of risk he represents to the mainstream community, consideration of dynamic risk factors and the circumstances of his offences suggest that he represents a significant risk of sexual assault to vulnerable women and young girls in his religious family, as long as he continues to be seen as a member of that family.”


	
	Mr Rendell said that Mr Kamm “has shown substantial lack of insight about the nature of his offence, and about the effect of his sexualisation of the victim.” Mr Rendell identified him as having extensive treatment needs and recommended that he undertake the CUBIT sex offender treatment program.
	
	
	When sentencing Mr Kamm for the 1993 sexual offences, Judge Williams said:
	


“I am concerned that in light of the reports available, there is a significant risk of re-offending. I am also concerned that Mr Kamm appears to have little or no insight into the wrongs of his behaviour.”


	
	Ms Rubio scored Mr Kamm as “-2” on the Static-99R actuarial instrument, thus placing him in the low risk category relative to other male sexual offenders by reference to actuarial considerations. However, Ms Rubio also noted the limitations applicable to the Static-99R. Dynamic risk factors included sexual self-regulation, general self-regulation, significant social influences, co-operation with supervision and intimacy deficits.
	
	
	In respect of sexual self-regulation, Ms Rubio said:
	


“This is an important risk factor for Mr Kamm, characterised by sexual interest in and arousal to adolescent females, use of sex to cope and a sense of sexual entitlement Mr Kamm seemed to associate sexual behaviour with feeling loved and a perceived sense of power. He described the immediate lead up to the offences as an act of commitment of friendship and love between two people under freedom of choice and consent. He acknowledged that his actions (offences) were an attempt to meet his needs by taking advantage of adolescent females for his own sexual pleasure and personal recognition. He reported being in a relationship with seven ‘spiritual’ wives at the one time and having to fulfil his role as a ‘husband’. Therefore, he created time alone (at motels) and wrote letters with sexualised comments. Sex also served as a way to cope with the stresses that ensued amongst them (jealousy). Overall, It would seem that sexualised behaviour appeared to reinforce his sense of grandiosity and fulfil self-worth.”


	
	While noting that Mr Kamm had made some progress in treatment in connection with this risk factor, Ms Rubio sounded a note of significant caution and emphasised his continuing treatment needs as follows:
	


“… it remains unclear whether Mr Kamm fully concedes that he created the opportunity for sexual interaction with adolescent female victims through the power and authority he held in the religious group. He created a plan to allegedly relinquish leadership of the religious group and abandon ‘all control’. Whilst this may reduce the previous unlimited access to vulnerable adolescent females who were led by him to believe they were fulfilling a godly command, continuing to be viewed by self and others as a ‘seer’ may not.

Mr Kamm requires regular attention to challenge his unhelpful attitudes and beliefs about sex and adolescent females and openly discuss any sexual arousal in the Community-Based Maintenance group.”


	
	In respect of general self-regulation, Ms Rubio said:
	


“This is another important factor for Mr Kamm. In the past, despite his stable work history and no criminal history, he engaged in controlling behaviours and attitudes. He failed to recognise the harmful and legal consequences of his sexual activity with adolescent females. He inhibited emotional expression to portray a judicious person, disregarded the needs and feelings of others as he abused the power and authority he held as a religious leader. Mr Kamm demonstrated some lack of insight into these patterns of thinking and behaviour. This is mainly due to his profound faith-based views that seemingly served to fulfil his own needs at the expense of others.”


	
	Ms Rubio noted work undertaken by Mr Kamm on this risk factor in CUBIT, but stated:
	


“In spite of these newly created strategies and proposed relinquished leadership role, Mr Kamm continues to view himself as a religious ‘seer’. This still may be seen by others as a position of power. Within the religious domain, Mr Kamm may continue to believe he is special and sustain grandiose behaviours and attitudes that may lead to unhelpful consequences.”


	
	In respect of significant social influences, Ms Rubio said:
	


“Mr Kamm's current social and support networks are those that follow and affirm his religious beliefs. It is evident that they were not adequate as a pro-social responsible group to discourage or confront Mr Kamm's interpretation of his spiritual mission and commands that lead to inappropriate behaviours. The people that supported and continue to support Mr Kamm have collaborated with him in minimising and denying the offences under the pretext of religious beliefs. This triggers uncertainty as to the integrity and effectiveness of this network of people acting as a protective factor to assist Mr Kamm in leading a pro-social and offence-free life.”


	
	While noting Mr Kamm’s asserted intention to renounce his leadership role in his religious order and to broaden his support network, Ms Rubio said an issue of concern was that:
	


“Mr Kamm continues to consider himself as a ‘seer’ that still embraces the notion of power and authority over others within the religious group. It would appear that this risk factor will always remain important as long as Mr Kamm has followers within a religious group or those that may follow his religious beliefs.”


	
	While on parole, Mr Kamm has continued to have contact with people from his religious order, who he identifies as supporters, including Mr Broussard and Mrs Williams. In addition, his wife formerly resided at his religious compound for many years.
	
	
	With respect to co-operation with supervision, Ms Rubio noted difficulties experienced with Mr Kamm in CUBIT and in custody (institutional charges), including minimisation and attempts to manipulate particular events, but noted some apparent improvement in this context during the CUBIT program.
	
	
	With respect to intimacy deficits, Ms Rubio noted, in effect, that Mr Kamm portrayed an ability to develop and maintain intimate relationships throughout his life, but that some of these relationships, such as where a woman became his “spiritual wife” together with other women, were problematic. Ms Rubio said:
	


“It may be that all these relationships were possibly strained by Mr Kamm's deep-rooted sense of entitlement and self-importance. The contact Mr Kamm had with the adolescent females was perceived by him as an act of God. He accepted that the victims admired and praised him and his work as a religious leader, obeying his directions. It is essential that he fully acknowledge and assent that it was an uplifting boost to his self-image in order to effectively challenge distorted beliefs around this issue.”


	
	Ms Rubio considered that, having regard to applicable dynamic risk factors, Mr Kamm’s Static-99R risk rating under-represented his risk of sexual recidivism.
	
	
	Dr Lennings provided a psychological risk assessment report dated 7 September 2015. For the purpose of his report, he interviewed Mr Kamm on 3 September 2015.
	
	
	Dr Lennings noted that Mr Kamm represents an idiosyncratic case in which “his charisma and control as a religious figure” are not easily addressed by conventional actuarial risk assessment. Dr Lennings said that having regard to his unique circumstances, including his status as a mystic with supernatural abilities, dynamic risk assessment provided the most useful measure of risk.
	
	
	Dr Lennings utilised the Risk for Sexual Violence Protocol (RSVP) to assist with dynamic risk assessment. Using the RSVP, he identified multiple risk factors “definitely present”, including chronicity of sexual violence, escalation, psychological coercion in sexual violence, sexual deviance, problems with planning, problems with treatment and psychopathic personality (as demonstrated through Machiavellianism and Dissocial Personality Disorder).
	
	
	Dr Lennings further identified, as risk factors “somewhat present”, attitudes that support or condone sexual violence, problems with self-awareness, problems with supervision, problems with intimate relationships, problems with non-intimate relationships and problems with employment. He said:
	


“On the basis of the dynamic risk assessment Mr Kamm’s risk rating is high, and if he is able to avoid supervision of his behaviour his manipulative and deceitful manner as well as intense egocentricism and narcissism will likely lead to further attempts at offending. …

Mr Kamm is an elderly man who reports a long history of mystical experiences. These experiences have established himself in the role of a prophet and he has leveraged that position to obtain both financial and sexual advantage from others. His sexual behaviour has appeared at times as hypersexual, and focuses on teenage women and he likely has a significant sexual deviance associated with his sexual interests. He describes an ongoing active sex life and his continuation as a ‘seer’ means he continues to promote the mechanism whereby he took advantage of young people previously. Although he has distanced himself from his theory of Queens and Princesses his explanations sound facile (he asked God to exempt him) or later, in interview implied that such a philosophy only pertained to the Second Coming and in any case referred to immaculate conceptions. Mr Kamm presents as scoring high on dimensions assessing deceitful and manipulative behaviour. I do not believe he is frank in his dealings with others, and easily asserts himself over others. His writings indicate that he has a special relationship with God that exempts him from both temporal and canonical law.

… Given the history of sexual deviance and hypersexual behaviour it is likely he represents an ongoing risk of deviant behaviour if opportunity were to allow for that to occur. To manage his risk such opportunity needs to be managed.”


	
	Dr Lennings assessed Mr Kamm as meeting the diagnostic criteria for Machiavellianism and Dissocial Personality Disorder. In respect of the latter diagnosis, Dr Lennings noted that Mr Kamm has been recorded as evidencing callousness and a lack of concern for others, as having a persistent disregard for social norms, an incapacity to experience guilt and a marked proneness to blame others. His behaviour was said to be outside cultural expectations, to be enduring and to create an adverse impact on his environment. Dr Lennings considered that Mr Kamm might also meet the diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder.
	
	
	In respect of risk of sexual re-offending, Dr Lennings concluded:
	


“In considering the risk assessment it appears there is a high likelihood of further serious sexual offending should Mr Kamm be released into the community without supervision. [Dr Lennings cross-referred to applicable risk factors and continued.] The majority of these risk factors are quite stable, that is despite his age, which ordinarily might be expected to reduce the intensity of his risk, in Mr Kamm’s case I believe his risk factors remain enduring and unlikely to fluctuate much for the foreseeable future. Medical or health issues may intervene to reduce sexual desire, or sexual performance over time, but for the moment that is not foreseeable. His deviance, manipulativeness and underlying lack of empathy and concern for others is a stable function of his personality and the wellspring from which his risk derives.”


	
	Dr Lennings referred to the manner by which Mr Kamm’s reported history as a “seer” and “prophet”, in light of his criminal history, impacted upon his risk of sexual recidivism:
	


“Mr Kamm has worked out how to influence others and close their minds to critical thinking by appealing to people on the basis of deep religious conviction. He combines his revelations with interpersonal control to obtain both financial and sexual gratification. He brooks no criticism of his behaviour and had developed a coterie of like-minded people who also seemingly took advantage of the influence Mr Kamm could wield to enforce standards of behaviour that are at odds with accepted community standards. His belief system is instrumental to the modus operandi by which he committed his offences. That he continues much of the trappings of this belief system (having put his theory of Queens and Princesses into abeyance for the moment) indicates he continues to manifest the precursors for an offence should he not be under scrutiny and accountability for his behaviour.”


	
	Dr Ellis assessed Mr Kamm’s risk of sexual recidivism utilising clinical judgement guided by the RSVP instrument. He assessed him as meeting the diagnostic criteria for a Paraphilic Disorder (provisional diagnosis) and Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Dr Ellis identified deviant sexual arousal and personality disorder as key features in connection with Mr Kamm’s risk of sexual recidivism. Dr Ellis said:
	


“Deviant sexual arousal is consistently identified as the most prominent risk factor for sexual reoffence. Mr Kamm’s offence history indicates this pattern of arousal with preference for sexual activity with female minors. Offending continued in a chronic pattern. Psychological coercion or ‘grooming’ was employed in order to gain access to the young victims. Some of this included an exhortation to the peculiar religious beliefs of the victims, and other techniques were more prosaic appealing to a sense the victim was special, isolating them or taking them to restaurants. Psychological coercion of the religious community and families was also employed, reinforcing the compliance of victims. He displays a specific stereotype of victim. Antilibidinal medication is the best treatment to address deviant arousal. Behavioural techniques may reduce deviant arousal. …

Antisocial personality orientation is another factor consistently identified with sexual reoffence. He is not diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, but another related personality disorder. Malignant narcissism is related to the interpersonal aspects of psychopathic personality traits such as glibness, superficial charm, grandiosity and lack of remorse. These traits have a moderate association with repeat sexual offending. Disordered personality function can interfere with honesty in treatment, cooperation with restrictions, passive-aggressive sabotaging of treatment progress, and be a risk for development of at risk mental states such as anxiety and depression. Personality difficulties often lead to conflict within relationships, and subsequent distress and negative mood states associated with offending. He describes long term relationship dysfunction, including during periods of offending. His institutional adjustment while superficially positive covers over underlying contempt for the justice system. There is some evidence in his institutional charges of acts to subvert aspects of his supervision. His prior engagement with treatment has been poor. While he does not make statements that endorse antisocial behaviour directly, he is yet to demonstrate sustained maturation of his interactional style. There is therefore need to continually address personality function as part of any ongoing treatment process. Denial is relevant in this case as it potentially leads to obfuscating during offence specific rehabilitation.”


	
	Dr Ellis noted that Mr Kamm had undertaken the CUBIT sex offender treatment program but noted that his “performance in this program was rated as displaying minimisation and justification for his actions based on religious beliefs and only a slight shift in personal responsibility.” In connection with his assessment Dr Ellis said:
	


“At this review he displayed a reversion to denial of offending, no understanding of risk factors for offending and a view that further work was unnecessary due to his professed innocence.”


	
	Dr Ellis assessed Mr Kamm with a high risk of sexual recidivism in the context of a potential return to a closed community, which could give him ready access to and influence over potential victims. Dr Ellis said:
	


“All risk of sexual violence is heavily dependent on context. The previous sexual offending occurred in a very specific context. His position as property owner and spiritual leader of the ‘Order of St Charbel’ gave him private access to and influence over young females living on the property and their families. This influence was both spiritual and material. The population he moved in describe themselves as faithful and socially inexperienced. Should he return to a similar context the risk of repeat behaviour would be considerable. Given his financial and social status in the group, plus a desire he would wish to provide assistance to the group into the future indicates without supervision this context could readily recur.

A consideration of the type of possible sexual offence should be considered in an estimation of risk. In the case of Mr Kamm, given the particular pattern of sexual arousal, the likely type of victim would be a female child in a situation where they were alone or in a position of vulnerability. The associated intimidation, shame and loss of a sense of bodily integrity would be of the type where serious psychological injury is foreseeable. Damage to their understanding of faith and community would be likely if he were to employ previous psychological coercion tactics.

In considering actuarial, structured professional and clinical parameters in the absence of any treatment or supervision, Mr Kamm would fall into a group of persons with a risk for serious sexual offending that is of high concern in the context of return to, or access to a remote and closed community and of a type with serious consequence. Specific treatment and supervision would likely reduce this risk. “


	
	Dr Ellis regarded anti-libidinal medication as indicated to address Mr Kamm’s deviant sexual arousal. However, he noted that he has indicated that he would not take such medication. Dr Ellis regarded Mr Kamm as requiring long-term supervision and treatment and said that his “psychiatric disorders are chronic and likely to persist beyond any period of supervision.”
	


Reports of court-appointed experts – s 9(3)(b)


	
	Dr Jeremy O’Dea has provided a report dated 3 December 2015. For the purpose of his report, he examined Mr Kamm on 9 and 12 November 2015.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea reported that Mr Kamm told him he continued to experience “visions” approximately once or twice a month. These visions were of fully formed individuals “floating above me”. Mr Kamm also told Dr O’Dea that, in 1983 or 1984, the visions wanted him to stop employment and to set up his religious community, and that God gave him instructions to buy the property. He also said that “Our Lord” would appear to him down at the property where a spring would come out of the ground and that it did. Like Lourdes, the water helped heal people from cancer and blindness.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea reported that Mr Kamm denied having committed both sets of sex offences. However, he said that he had been the victim of sexual abuse by a priest as a child.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea diagnosed Mr Kamm as meeting the criteria for a personality disorder with narcissistic, antisocial and psychopathic traits. Dr O’Dea expressed the view that Mr Kamm would not satisfy the psychiatric criteria for a paraphilic disorder having regard to various matters including the number of adult heterosexual relationships through his life. Dr O’Dea did, however, state that Mr Kamm’s offending conduct could be conceptualised as “heterosexual hebephilia” and could properly be the focus of treatment and management:
	


“… his apparent specific and strong sexual urges and fantasies towards post pubescent female children, associated with evident grooming behaviours such as the writing of the letters to the victim of the first set of sex offences, and his index sex offending behaviours, may be conceptualised within the category of heterosexual hebephilia. Whilst, given his history, this would not be considered Mr Kamm’s exclusive, or even predominant sexual preference, nor would it be considered a psychiatric disorder, in and of itself, it may be the focus of treatment and management due to the potential effects of such behaviour on the victims.”


	
	Dr O’Dea was not able to exclude a related psychiatric diagnosis in connection with the visitations or apparitions Mr Kamm claimed to experience. He said Mr Kamm’s responses to such visitations demonstrated poor insight, judgment and emotional control. Even if it is considered that religious “visitations” or apparitions may not constitute psychopathological experiences indicative of psychiatric illness, that did not mean that someone experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations of a religious context was not also suffering from a psychiatric illness:
	


“Indeed, in Mr Kamm’s case, the fact that these ‘visitations’ are far removed from the general mainstream thinking and experience, are interpreted in a highly religiose and intensely personal manner, and are acted upon in a demonstrative and dramatic manner, that demonstrate at least intense narcissism and grandiosity, poor insight, poor judgement and poor behavioural control, and occur in the context of wider interpersonal and social issues for Mr Kamm, and have caused significant suffering to others, would raise concerns that they are visual and auditory hallucinations of a delusional quality.

It may be tempting to dismiss Mr Kamm’s reported ‘visitations’ as part of his wider shared religious beliefs and experiences, and/or as a self-serving expression of his grandiosity, narcissism and religiosity, and justification for his sexual deviance, rather than indicative of a major psychiatric illness. However, I have not had access to significant information detailing other people’s direct and credible support for Mr Kamm’s account of the exact nature and content of his ‘visitations’ and specific religious calling, and his conduct, other than reference to the involvement of the family of the victims of sex offences, and he appears to continue to hold the core religious beliefs that progressed to the ‘visitations’ related to his sex offending behaviours.

In addition, even if it is to be accepted that the ‘visitations’ and their callings are not indicative of major psychiatric illness, his response to them, including of grooming and engaging in sexual relations with post pubescent female children, demonstrates poor insight, judgement and emotional control, within the standards of the current secular society.”


	
	Dr O’Dea noted that on a Static-99R actuarial assessment Mr Kamm presented as low risk of sexual recidivism but that, having regard to other (dynamic) considerations, his actual risk was greater:
	


“… in Mr Kamm’s case, his ongoing ‘visitations’, and his apparent ongoing involvement with his religious beliefs and endeavours, and his level of grandiosity and narcissism, and his poor insight, judgement and behavioural controls, would together point to him having a greater risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community in the long term, and of committing a further serious sex offence, as defined in the New South Wales Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, particularly if he were to return to his religious practice and followers, with this risk the appropriate focus of specific and structured risk management in the community in the long term.”


	
	Dr O’Dea further said:
	


“… from a full clinical psychiatric risk management perspective, and with reference to various actuarial and more so called dynamic risk assessment instruments, Mr Kamm’s risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community in the long term would be considered significant and appropriate for specific community management as outlined above.”


	
	Dr O’Dea also reported that Mr Kamm’s history as a “seer”, “prophet” and “visionary”, capable of leading and persuading others to his forms of belief, appears to have facilitated his sex offending, and is likely to be a factor in his ongoing risk of recidivism, particularly if he were to return to his prior religious activities. Dr O’Dea referred to Mr Kamm’s denial that he committed the offences. Dr O’Dea said:
	


“Whilst denial by a person of their sex offending history does not, in and of itself, predict future sex offending, in Mr Kamm’s case, his denial of his sex offending behaviours may be understood in the context of his broader psychiatric issues, including his problems with insight and judgment, and point to greater risk of recidivism.

More specifically, it would seem reasonable to consider that there would be a significantly high degree of probability that Mr Kamm would be likely to commit a further ‘serious sex offence’ (as defined in Section 5(1) of the New South Wales Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006) in the community in the long term, if these above outlined treatment interventions above were not successfully implemented in the context of community supervision and monitoring. Whilst it is not possible, or clinically appropriate, from a psychiatric perspective, to place a percentage likelihood of Mr Kamm committing a further ‘serious sex offence’, the significance of this risk from a clinical perspective may be considered commensurate to the likelihood as I understand is referred to in legal terms in Tillman v Attorney General for New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 327.”


	
	Mr Patrick Sheehan provided a report dated 15 November 2015. For the purpose of his report, he examined Mr Kamm on 3 November 2015. Mr Sheehan reported that during interview Mr Kamm showed social skills and was persuasive in his manner. Mr Sheehan said:
	


“He did exhibit grandiosity in his repeated reference to himself as a charismatic and important person, a public figure connected with ‘famous’ and influential people, and comparing himself with influential historical figures. …

His discourse in interview did appear dominated by efforts at impression management and he did not impress as candid or open. He reliably presented information in a self-serving way. He appeared cognitively intact, demonstrating linear thought (the ability to think in an organised way), and ability to concentrate throughout a lengthy assessment. However, in terms of his understanding of himself, his insight was poor and he presented himself in a one dimensional way. He was unable to be drawn into discussion of his personality or faults. He seemed rigid in his beliefs and perceptions of himself and others.”


	
	Mr Sheehan recorded Mr Kamm as reporting he had a role to play as the leader of God’s people in the second coming of Christ. He regarded Mr Kamm as meeting the diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Mr Sheehan said:
	


“Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) is defined as a pervasive and enduring pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behaviour), need for admiration and lack of empathy, as indicated by: grandiose sense of self-importance, preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited power, success, power, brilliance, beauty or ideal love, beliefs of being special and unique, associated with high-status people, requiring excessive admiration, sense of entitlement, interpersonal exploitation, and haughtiness. In my opinion, this is Mr Kamm’s primary diagnosis in terms of shaping the development of the behaviours associating with his offending. In my view, there is a clear nexus between his NPD and his faith-based beliefs and activities. That is, his self-promotion as a prophet and his establishment of a religious order have provided a perfect opportunity for him to nurture grandiose feelings of self-importance and unique association with powerful entities (such as God), as well as foster a network of people to admire him. …

Mr Kamm’s Narcissistic Personality Disorder is chronic and in my view relatively severe. It is unlikely that there will be any appreciable remission in this disorder as long as Mr Kamm remains enmeshed in his fantasies of power as a mystical prophet.”


	
	Mr Sheehan did not assess Mr Kamm as meeting the criteria for antisocial personality disorder or a paedophilic disorder. He did, however, state that he may meet the criteria for Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder (Hebephilia), involving a sexual interest in pubescent or early adolescent females.
	
	
	In assessing Mr Kamm’s risk of sexual re-offending, Mr Sheehan had regard to actuarial assessment and also applicable dynamic risk factors including his problems in benefiting from treatment, superficial co-operation with supervision, and association with members of his order. Mr Sheehan said:
	


“Mr Kamm is assessed as within the low risk category with regard to actuarial factors. However, he continues to exhibit a number of important dynamic risk factors that are both recognised as relevant factors in literature as well as the known correlates of offending in Mr Kamm’s particular case. Although he has completed an intensive treatment program and cooperated with community supervision, I do not believe that he has done enough to infer any confidence in his ability to independently manage his own risk in the absence of externally imposed supervision. The overall totality of evidence leads me to estimate that Mr Kamm’s risk of committing a serious sex offence to be in the moderate to high risk category relative to other adult male sexual offenders. His risk is towards adolescent females whom he comes into contact with through his faith-based activities. Should any evidence of sexual preoccupation emerge, I would re-evaluate his risk estimate to the high-risk category. …

In my opinion the totality of available information suggests that Mr Kamm will remain predisposed to creating environments comparable to that in which he sexually offended. That is, by meeting his need for ego gratification through surrounding himself wherever possible by people who believe him to be a powerful and mystical figure. Without the influence and containment of supervision, there may be few impediments to such a situation escalating to a sexual offence should he meet adolescent females to whom he is sexually attracted.”


	
	Mr Sheehan summarised his view regarding the risk presented by Mr Kamm as follows:
	


“Mr Kamm’s performance in the community has been largely without incident. He does not outwardly reject supervision. He has participated in the Community Maintenance Program, received intense supervision, monitoring and case management by CSNSW. However, he continues to deny his offences and has made only partial and temporary adjustments to his beliefs and future plans regarding his self-appointed role as a religious prophet. In my opinion, in the absence of supervision he is highly likely to place himself in high-risk situations, mostly by surrounding himself with people who believe him to be a supernatural prophet, whose behaviour and perceptions he can control through his account of his ‘visions’. There is also a high likelihood for him to continue to choose his sexual partners from this group of people. His ideological construct remains that it is open for him to return to sexual interactions with a range of females of varying ages if he feels so instructed by God. This removes any sense that he is personally responsible for moral consideration of his actions. Taken together, this leaves little protection against Mr Kamm sexually reoffending. I would estimate that in the absence of supervision, Mr Kamm would present a moderate to high risk of committing a further serious sexual offence. The risk is chronic and may persevere until such time that his advancing age moderates his personality disorder and sexual motivation. In my view, the proposed supervision plan is adequate to manage Mr Kamm’s risk in the community.”

The State’s submissions


	
	The State submitted that, having regard to the supporting material and expert evidence, Mr Kamm is properly to be regarded as presenting a continuing and appreciable risk of sexually re-offending against under-age females. This risk arises particularly in connection with his dangerously unorthodox religious beliefs, his narcissistic traits, the persistence of beliefs which enable him to rationalise his conduct, and his demonstrated ability to obtain access to, and exercise influence over, potential victims.
	
	
	Further, this appreciable risk remains even if Mr Kamm does not re-establish his participation in a closed community compound such as Cambewarra. Mr Kamm continues to maintain and to espouse his unorthodox religious beliefs. By his own account, many of the members of his religious order live in the general community rather than in a closed compound. There are also real concerns that, if an ESO is not made, following the expiration of his parole order Mr Kamm will further re-integrate with members of his order and position himself in a rural area, away from scrutiny and in a manner that will provide ready access to under-age followers. Having regard to his history and current presentation, along with his propensity to minimise or deny his offending behaviour and his lack of insight into its seriousness, there is a clear justification for intensive monitoring and supervision of the type provided by an ESO, coupled with a continued focus on directing Mr Kamm to address outstanding treatment needs.
	
	
	The State contended that the following matters are relevant not only to the discretion to grant an ESO, but also to whether I would ultimately be satisfied that Mr Kamm is a ""high risk sex offender"" for the purposes of s 5B(2):
	



	
	Mr Kamm has a history of sexual offending against under-age females in a manner that was chronic and caused significant harm to his victims.
	
	
	Mr Kamm has been assessed as presenting a potential for further serious sexual offending, should he be released into the community without supervision, which is variously described by experts on the basis of clinical assessment and with regard to dynamic risk factors as a “high” likelihood, a “significant” risk, or as being within the “moderate to high” risk category.
	
	
	Dr Ellis has identified Mr Kamm as having a paraphilic disorder (provisional) centred upon deviant sexual arousal. This disorder is described as being a chronic, relapsing condition that is resistant to treatment and rehabilitative efforts.
	
	
	Mr Kamm has a co-morbid Narcissistic Personality Disorder that impacts upon his treatment and response to supervision. He is further assessed as meeting the diagnostic criteria for Machiavellianism and Dissocial Personality Disorder, meaning that he is manipulative and deceptive.
	
	
	Mr Kamm has expressed an unwillingness to take anti-libidinal medication to address his deviant sexual arousal.
	
	
	Mr Kamm has a demonstrated and longstanding propensity to present as a charismatic and mesmerising figure who can attract many thousands of followers. This has provided him with ready access to, and influence over, followers, including under-age victims.
	
	
	Mr Kamm continues to present himself as the “Little Pebble” and to preach his unorthodox religious views via the Littlepebble.org website. He continues to have contact with members of his religious order.
	
	
	Mr Kamm’s religious order still exists and people associated with it continue to reside in the property at Cambewarra. Mr Kamm’s company owns the property.
	
	
	Mr Kamm continues to deny having committed the sexual offences for which he has been convicted and demonstrates little or no insight into his offending behaviour or his risk of sexual recidivism. He is without empathy for the effect of his conduct upon his victims. Mr Kamm has described each of the victims of his sexual offences as being ""sexually overactive and promiscuous"" and of having been sexually interested in him from the age of 12.
	
	
	Treatment of Mr Kamm thus far is at an early stage and has had only minimal positive impact. As Mr Sheehan has put it, ""Mr Kamm has only a superficial level of engagement in the treatment process"".
	
	
	Mr Kamm does not appear to interact with non-collusive peers who can adequately challenge problematic behaviour on his part, given that his wife and other identified supporters are associated with his religious order and have been his followers.
	
	
	Mr Kamm has significant treatment needs that have not been fully addressed, as well as a need for long-term supervision. These treatment needs can be met, at least in part, by participation in the Community-based Maintenance Program that FPS conducts.
	
	
	Mr Kamm has not had any lengthy period of supervision in the community of the type contemplated by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	In the absence of supervision and support of the type that could be provided by an ESO, Mr Kamm is likely to return to the high risk behaviours associated with his sexual offending.
	


Mr Kamm’s submissions


	
	It should be noted that Mr Lange of counsel on behalf of Mr Kamm made the following uncontroversial but very proper concessions for the purposes of various matters with which the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act is directly concerned:
	



	
	Mr Kamm is a ""supervised sex offender"" within the meaning of s 5I.
	
	
	At the time the summons was filed Mr Kamm was a ""supervised sex offender"".
	
	
	The offence for which Mr Kamm was detained was a ""serious sex offence"" within the meaning of s 5(1).
	
	
	The present application was brought within the last 6 months of Mr Kamm’s custody or supervision as required by s 6(2).
	



	
	The burden of Mr Kamm’s submissions was that the prospect that he might re-offend was contextual, meaning that the offences occurred in situations where he had access to vulnerable members of his spiritual community. As there was no appreciable likelihood that he would return to the Cambewarra community or anything similar, the risk of sexual offences with under-age females was remote. In such circumstances, having regard to the absence of any prospect that Mr Kamm would re-offend with strangers, he could not be considered to be a high risk sex offender.
	
	
	Mr Kamm submitted that in order to be satisfied of the test under s 5B, I had to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that he would return to the community, and assume a mentoring role, or otherwise start a fresh community, which would give him access to potential victims. There is no such evidence, and certainly none that would support an inference to the requisite standard. Even accepting Dr Ellis’ opinion that Mr Kamm’s “financial and social status in the group, plus [a] desire he would wish to provide assistance to the group into the future indicates without supervision this context could readily occur”, Mr Kamm contended that such a conclusion did not rise to a sufficient level of satisfaction. While there is always the possibility that Mr Kamm may re-engage with the order and its members in a more active way if not supervised, the evidence about that is unsatisfactory. In this regard, it should also be noted that none of the material on Mr Kamm’s website demonstrates or suggests that social media have been used to gain access to potential victims.
	
	
	Mr Kamm emphasised what was said in State of New South Wales v Donovan [2015] NSWCA 280 at [80]:
	


""The Act is to be construed in accordance with its text and so as to promote its purpose or objects. That said, the State, properly, conceded that s 3(1) cannot mean literally what it says, for there will always be some level of risk to the safety and protection of the community.""


	
	Accordingly, Mr Kamm submitted for this reason alone that the order should not be made.
	
	
	Furthermore, Mr Kamm submitted that a number of factors would lead me to conclude that he does not pose an unacceptable risk of committing further relevant offences. In this regard, the expert evidence does not speak entirely with one voice. While Dr Lennings places Mr Kamm in the high risk category, Dr Ellis says he falls ""into a group of persons with a risk of sexual offending that is of high concern.” Dr O'Dea desists from making a likelihood prediction and Mr Sheehan says that Mr Kamm poses a moderate to high risk. In those circumstances, I could not conclude that Mr Kamm poses an unacceptable risk.
	
	
	In considering the opinion of Dr Lennings, it should be remembered that it appeared to be based upon the assumed dichotomy that Mr Kamm would always pursue his criminal behaviour unless otherwise impeded by external factors, such as incarceration, supervision, or external scrutiny. However, for the period after the last offence in 1995 until 2002 there is no evidence that Mr Kamm engaged in deviant behaviour, or that he was in some way prevented from doing so had he wished. As Dr Lennings conceded, if there was a cessation of such conduct, that could affect the assessment of the risk posed by Mr Kamm.
	
	
	Mr Kamm is now 65. As confirmed by Mr Sheehan during cross-examination, and stated by Dr Ellis in his report, ""offenders over the age of 60 show very low rates of re-offending as a group."" Mr Kamm’s age stands in contrast to his age at the time of the commission of the offences, when he was in his mid-40s.
	
	
	Mr Kamm submitted that the forensic evidence is insufficient to permit me to conclude that he poses an unacceptable risk of the commission of further relevant offences.
	
	
	Furthermore, Mr Kamm submitted that I should also take into account the very burdensome nature of the conditions, which are sought by the State to be imposed, either as part of the balancing exercise when considering the risk posed or alternatively in deciding whether to make the order at all. Because the type of offending in which it is said Mr Kamm might engage is very specific, other less drastic means are available to monitor him should a concern about his conduct arise. For example, there is no reason to suppose that an order pursuant to s 8 of the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004 could not be made.
	


Consideration


	
	Section 5B of the Act is as follows:
	


“5B High risk sex offender

(1) An offender can be made the subject of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order or a high risk sex offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk sex offender.

(2) An offender is a ‘high risk sex offender’ if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(3) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence.”


	
	In my opinion, Mr Kamm poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision. I am satisfied that he does so to a high degree of probability. My reasons for coming to that conclusion are as follows.
	
	
	Mr Kamm has a criminal history of highly manipulative, opportunistic and cynical predation upon under-age females for his sexual gratification by grooming and deception. In that respect Mr Kamm used the persuasive influence upon vulnerable individuals of fabricated communications with religious identities or alleged spiritual beings. Although a considerable therapeutic or clinical benevolence is evident in the psychiatric analysis of whether Mr Kamm’s visitations or communications are pathological delusions or self-serving lies, it is ultimately irrelevant for present purposes whether Mr Kamm’s predispositions and propensities are the function of an identifiable mental illness or not. I much prefer the approach taken by each of the sentencing judges who were astute in identifying Mr Kamm’s behaviour as pretence.
	
	
	I have set out at some considerable length the opinions and conclusions of a large number of medical specialists who have examined Mr Kamm over many years. I was considerably aided in that task by the written submissions of counsel whose summaries of the medical findings are uncontroversial. Indeed, as Mr Lange of counsel specifically conceded, Mr Kamm “does not take issue with the diagnosis of his personality”, with which to a considerable extent that medical material is concerned.
	
	
	It seems to me to be evident to the point of comfortable satisfaction that Mr Kamm has no insight into his offending, has demonstrated no remorse for his actions and possesses no understanding of the effect of his actions upon his victims. Mr Kamm remains convinced that he is a special person with an impressive and predetermined destiny. He continues even now publicly to reaffirm these arguably delusional self-perceptions. A reference to the Little Pebble website, with material from which I have been provided, conspicuously supports this. The difficulty for present purposes is that these perceptions, which were at the heart of Mr Kamm’s original offending, show no significant or appreciable sign of attenuation.
	
	
	Mr Kamm continues to maintain his innocence. That is so notwithstanding two unsuccessful appeals against his convictions to the Court of Criminal Appeal. One unavoidable conclusion from the fact that Mr Kamm continues to view himself as blameless is that I cannot be confident that he would now consider the repetition of his offending conduct as either criminal or even morally wrong. Whatever disincentive to repeat offending may exist in the prospect of detection or further incarceration, Mr Kamm does not also appear to have any appreciation of the total unacceptability of his behaviour. That is apparent from his revelations to some of the various experts who have examined him. In short, in circumstances where the opportunity to do so arises, Mr Kamm has been assessed as having no self-regulatory abilities to resist reoffending.
	
	
	Mr Kamm’s contentions are predicated upon the notion that the opportunity for further offending will not arise. However, Mr Kamm has not disavowed his delusional view of himself as a seer or a prophet or howsoever his imagined special circumstances might be characterised. It is Mr Kamm’s extraordinary view of himself that has previously afforded him the assumed authority to commit criminal acts with under-age women. It is in my view only a short step from repeating such conduct as long as Mr Kamm perceives or professes himself to have divine sanction for his conduct. Restoration of Mr Kamm as the residential leader of a religious commune does not seem to me to be the single precondition to the commission of further serious sex offences. In my opinion it is essential to keep Mr Kamm under strict and close supervision even in the wider community.
	
	
	Although none of the medical professionals referred to has used the term, Mr Kamm’s particular sexual predispositions appear to be almost intractable. It will be recalled that Dr Ellis considered that Mr Kamm’s psychiatric disorders were chronic and likely to persist beyond any period of supervision. To the extent that his condition may be amenable to therapy, no tangible advances have so far been demonstrated. Mr Kamm therefore remains likely to commit further serious sex offences against female minors. He poses an unacceptable risk of doing so unless he is kept under supervision.
	


Duration


	
	The State contended that the general approach taken by Johnson J in State of New South Wales v Tillman [2008] NSWSC 1293 at [62]-[66] is informative:
	


“[62] In fixing the term of an extended supervision order, the Court is guided by the objects in s 3 of the Act to ensure the safety and protection of the community and to encourage serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation. Unlike a sentence of imprisonment, an extended supervision order may be varied or revoked under s 13 or a second or subsequent supervision order may be made against the same person: s 10(3). This reflects the different objects of the Act and the measures which the Act allows to achieve those objects.

[63] I do not think it is helpful to draw upon analogies from the area of sentencing law such as the concept of a ""crushing sentence"". The totality principle is designed to avoid a Court imposing a ‘crushing sentence’ in the sense that ‘it will induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release’: R v MAK (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at 164; [2006] NSWCCA 381 at [17]; Kerr v R [2008] NSWCCA 201 at [27].

[64] The conditions of the extended supervision order which I propose to make in this case will themselves contain an element of flexibility. The Act provides incentive or encouragement for a person to maintain progress towards rehabilitation. The conditions of the order will provide a framework in which an objective measurement of rehabilitation may be made. At the same time, the terms of the order will serve to protect the community. All of this will occur, in this case, in the context of a person released from a decade in custody facing a range of challenges which will test the progress he has made, and allow him to demonstrate progress in a non-custodial, but nevertheless supervised context. This will be a long-term project.

[65] In the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that an extended supervision order should be made for a period of five years. I do not consider that such a term will have a negative impact on the Defendant's prospects of rehabilitation.

[66] As Fullerton J observed in Attorney-General for NSW v Hadson at [32], much will depend on how the Defendant responds to the current program and whether any variation to the risk-management strategy is called for as assessed by those who manage him and monitor his progress.”


	
	The experts are agreed that Mr Kamm will require long-term treatment.
	
	
	Dr Ellis expressed the following view:
	


“From a psychiatric perspective a period of five years is considered reasonable in order to improve function in the community, and refine the appraisal of risk. Paraphilias are chronic, relapsing conditions and resistant to treatment and rehabilitative efforts. His comorbid personality style impacts upon likely treatment and supervision response. It is most likely that a period of 24 months will be required to maintain a stable mental state and regular meaningful activity both occupational and social in the community, given the restrictions on persons subject to extended supervision orders. He likely requires an alternative plan than engagement with his past religious activities. A further 36 months of regular treatment in a psychological program, coupled with regular review of antilibidinal medication should they be prescribed would be necessary. The psychological program should focus on methods for controlling deviant sexual arousal and moderating his narcissistic interactional style. This period is estimated based on his current mental state, likely paraphilia, personality style and current attitudes to supervision that will be unlikely to change in the short term. …

His psychiatric disorders are chronic and likely to persist beyond any period of supervision, but may be better internally controlled at that point.”


	
	Dr Lennings was of a similar opinion:
	


“Should an ESO be sought the duration of that ESO will depend on the duration of Mr Kamm's maintenance of his privileged position as a religious authority and seer. He remains committed to his theory of being a prophet and continues to address his half million followers around the world. He continues to promote his role as a man of mystical importance. As long as such behaviour is manifest so his risk will remain. It is not possible for me to see how long that might be, but I suspect his role is now so ingrained into his personality, and the advantages from it, such as financial support, are so central to his existence, that he will with only the greatest reluctance forsake that role. I do not believe [that] will occur within the next five years, so I perceive a five year limit as necessary to contain his risk.”


	
	Dr O'Dea put the matter in these terms:
	


“Despite his age, Mr Kamm's risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community, and of committing a further ‘serious sex offence’ in the community, is likely to be longer term, and potentially of at least 5 years duration. Therefore, from a psychiatric risk management perspective, any appropriate risk management program implemented should be long term and at least of 5 years duration. However, it should be regularly monitored and reviewed every 6 to 12 months dependent on his progress.”


	
	Finally, Mr Sheehan relevantly said this:
	


“Given the chronic nature of Mr Kamm's entrenched personality dysfunction it is simply not realistic to expect total extinction of the negative features of coping (the need to maintain a grandiose self-image through his faith-based activities) in the short or even medium term. Successful management will involve a gradual process of reduction and containment of these behaviours until such a time as they lessen in frequency and severity. In this respect, a five-year order would seem practical.”


	
	Mr Kamm contended that a shorter period would be preferable inasmuch as it would operate as an incentive or encouragement to him to change over time and respond to treatment. Although the legislation provides that an order for 5 years can be made, a lesser period may be adopted. Significantly, the assessments of the various practitioners are based on a variety of dynamic risk factors, suggesting the possibility of change over time. Mr Kamm submitted that a shorter period would give recognition to the fact that circumstances may change and recognise the very intrusive nature of the order: see, for example, New South Wales v Bowdidge [2015] NSWSC 717 at [34] and State of New South Wales v Lynn [2015] NSWSC 665 at [84].
	
	
	Section 13(1) of the Act provides that the Supreme Court may at any time vary or revoke and extended supervision order on the application of either the State or the offender. One of the bases upon which the Court may revoke an extended supervision order is if it is satisfied that circumstances have changed sufficiently to render the order unnecessary. In the present case the expert medical opinion strongly favours the imposition of conditions for the maximum period of five years. I can see no reason why that opinion should not be accepted and applied. If there is a change in circumstances, or for any other reason, Mr Kamm can apply for a revocation of the order. Far from operating as a disincentive or discouragement, Mr Kamm would to a considerable extent become the author of his own destiny.
	
	
	I consider that the order should be made for the maximum period allowable.
	
	
	The State proposed a series of conditions to which Mr Kamm should be subjected. I have largely adopted those conditions. However, I have deleted some of the proposed conditions that appeared to me to be unnecessary or inappropriately restrictive and I have amended others. Having regard to the risk posed by Mr Kamm, the conditions appearing in the Schedule to these reasons seem to me to be more than adequate to deal with the unacceptable risk that I have identified.
	


Orders


	
	In the circumstances I make the following orders:
	



	
	Order pursuant to s 5C of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 that William Kamm be subject to a high risk sex offender extended supervision order for a period of 5 years from today.
	
	
	Direct pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 for the period of the high risk sex offender extended supervision order that William Kamm comply with the conditions set out in the SCHEDULE to these orders.

		08 January 2016",2016-01-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768669,SafeWork v Omega International and Shetty [2016] NSWDC 11,"The defendant, Omega International Coatings Pty Ltd, repairs industrial coatings at its premises at two places in Kurrajong Avenue, Mount Druitt. In the course of the preparation of those coatings, inflammable liquids are combined.
	
	
	On 28 January 2011, when an employee, Mr Konchok Lama, was decanting toluene from a 1,000 litre container into another container for the purpose of manufacturing paint thinner, the toluene ignited, causing an extensive fire.    
	
	
	The defendant is charged pursuant to s 8(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (the Act) that it failed to ensure that the defendant’s employees including Mr Lama and two other persons were not exposed to risk to their health and safety contrary to s 8(1) of the Act.
	
	
	The particulars of the charge are in summary that:
	


First the defendant failed to adequately assess the risks that could arise from operations at the site including the risks of the decanting system and the risk of failing to dissipate static electricity.

Second that the defendant should have ensured that the container being used for decanting was of a suitable type with antistatic wires that prevented the possibility of ignition and,

Third, that the defendant failed to provide adequate information, instruction and training to Mr Lama in relation to his work.


	
	The cause of the ignition was the discharge of static electricity. In the course of agitating toluene there is a risk that static electricity may build up and that its discharge may cause a spark.
	
	
	In order to obviate that risk the appropriate practice is that each container be fitted with a static wire leading from the contents to an earthing cable on the steel cage of the container. Through those connections any accumulation of positive electrons within either drum may safely pass to earth.
	
	
	It is common ground that Mr Lama properly connected the earthing cables of the donor drum and the recipient drum to earth. He failed however to notice that there was no static wire in the recipient drum leading from its contents to the steel cage and earthing cable.
	
	
	Mr Lama gave evidence and I accept him as a witness of truth.
	
	
	He was by training and experience well qualified to conduct the decanting operation. He was employed by the defendant in 2002 but before that worked for Caltex in New Zealand. He was well aware of all safety procedures concerning safe delivery and unloading of flammable substances.
	
	
	After joining the employment of the defendant he received intensive training from Mr Wilkinson, an experienced industrial chemist. He was trained in the importance of precautions to eliminate potential dangers from ignition sources such as static electricity.
	
	
	In the course of his employment with the company he was provided with copies of various safety manuals which he read and considered.
	
	
	I will come to those manuals in due course, but it is apparent from his training he was warned, specifically by Mr Harry Fuimaono of the dangers of static electricity and the importance of using the antistatic and earthing straps while decanting flammable substances, and the need to avoid any ignition sources such as mobile phones.
	
	
	Before the incident Mr Lama was aware that the antistatic wires were essential to provide a means for static electricity inside the plastic containers to dissipate.
	
	
	The company purchased bulk containers from two main manufacturers, Univar and AusChem. Mr Lama said that he had used thousands of these containers since at least 2007 and had not in all of that time come across any container which lacked the static electricity wire which was lacking in this particular container.s
	
	
	After the fire hundreds of bulk containers in the possession of the defendant were examined and four only were found to lack the necessary static wire.
	
	
	Mr Lama says that he was aware before the decanting process of the need to ensure that such a wire was in place but on this occasion he failed to check. Had he checked, consistent with his training and his instructions, he would not have decanted the liquid and the risk would not have arisen.
	
	
	There is no causal relationship between the existence of the risk and any failure by the defendant to provide adequate information, instruction or training to Mr Lama.
	
	
	Further, although the defendant is charged with failing to assess the risk that could arise in the operations at the site, the evidence is overwhelmingly to the contrary.
	
	
	Omega acquired the business in February 2000. It was then manufacturing water solvent based paints.
	
	
	When Omega acquired the business it engaged as an employee, Mr Wilkinson, who had 30 years’ experience in the paint manufacturing industry. It further engaged a consultant, Mr Barry Bone of Petrolink Pty Limited, to prepare preliminary hazard analyses in relation to the premises adjoining the premises in which this accident occurred. Mr Bone had previously prepared safety documentation for the storage and handling of dangerous goods at the request of the former owner of the business.
	
	
	In September of 2002 Omega commissioned the production of a Dangerous Goods and Handling Manual from an accredited dangerous goods consultant referred by Petrolink.
	
	
	In mid-2005 Omega again retained Mr Bone to provide advice and guidance and prepare documentation in relation to Omega’s proposed construction of a purpose-built manufacturing facility.
	
	
	Between July and November 2005 Mr Bone prepared a Qualitative Analysis Safety Management System, a Safety Manual and a Fire Safety Study. He also prepared documents relative to a development application by Omega that addressed similar issues.
	
	
	The Safety Management System, the SMS Manual, which was prepared by Petrolink, prescribed operating procedures for liquid transfers, included the mandatory attachment of static leads between the host and the receiver vessels. The manual provided that:
	


The host containers must be earthed and the receptacle must be monitored to dissipate static electricity… 


	
	The SMS manual under the heading “Control of Static Electricity” provided that “Earthing and bonding conductors for dissipating static receivers need to be sufficiently robust to withstand mechanical corrosive influences”.
	
	
	In 2008 Omega employed Mr Nourhan Demirdjian as a paid chemist. Mr Demirdjian developed a risk assessment process, for a number of work procedures, including a decanting work procedure.
	
	
	The Decanting Work Procedure produced by Mr Demirdjian required employees to ensure the minimisation of static electricity, and for decanting not to take place unless the containers were suitably bonded to dissipate static electricity using static straps.   
	
	
	The dangers which came to pass were well recognised by the defendant and the defendant took all reasonable steps to inform itself and to put in place procedures to obviate that risk.
	
	
	The risk arose because of the discrete and signal failure by Mr Lama, notwithstanding his training and the systems devised and implemented by the defendant.
	
	
	The failure of Mr Lama is in human terms perhaps understandable because the static wire in thousands of containers was ultimately found to be lacking on only five containers including the one which caused the incident.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the defendant failed to adequately assess the risks or take steps to obviate them by a systemic method, nevertheless the defendant is vicariously liable for the failures of Mr Lama to follow instructions. It was Mr Lama who should have ensured that the container used for decanting or receiving the decanted liquid was fitted with an antistatic wire.
	
	
	The failures of the defendant, then, were not of a systemic nature. They consisted of the defendant’s vicarious liability for the casual act of negligence by Mr Lama.
	
	
	The gravity of the offence is a synthesis of the potential harm, which was substantial, and the degree of culpability which led to the risk of that harm eventuating. In the present case I find the culpability to be extremely low and the gravity of the offence, because of the nature of the forces involved, to be, because of that fact, only moderate.
	


MITIGATING FACTORS


	
	The defendant, notwithstanding its trade in a high risk industry, does not have any significant record. It has two prior convictions in relation to failure to label drums. In one case a drum filled with a different material was fitted with a label to indicate the nature of a second material which additional label failed to entirely obscure the label which pre-existed. In that case, certain information for consumers had been left off the label.
	
	
	I regard the offender as being of good character and without any significant record of prior convictions. The offender is unlikely to reoffend and has shown remorse and contrition for the offence. A plea of guilty was entered and, while not perhaps entered at the first available opportunity, I take into account that the prosecution wished to allege other causal acts which had no basis in substance and it was reasonable for the defendant to resist.
	
	
	Nevertheless, in recognition of the need for general deterrence, this is a matter in which a fine which is not insignificant should be imposed.
	
	
	The defendant calls in aid s 6 of the Fines Act 1996 in which the court is to consider the accused’s means to pay. The corporate defendant has, since 2011, traded at a loss. It continues to operate because it obtains a tax benefit due to research and developments offset tax.
	
	
	Mr Shetty, a director of the time, says that if a substantial fine were imposed it is likely Omega will be unable to pay the fine and the outcome will be insolvency. Such a consequence would result in the redundancy of the company’s employees, which in view of the safe operation of this enterprise for 15 years, would be most regrettable.
	
	
	The maximum penalty is $825,000. I find an appropriate penalty in all the circumstances to be $50,000. I discount that sum by 20% in recognition of the plea of guilty and cooperation with authorities. The defendant is convicted and fined $40,000.
	
	
	The prosecutor is to have a moiety of the fine.
	
	
	I reserve the costs orders pending written submissions.
	
	
	It would be appropriate if such submissions were to be accompanied by affidavits setting out the factual matters on which my decision may be based.
	
	
	Mr Shetty is charged pursuant to s 26 of the Act in that he, being in a position to influence the conduct of the corporation, failed to use all due diligence to prevent the contravention. It is difficult to see what more Mr Shetty could have done, given my conclusion that this was caused by a casual act of negligence which was not condoned by any of the systems which Mr Shetty had set in place.
	
	
	Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that the purposes of sentencing include the need to ensure the offender is adequately punished, to prevent crime by deterring the offender, to protect the community, to provide for the rehabilitation of the offender, to make the offender accountable for his actions, to denounce the conduct of the offender and to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime in the community.
	
	
	In this circumstance there was no harm caused to anyone, and it is not necessary to denounce the conduct of Mr Shetty; rather his conduct in seeking to ensure the safety of his operations is to be commended.
	
	
	Section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that I may dismiss the charge without recording a conviction.
	
	
	In applying this provision I am to consider Mr Shetty’s personal characteristics, which I find to be honourable, and the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed.
	
	
	Pursuant to section 10 I dismiss the charge and record no conviction. I make no order for costs.

		24 February 2016",2016-01-31 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2768676,TC v R [2016] NSWCCA 3,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: The applicant, TC, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by North DCJ in the District Court on 20 June 2014 in respect of an indecent assault upon a young boy, committed almost 38 years earlier.
	
	
	The applicant had pleaded guilty on 20 February 2014 in the Local Court to the offence of assault a male person and commit an act of indecency on him, contrary to s 81 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), since repealed. The victim of this offence was a 9 year old boy. The maximum penalty for this offence at that time was penal servitude for 5 years.
	
	
	The applicant had also asked for a further matter on a Form 1 to be taken into account by the sentencing judge pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). This further offence was an indecent assault upon a female who was under the age of 16 years, contrary to s 76 of the Crimes Act, since repealed. The victim of this offence was a 12 year old girl, the sister of the young boy, the victim of the principal offence. The maximum penalty for this offence at that time was 6 years penal servitude.
	
	
	The judge convicted the applicant and ordered him to enter into a good behaviour bond, pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, for a period of two years from 20 June 2014.
	
	
	The essential objective of the present application is to have the formal conviction expunged.
	


Circumstances of the offences


	
	The sentencing judge proceeded on the basis of a statement of agreed facts.
	
	
	The applicant was the boyfriend of the male victim’s older sister and a guest residing in her family home. The applicant slept in an enclosed verandah where the male victim and his brother also slept. The female victim slept in an adjacent bedroom with her sister, the applicant’s girlfriend.
	
	
	The offences occurred on a night in October or November 1976, when the applicant was approximately 17½ years of age.
	
	
	The young boy had gone to bed. Sometime later he awoke to feel something hitting his face. The applicant was naked next to the boy’s bed. The applicant was rubbing his penis around the boy’s face and outside his mouth. The boy was shocked and scared. He pushed the applicant's penis away and the applicant moved backwards. The boy pulled the sheet and blanket over his head and turned away. About an hour later, the boy went back to sleep. This conduct constituted the principal offence.
	
	
	On the same evening, the young girl awoke to feel someone squeezing her breasts. The applicant was naked next to her bed. The applicant smelt of alcohol and Vaseline and the girl felt something moist on her hand. The applicant held her hand and moved it up and down his penis. The girl was very scared. After about 30 seconds, she pulled her hand away and ran to her sister's bed. Her sister was not in bed. The girl told the applicant twice to “go away”. He left without responding. This conduct constituted the further offence on the Form 1.
	
	
	The girl ran to her parents' room and told them what had happened. The victims' father went to the verandah and spoke with the applicant. The father returned to his room and said that the applicant was drunk, he could not do anything that night and he would sort it out in the morning. The following morning the victims' father told the applicant to leave.
	
	
	In about 1995, the male victim disclosed the incident to his wife. He had not previously disclosed the incident to anyone. The following year he told another sister, who told him something similar had happened to his other sister.
	
	
	In September 2012, both victims reported the incidents to police. In June 2013, the applicant attended a police station and participated in a notebook interview with police. The applicant admitted that he knew both victims but denied any knowledge of the offences. The applicant told police he occasionally stayed overnight at the victim’s home during his relationship with their older sister but did not reside there. The applicant was charged with the offences on 26 June 2013.
	


The applicant’s subjective circumstances


	
	The applicant was aged 55 years at the time of sentence and in full-time employment as an investment business analyst with the Australian Capital Territory public service. He is tertiary educated. The applicant is single and has had no significant relationships.
	
	
	The applicant gave affidavit evidence and was cross-examined at the sentencing hearing. The applicant said he had no recollection of the offences but accepted full responsibility for them, and was sorry for the harm he may have caused the victims. He said that it was a “tremendous shock” when he was informed of the offences.
	
	
	The applicant said he was “very unstable” at the time of the offences. As a result of various family difficulties, including his mother dying of cancer when he was 15 years of age and his father remarrying, he had become homeless as he could no longer reside with his father and his new wife and family. He found it very difficult to cope with the loss of his mother and could not accept his father’s new relationship. He was drinking alcohol at this time.
	
	
	When pressed in cross-examination, as to whether the difficulties he experienced as a teenager played some part in his offending, the applicant said that he had “no idea”. The applicant could not answer questions in cross-examination about whether he committed the offences for sexual gratification, because he could not recall them. He denied that he had a sexual attitude towards children.
	
	
	The applicant had received treatment for a pulmonary embolism in 2013 from which he said he had not fully recovered. The applicant said that he suffered from an anxiety disorder at that time as a combination of his health condition and the criminal proceedings brought against him. No medical evidence was tendered on the applicant’s behalf. He was not receiving any psychological or psychiatric treatment at the time of the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	Although he has no record of prior convictions, in 2001 the applicant received a good behaviour bond for a period of 12 months without conviction pursuant to s 10(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for an offence of wilful and obscene exposure contrary to s 5 of the Summary Offences Act 1988 (NSW) (2001 offence). That conduct involved the applicant exposing himself to two 13 year old girls near a public place. The applicant was aged 41 years at that time. The maximum penalty for that offence was 10 penalty units or imprisonment for six months.
	
	
	The applicant’s current employment position is subject to probation. He gave evidence that he was anxious to avoid a conviction in view of the likely effect on his present and future employment prospects.
	


The sentencing judge’s reasons


	
	The sentencing judge found that the offending would have been frightening, shocking and unexpected for the 9 year old victim; nonetheless the offending was not prolonged (ROS 5). His Honour referred to the victim impact statement and found that the harm to the male victim was at the level to be expected for a brief but graphic indecent assault (ROS 5).
	
	
	His Honour accepted that it was a very old offence (ROS 5 and 6). He noted that it occurred when the applicant was just 17 years of age, not yet an adult. He accepted that the applicant was intoxicated at the time, was obviously immature and that the offending was spontaneous and unplanned (ROS 7.5).
	
	
	The judge assessed the objective seriousness of the principal offence as not at the very lowest end but still “well below mid range” (ROS 7).
	
	
	With respect to the Form 1 offence against the young girl, his Honour found this to be “quite a serious example of a s 76 indecent assault, again involving skin on skin contact but without undue prolongation and without any violence or threats” (ROS 7-8).
	
	
	His Honour referred to the applicable principles for sentencing historical child sexual assault matters, including R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368 at [31] and [57], which he accepted he was required to apply.
	
	
	His Honour summarised the applicant’s subjective case including his age, his full-time employment and his tertiary education. He accepted that the applicant’s employment required him to have a conviction-free record and that a conviction might blight his employment prospects and make it more difficult for him to travel.
	
	
	His Honour referred, on more than one occasion, to the applicant’s youth at the time of the offending. He accepted that the applicant was a very distressed and lonely young man at that time. He observed:
	


Indeed he was still a child at law and had the offence been reported at the time it occurred he would have been dealt with in the Children’s Court (ROS 11).


	
	His Honour took into account the 2001 offence of wilful and obscene exposure in deciding whether the applicant was deserving of leniency in light of his youth. Reference was made to R v Hutchins (1958) 75 WN (NSW) 75 and R v Boney (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), Grove J, 22 July 1991, unrep).
	
	
	His Honour accepted that the applicant was remorseful for the offences.
	
	
	His Honour found that the applicant had not suffered the suspense and uncertainty of what might happen to him for 38 years as he did not have any real memory of the offences.
	
	
	His Honour accepted that the plea of guilty had been entered at the first opportunity and the applicant was entitled to a 25% discount.
	
	
	His Honour acknowledged that the sentencing exercise was a “difficult” matter. He was satisfied that a penalty other than imprisonment was appropriate given, amongst other things, the historical nature of the offending. He noted the sentencing option urged by the applicant’s legal representative was a s 10 bond without recording a conviction.
	
	
	Nonetheless, his Honour concluded that it was inappropriate not to record a conviction given the objective seriousness of the offending, taking into account the Form 1 matter and extent of leniency to be afforded to the applicant given the 2001 offence. His Honour proceeded to impose the sentence already mentioned.
	
	
	The applicant relies upon two proposed grounds of appeal, which are related.
	


Ground 1: The judge erred in failing to take into account the sentencing regime in respect of juveniles at the time of the offences.


	
	In written submissions at the sentencing hearing, the applicant’s legal representative submitted (para 29) that had the applicant been sentenced in the Children’s Court contemporaneously with the offending, the focus would have been “on matter(s) of rehabilitation as opposed and balanced with specific and general deterrence”. In oral submissions before the sentencing judge, reference was made to the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) and the discretion of the Children’s Court under s 14 of that Act in respect of an offence, which is disposed of summarily, not to record a conviction in respect of a child who is of or above the age of 16 years. The applicant’s legal representative urged the judge to consider the option of a bond under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act without recording a conviction.
	
	
	The applicant’s legal representative did not specifically refer the judge to the Child Welfare Act 1939 (NSW), since repealed, or the range of available sentencing options under that statutory regime. The Child Welfare Act governed proceedings in respect of juveniles at the time of the offences and until its repeal by the Miscellaneous Acts (Community Welfare) Repeal and Amendment Act 1987 (NSW), followed by the introduction of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act.
	
	
	The applicant accepted in this Court that the sentencing judge correctly noted the principle in R v MJR and that the matter would have been dealt with in the Children’s Court had the offences been reported when they were committed. The applicant’s complaint is a narrow one – the sentencing judge did not take into account the statutory regime in respect of juveniles at the time of the offences, namely the Child Welfare Act.
	


Child Welfare Act


	
	Under the Child Welfare Act an offender aged 16 years or more but less than 18 years at the time of the offence was designated a “young person”: s 4. The Child Welfare Act conferred on the Children’s Court jurisdiction to deal with offenders who were young persons at the time of the offence, but of or above the age of 18 years and less than 21 years of age when charged with the offence: s 20(2).
	
	
	The Children’s Court was given a discretion to hear and determine proceedings in respect of indictable offences summarily other than homicide, rape or other offences punishable by death or life imprisonment: s 12(1).
	
	
	The powers of the Children’s Court in determining indictable offences dealt with summarily, were contained in s 83(2) and (3) of the Child Welfare Act. It is appropriate to set out the terms of those subsections in full:
	


83.

…

(2) Where a child or young person is charged before a court with an indictable offence (other than homicide, rape or an offence punishable by death or penal servitude for life), and the charge is heard and determined in a summary manner, the court may if the child or young person admits the offence, or the court finds that the charge is proved—

(a)   release the child or young person on probation upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed or as the court may, in any special case, think fit, and for such period of time (whether expiring before or after the date upon which the child or young person attains the age of eighteen years) as the court may think fit; or

(b)   commit the child or young person to the care of some person who is willing to undertake such care upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed or as the court may, in any special case, think fit and for such period of time (whether expiring before or after the date upon which the child or young person attains the age of eighteen years) as the court may think fit; or

(c)   commit the child or young person to the care of the Minister to be dealt with as a ward admitted to state control; or

(d)   commit the child or young person to an institution either generally or for some specified term (whether expiring before or after the date upon which the child or young person attains the age of eighteen years) not exceeding three years; or

(e)   in addition to or in substitution for any committal under paragraph (d) of this subsection, require the child or young person to enter into a recognizance with or without a surety or sureties to be of good behaviour and to comply with any terms and conditions the court may specify, for a term which shall not be less than twelve months or more than three years, and in default of entering into such recognizance may direct that the child or young person shall be detained or further detained in a shelter or an institution for a period not exceeding three months unless such recognizance is sooner entered into:

Provided that committal to a shelter shall not exceed thirty days:

Provided, further, that in no case shall the total term of such detention and further detention together exceed three years.

(3) Where a child or young person is brought before a court and charged with an offence (other than homicide, rape or an offence punishable by death or penal servitude for life), the court, if the child or young person admits the offence, or if it finds that the charge is proved but that, having regard to all the circumstances and to the welfare of the child or young person, it is inexpedient to make any order under subsection one or subsection two of this section, without proceeding to a finding of guilt, may make an order—

(a)   dismissing the charge; or

(b)   admonishing and discharging the child or young person; or

(c)   discharging the child or young person conditionally on his entering into a recognizance with or without sureties to be of good behaviour and to comply with any terms and conditions the court may specify and to appear for a finding of guilt and to be further dealt with in accordance with the provisions of this section if called on at any time during such period not exceeding three years as may be specified in the order.


	
	It may be observed that there were a range of sentencing options available to the Children’s Court, other than imprisonment, under s 83(3), where it was inexpedient to make an order under s 83(2) in respect of a young person. Those options were either dismissing the charge, or admonishing and discharging the young person, or discharging the young person conditionally on his or her entering into a recognizance to be of good behaviour, in each case without proceeding to a finding of guilt.
	


Decision


	
	Although the principal offence and the further offence on the Form 1 were indictable offences, it may be accepted that those offences could have been dealt with by the Children’s Court in a summary manner under s 83(2).
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant frankly conceded that the likely disposition of the matter, had it been prosecuted in the Children’s Court proximate to the time of the offences, cannot now be established because of the paucity of available information. This is unsurprising because most cases dealt with in the Children’s Court are unlikely to have been reported. Nonetheless, it is conceivable that the applicant’s offending may have been dealt with pursuant to s 83(3) of the Child Welfare Act.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that whilst the judge was not specifically taken to the Child Welfare Act and its relevant sections, he was referred to the availability of the same or very similar sentencing options that were available to him under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, which included the proposed option of a bond without recording a conviction.
	
	
	Importantly however, the judge did not refer to either statutory regime in his remarks on sentence. Thus it is not apparent that the judge took into account the sentencing options in respect of juveniles at the time of the offences under the Child Welfare Act, let alone under the subsequent statutory regime. Accordingly, the judge must be taken to have failed to sentence in accordance with the standards at the time of the offence: R v MJR.
	
	
	The Crown properly accepted in oral argument that if his Honour did not sentence having regard to the Child Welfare Act, that would be an error of the kind referred to in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505 and this Court would not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at [42].
	
	
	Ground 1 is made out.
	
	
	Although strictly unnecessary to do so, I will consider ground 2 because it relies on substantially the same matters as are relevant to the question whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law.
	


Ground 2: The sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust


	
	A submission that a sentence is excessive (or inadequate) derives from the last kind of error identified in House v The King at 505. To make good this ground, the applicant must demonstrate that the sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust”: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6].
	
	
	As has been frequently stated, the task is not for this Court to decide that it would have exercised its discretion differently: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at [15]; Dinsdale v The Queen at [57]; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [28]. The relevant question on appeal is whether the sentence is within a proper range: Morgan v R (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371 (Hunt CJ at CL); Papworth v R [2011] NSWCCA 253 at [54] (Hoeben J (as his Honour then was); Whealy JA and Simpson J agreeing).
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that when regard is had to each of the matters listed in s 10(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the judge’s decision to record a conviction is unreasonable or plainly unjust. It is appropriate to set out the terms of s 10:
	


10 Dismissal of charges and conditional discharge of offender

(1)    Without proceeding to conviction, a court that finds a person guilty of an offence may make any one of the following orders:

(a) an order directing that the relevant charge be dismissed,

(b) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding 2 years,

(c) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into an agreement to participate in an intervention program and to comply with any intervention plan arising out of the program.

(2)    An order referred to in subsection (1)(b) may be made if the court is satisfied:

(a) that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment (other than nominal punishment) on the person, or

(b) that it is expedient to release the person on a good behaviour bond.

(2A)    An order referred to in subsection (1)(c) may be made if the court is satisfied that it would reduce the likelihood of the person committing further offences by promoting the treatment or rehabilitation of the person.

(2B)   Subsection (1)(c) is subject to Part 8C.

(3)   In deciding whether to make an order referred to in subsection (1), the court is to have regard to the following factors:

(a) the person’s character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition,

(b) the trivial nature of the offence,

(c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed,

(d) any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider.

… .


	
	Counsel for the applicant placed emphasis on each of the factors mentioned in s 10(3): the applicant’s antecedents; the nature of the offence; the applicant’s extenuating personal circumstances; and two other matters – delay and the impact of a conviction on the applicant’s present and future employment prospects.
	
	
	The applicant’s contention is that in all the circumstances, any sentence other than a non-conviction is unreasonable and plainly unjust.
	


Decision


	
	The difficulty with this ground is that the judge’s remarks on sentence demonstrate that he considered each of the factors relied upon by the applicant in an entirely appropriate manner as outlined below.
	
	
	As to the applicant’s antecedents, counsel for the applicant accepted that the subsequent offence in 2001 may properly be taken into account for the purpose of considering whether leniency should be extended to the applicant in light of his youth: R v Hutchins; R v Boney. The judge did not treat the 2001 offence, which did not proceed to conviction, as an aggravating factor. He was correct not to do so in the absence of a conviction on the 2001 offence: R v Price [2005] NSWCCA 285 at [36] (Simpson J).
	
	
	The applicant’s complaint is that the 2001 offence could not reasonably warrant withholding leniency to any significant degree. But as the Crown correctly submitted, it was perfectly reasonable for the judge to note this discrepancy in the applicant’s subjective case. The applicant’s subsequent offending in 2001 was plainly relevant when sentencing for the earlier offences, given that it was of a sexual nature not dissimilar to the earlier offences and, importantly, was also without explanation.
	
	
	As to the nature of the offences it is not in dispute that s 10 may properly be applied in respect of relatively serious offences in the circumstances of particular cases: see, for example, R v Paris [2001] NSWCCA 83 at [42]; Chin v Ryde City Council [2004] NSWCCA 167; 133 LGERA 312 at [38]; R v Mauger [2012] NSWCCA 51.
	
	
	However as Harrison J explained in R v Mauger at [19] (Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) and McCallum J agreeing), where the offence is an objectively serious one and where general deterrence and denunciation are important factors in sentencing for that offence, the scope of the operation of s 10 decreases. His Honour added that the focus of sentencing must be on the particular conduct of the offender and the circumstances of the offending rather than the nature of the offence: Walden v Hensler [1987] HCA 54; 163 CLR 561 at 577.
	
	
	Here the indecent assaults committed upon the 9 year old boy and 12 year old girl were not trivial offences. The applicant’s counsel did not contend otherwise. The judge properly focused on the particular conduct of the applicant and the circumstances of the offending, in determining whether to exercise the discretion not to record a conviction under s 10. The judge took into account in an appropriate manner, when sentencing for the principal offence, the additional offence on the Form 1: see Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [42]-[44]. 
	
	
	As to the applicant’s extenuating personal circumstances, his Honour found that the applicant as a 17 year old was “obviously immature” and a “very distressed and lonely” young man. Nonetheless, the nature of the offending, being an indecent assault committed upon a child, was a matter properly calling for denunciation and deterrence both general and specific, albeit the need for specific deterrence was mitigated by the applicant’s youth and his conduct (other than the 2001 offence) since the offences.
	
	
	It has been observed that sexual abuse of children will inevitability give rise to psychological damage: SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 255 at [52]. Here the victim impact statement revealed the damage the applicant had done to the male victim and the judge properly had regard to that matter in the exercise of his sentencing discretion, including consideration of s 10.
	
	
	Next, the applicant pointed to the delay in prosecution of the offences as being of particular significance in the present case: s 10(3)(d). It was contended that the offences were relatively “stale” and considerations of fairness to the applicant in his present situation warranted a dominant role in determining the sentence. Reference was made to R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519 (Street CJ); Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59; and R v DJS [2001] NSWCCA 189.
	
	
	The applicant placed reliance on R v DJS where no conviction was recorded, as supporting an understanding and flexibility in approach when sentencing in respect of “stale” offences. However as the Crown correctly pointed out, the factual circumstances in R v DJS differed significantly from the applicant’s case.
	
	
	In R v DJS, a 14 year old boy (20 years prior) removed his 8 year old sister’s underwear and momentarily touched her on the vagina whilst hiding in a wardrobe, and was caught by their mother who chastised him and took it no further. The sentencing judge described the incident as “at its highest, some form of a child experimenting in sexual activity”: R v DJS at [9]. Here the applicant’s offending is clearly more serious: the two victims were asleep in their own beds at night; they were awoken with a fright by the naked offender making skin-to-skin contact; in both incidents his penis was involved; he was almost 18, in a relationship with their older sister; and the offending was not merely some form of a child experimenting in some sexual activity.
	
	
	Moreover, his Honour did have regard to the long delay of 38 years. He expressly referred to the historical nature of the matter and the difficulties this presented to a sentencing exercise occurring many years later. Against this was his Honour’s finding, which is not challenged, that the applicant had not suffered the suspense and uncertainty over 38 years of what ultimately might happen to him, as he had no real memory of the offences. His Honour carefully weighed the significance of the delay in the present case.
	
	
	Finally, his Honour expressly recognised and took into account the potential consequences of a conviction for the applicant’s present employment and future prospects. Undoubtedly, this was one of the factors which weighed heavily in his Honour’s mind when recording that the sentencing exercise was a difficult matter. His Honour gave careful reasons why he imposed the sentence he did and why he rejected the applicant’s proposed option of a bond without recording a conviction.
	
	
	In my view, the sentence imposed on the applicant was clearly within the range of sentences which could be imposed.
	
	
	For these reasons, ground 2 has not been made out. There should however be a grant of leave to appeal, as ground 1 has been made out.
	


Is some other sentence warranted in law?


	
	Once error is established it becomes this Court’s duty to resentence unless in the exercise of its discretion it concludes that no sentence, whether more or less severe, is warranted and should have been passed: Kentwell v The Queen at [42].
	
	
	The Crown contended that if the Court concluded there was error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, then no lesser sentence is warranted in law taking into account the full range of factors affecting sentence: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant relied in this Court upon an affidavit from the applicant as to his circumstances post-sentence. Evidence of post-sentence conduct is admissible for the purpose of determining whether a sentence should be substituted under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act: Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 at [124] (Johnson J; McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J agreeing).
	
	
	The applicant’s affidavit addressed his likely employment prospects in the event of a conviction; his need to continue working because of his current financial circumstances, which he described as insecure and stressful; and his wish to relocate to Sydney to obtain work to be close to his elderly father and provide care to his father until he dies.
	
	
	I have had regard to the applicant’s subjective circumstances mentioned above.
	
	
	It is necessary to balance all these matters against the offending, taking into account the sentencing practices at that time.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant referred this Court to four cases involving what were said to be comparable offences, which in some instances were dealt with pursuant to s 83(3) of the Child Welfare Act. That is, without recording a conviction against the young person. Counsel frankly acknowledged that three of the cases were of no real assistance. Accordingly it is unnecessary to refer to them in any detail.
	
	
	It is sufficient to note that two of the cases were not sentencing decisions, but contained brief reference to sentences which had been imposed in the Children’s Court for historical indecent assaults. One involved a conviction in 1955: A v Commissioner, New South Wales Commission for Children and Young People [2000] NSWADT 151; the other involved an offence dealt with in 1972 and it was unclear whether the matter was dealt with under s 83(2) or (3) of the Child Welfare Act: R v Magrin [2004] NSWCA 354. The third case involved a serious sexual assault including physical violence. The offender was committed to an institution: R v McLeod (Supreme Court (NSW), Maxwell J, 21 March 1983, unrep).
	
	
	The fourth case contained the views of an experienced District Court judge (Finnane QC DCJ) concerning the likely disposition in the Children’s Court of indecent assault offences committed in 1967 by a young boy then aged 15½ years upon his four younger brothers. His Honour was sentencing the offender 40 years later: R v PL [2008] NSWDC 66. His Honour considered that the proper result in that case would have been a finding that the offence had been committed and that the magistrate would have ordered the release of the offender on probation (s 83(2)(a)), or he would have made a decision not to proceed to a finding of guilt and made an order dismissing the charge or admonishing and discharging the offender or discharging him conditionally on his entering a recognizance to be of good behaviour (s 83(3)).
	
	
	Nonetheless Finnane QC DCJ concluded in R v PL that it was not appropriate to find the offences proved and then dismiss them pursuant to s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. His Honour reasoned that acts of indecency committed against four separate victims, even though committed by a 15 year old boy, are serious offences and deserve to have some penalty imposed. Accordingly, his Honour convicted the offender of each offence but pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act imposed no other penalty.
	
	
	Here neither the sentencing judge nor this Court was provided with any materials which supported the sentencing practices of the Children’s Court under the s 83 of the Child Welfare Act in about 1976: cf Magnuson v R [2013] NSWCCA 50. As already mentioned, the applicant’s counsel frankly conceded that it is not possible to establish how that sentencing regime would have been applied at that time in the circumstances of the applicant’s case.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the Court is constrained to take a non-statistical approach which is described by Howie J (Fitzgerald JA agreeing) in R v Moon [2000] NSWCCA 534; 117 A Crim R 497 at [70]-[71], and approved in R v MJR at [107].  This requires consideration of “the nature of the criminal conduct proscribed by an offence and the maximum penalty applicable to the offence”: at [70].
	
	
	Howie J continued (at [70]) that “[e]ven after taking into account the subjective features of the offender and all the other matters relevant to sentencing, such as individual and general deterrence, the sentence imposed should reflect the objective seriousness of the offence: … and be proportional to the criminality involved in the offence committed” [citations omitted].
	
	
	The choice between sentencing options which this Court is confronted with is whether to find the offence proved without proceeding to a conviction and impose a good behaviour bond pursuant to s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, or to convict the applicant and impose a good behaviour bond under s 9.
	
	
	The Crown did not challenge the judge’s finding as to the objective seriousness of the principal offence being well below mid-range. Nonetheless the act of indecency committed against the 9 year old boy by the applicant aged 17½ year old was a serious offence and, in my view, deserves to have some penalty imposed.
	
	
	I have taken into account the nature of the offending against the young boy and the maximum penalty at that time (imprisonment for 5 years), as well as the Form 1 offence. General deterrence and denunciation remain important matters in the sentencing task, notwithstanding the long delay in the prosecution.
	
	
	I have also taken into account the factors favouring not recording a conviction including: the applicant’s youth, his difficult childhood, the long delay and the likely effect of a conviction on the applicant’s present and future employment prospects. I consider that the 2001 offence warrants withholding, to some degree, the leniency to be extended to the applicant in light of his youth.
	
	
	In my judgment exercising the sentencing discretion afresh, an appropriate sentence is that the applicant be convicted of the offence and ordered to enter into a good behaviour bond, pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, for a period of two years from 20 June 2014 and otherwise on the same terms as imposed for by the sentencing judge. It follows that I am not persuaded that a lesser sentence is warranted in law.
	


Conclusion


	
	There should be a grant of leave to appeal as an error in the sentencing process has been made out by ground 1. Nonetheless, I am not persuaded that a lesser sentence is warranted in law. Accordingly, I propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Grant leave to appeal.

(2)   Appeal dismissed.


	
	ROTHMAN J: I agree with Gleeson JA.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I agree with Gleeson JA.

		02 February 2016",2016-02-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2768682,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 16) [2016] NSWSC 20,"Judgment – EX TEMPORE (REVISED)


	
	Prior to the commencement of proceedings this morning I was advised by the Sheriff that an officer of her Department had been approached by a man who identified himself as Mr Buckingham-Jones, a journalist from “The Australian” newspaper. I was advised that Mr Buckingham-Jones informed the Sheriff that he was acquainted with one of the jurors. I directed the Sheriff to obtain some further information for me as to the nature and extent of that relationship so that I could better appraise counsel of the situation which had arisen.
	
	
	As a consequence of those inquiries that I directed be made, I was informed by the Sheriff that Mr Buckingham-Jones and the juror had, through a family association, known each other for some 23 years. The name of the juror was made known to me, as was her number.
	
	
	The transcript will reflect that I appraised counsel of this information upon commencing the proceedings this morning, following which Mr Buckingham-Jones was called to give evidence. He confirmed that he was employed as a journalist at “The Australian” newspaper and that he had been directed by his superiors to file reports in relation to this trial. He said that he had been given that direction yesterday morning (2 February) as a consequence of which he attended court. Upon entering, he immediately recognised a member of the jury. He was not present when the jury was empanelled on the morning of 1 February.
	
	
	Mr Buckingham-Jones confirmed that he had known the juror for his entire life and described their relationship as one which was ""reasonably close"". He explained that they both attended the same church and that their respective families had been ""reasonably close friends"" for 23 years. He said that he spoke with the juror ""perhaps once a fortnight"" and that prior to the commencement of this trial she had indicated to him that she had been issued with a jury summons. In answer to a question put by the Crown Prosecutor, Mr Buckingham-Jones said that the juror had not made him aware of any further details regarding the summons and that they had not discussed anything about either of the accused, nor anything about this trial. He also confirmed that he did not report on the previous trial.
	
	
	In answer to questions from Ms Shead of counsel who appears for the accused Mr McNamara, Mr Buckingham-Jones confirmed that he was present in court all day yesterday. He said that he had no eye contact with the juror, and that upon recognising her, he specifically avoided such contact. He also confirmed that he filed a story yesterday in relation to the trial and that it was published in today's edition of “The Australian”. It is unclear whether or not it appeared in the online or the print editions of that publication but, for present purposes, that probably does not matter.
	
	
	Following Mr Buckingham-Jones' evidence I gave the Crown and counsel for each of the accused the opportunity to obtain instructions as to what course should be taken. Neither the Crown nor Mr Thomas, who appears for the accused Rogerson, made any application. However, Ms Shead made application that the juror be discharged. She cited, in support of that application, the juror’s obvious (and close) personal and social relationship with Mr Buckingham-Jones. She also pointed to the fact that Mr Buckingham-Jones has reported on the trial and emphasised that this was a trial which has attracted, and will continue to attract, significant media interest. The effect of Ms Shead's submissions was that there was an attendant risk in allowing that situation to continue, for fear that some discussion might take place between the juror and Mr Buckingham-Jones in the course of the trial.
	
	
	Despite the fact that there was some delay in bringing the matter to my attention, no blame can be cast at the feet of either Mr Buckingham-Jones, or the juror, for the situation which has arisen. During the course of submissions this morning, I received a note from the juror (MFI 3) drawing my attention to the fact that she had recognised a member of the media in court yesterday. Both Mr Buckingham-Jones, and the juror have acted responsibly in bringing the matter to my attention.
	
	
	Whilst I have no reason to think that the juror and Mr Buckingham-Jones are unaware of their respective responsibilities, it is an undesirable situation to allow the juror to remain, in circumstances where she has a close personal association with a journalist who may report on aspects of the trial, and in circumstances where the trial will continue to attract significant publicity. I am obviously not able to prevent the juror and Mr Buckingham-Jones from associating with one another during the months over which the trial will be conducted. It goes without saying that all parties in this case are entitled to a fair trial. Anything which may have the capacity to impinge upon that right is an obviously serious matter. A total of 15 jurors were selected in light of the fact that the trial is expected to take at least 3 months, and possibly longer, to complete. We are presently at day 3. There will be significant media publicity for the duration of the trial. For all of these reasons, it is my view that the appropriate course is to discharge the juror and proceed with a jury of 14.
	
	
	After I had expressed that conclusion, Ms Shead made a further application that I discharge the entire jury on the basis of the possibility of “contamination”. In my view, there is no warrant whatsoever for making an order that the entire jury be discharged. Accepting, as I do, that the evidence of Mr Buckingham-Jones is truthful, he has not engaged in any conversation with the juror in question about the trial. In these circumstances it is difficult, to say the least, to envisage the possibility of any contamination of the other 14 members of the jury as a consequence of the events which have arisen. On the evidence before me, the most that the juror in question could have shared with her fellow jurors is the fact that she recognised a member of the media in court with whom she has a close personal friendship. That falls substantially short of the evidence which would be required to conclude that the entire jury should be discharged. For these reasons I do not propose to accede to Ms Shead's application.
	
	
	The formal orders that I make will be as follows:
	



	
	Juror number 650-14 is discharged.
	
	
	The trial will proceed with the remaining 14persons who have been empanelled.
	



	
	When the proceedings resume with those 14 persons I will explain to them, in obviously broad terms, what has happened and will direct them as to the necessity to refrain from any speculation as to why I have taken the course that I have taken.

		15 June 2016",2016-02-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768700,R v Dent [2016] NSWSC 99,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: On 1 February 2016 I heard submissions on the objection by the accused to the Crown's proposal to adduce tendency and coincidence evidence. On 4 February I ruled that the evidence was inadmissible. The following are the reasons for that ruling.
	


Overview of prosecution case


	
	The accused, Anthony Richard Dent, was charged with the murder of Anthony O'Grady at Wickham, an inner city suburb of Newcastle, on or about 25 March 2014. He was also charged with robbery in company inflicting grievous bodily harm upon Mr O'Grady. Both charges arose from the one incident.
	
	
	Briefly, the Crown alleges that Mr Dent, in a joint criminal enterprise with his co-accused RC and JM, and one Jeffrey Schott, committed a planned robbery of Mr O'Grady in the course of which Mr Dent seriously assaulted him causing fatal blunt force trauma. Mr O'Grady was a 52 year-old man who was known to have wealth. In the late afternoon of 25 March 2014 a plan was discussed between the four men to entice Mr O'Grady to go to Wickham Park where he would be robbed.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that once Mr O'Grady was in the park, the accused Dent struck him causing him to fall to the ground. Mr Dent hit him further and then started to take his pants off. He removed Mr O'Grady's underwear and used it to gag him. Rope was used to bind his hands to his feet behind him. The Crown alleges that Mr Dent removed Mr O'Grady's house and car keys from his pockets and threw them to JM, telling him to go to Mr O'Grady's house and take his car and belongings. JM, RC and Schott then left the park.
	
	
	Sometime later Mr Dent went to an ATM where he attempted unsuccessfully to withdraw funds from Mr O'Grady's bank account. Subsequent telephone contact indicated that Mr Dent intended to return to the park to obtain Mr O'Grady's correct PIN. Sometime after that, Mr Dent communicated by telephone to the effect that Mr O'Grady was ""gone"".
	
	
	Mr O'Grady's body was discovered in the park the following morning and a police investigation commenced. The accused Dent was arrested on 21 April 2014. He made no admissions. DNA consistent with being his was found inside one of Mr O'Grady's pockets, on his underpants, on rope that was used to bind him and on the waist band of his shorts.
	
	
	The autopsy examination revealed that Mr O'Grady sustained a large number of injuries. They included:
	


1.   Marked facial congestion with poorly defined areas of facial bruising.

2.    Intra-oral bruising with laceration at left angle of mouth.

3.   Scalp haemorrhage on right forehead and left temporal region.

4.    Acute right subdural haematoma.

5.    Multiple areas of circular bruising on right and left upper limbs (fingertip bruises).


	
	The immediate cause of death was a large acute right subdural haematoma. There was evidence of bruising to the scalp and face, indicative of blunt force trauma. The pathologist opined that the deceased likely suffered a number of blows to the face and head. The presence of a gag in the mouth was likely to have caused a degree of asphyxiation contributing to death. Being bound and lying face down would have further restricted his capacity to breath.
	


The proposed tendency and coincidence evidence


	
	The Crown gave notice of its intention to adduce tendency and coincidence evidence pursuant to ss 97 and 98 respectively of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (""the Act"").
	
	
	Section 97, relevantly, is in the following terms:
	


""97 The tendency rule

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

…""


	
	Section 98, relevantly, is in the following terms:
	


""98 The coincidence rule

(1) Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

Note. One of the events referred to in subsection (1) may be an event the occurrence of which is a fact in issue in the proceeding.

…""


	
	The provisions of s 101 are important:
	


101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. …


	
	The Crown gave notice in writing of its intention to adduce the evidence by letters to the accused's solicitor of 24 November 2015. No issue was raised as to the reasonableness of such notice, or with the sufficiency of compliance with the provisions of cls 5 and 6 respectively of the Evidence Regulation 2015 (NSW).
	
	
	The tendency of the accused that the Crown sought to prove is:
	


""his/her [sic] tendency to act in a particular way, namely

● to assault males

● to inflict serious injuries upon those males

● to take property from those males

● to do so in and around public parks in Mayfield

or to have a particular state of mind, namely

● To intentionally inflict grievous bodily harm upon others"".


	
	The ""2 or more events"" the subject of the coincidence issue are said to be:
	


""Anthony Richard Dent assaulting Ronald Hamilton and Allan Charles Sichter thereby inflicting fatal injuries to them, and taking property from them, near Passmore Oval Mayfield on 20 October 1977""

and

""Anthony Richard Dent assaulting Anthony O'Grady inflicting fatal injuries and taking property from him near Passmore Oval Mayfield on 25 March 2014"".


	
	The coincidence evidence was tendered to prove that the accused Dent:
	


""(D)id a particular act, namely

● Did assault Anthony O'Grady with an intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm on 25 March 2014

● Did rob Anthony O'Grady of property on 25 March 2014

or had a particular state of mind, namely

● To assault Anthony O'Grady with an intention of at least inflicting grievous bodily harm.""


	
	The substance of the evidence in each case was that on the evening of 20 October 1977 Mr Dent, then 17 years of age, assaulted two men near Passmore Oval at Wickham and took $50 off them. The evidence comprises admissions he made to this effect to some young men at a pool hall at about 10.30pm on 20 October 1977: for example, ""I just bashed an old drunkie and I got fifty dollars off him … I went up and bashed another two [sic]"". He was seen to be in possession of cash amounting to, or approximating, $50. He was breathing heavily as if he had been running and was rubbing his hand, complaining of having a sore knuckle.
	
	
	The men to whom these admissions were made went to the scene and came across the two victims who were apparently dead. When the accused was told of their observations he said that he did not believe them.
	
	
	Following his arrest the next afternoon the accused made admissions to police of having been in a fight with two men he had chanced upon but he claimed that they had accosted him and he acted in self-defence. One of the men had his pants down but that was because he had been masturbating. The fight was ""a very hard one"" and he fought back ""heavily"". He claimed that the men were alive when he left them each lying on the ground. He had only used his fists and did not strike them after they went to the ground. He admitted having been in possession of about $50 that evening but claimed that it was the proceeds of his social security benefits.
	
	
	At the hearing of the application the Crown tendered the report of the post-mortem examination of the bodies of the two deceased. It is clear that they sustained substantial and widespread injuries. Mr Hamilton's cause of death was ""haemorrhage due to traumatic rupture of the heart"" and ""multiple skeletal fractures"" (for example, it appeared his chest wall had been trodden on or more likely jumped on and virtually all ribs were fractured). Mr Sichter's cause of death was ""fractured neck and larynx"" and ""internal haemorrhage"" with the pathologist's opinion being that ""considerable force"" was used.
	
	
	The Crown also tendered the accused's criminal record which shows that he was convicted for the murder of the two men, thereby indicating that his claim to police that he was acting in self-defence must have failed (if it was relied upon) and also that it must have been established that he had an intention (at least) to inflict grievous bodily harm.
	


Submissions


	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor sought to identify a number of similarities between the events in Wickham Park in 1977 and in 2014. The deceased in 2014 was found within 50 metres of where the bodies of the two men were found in 1977. Both incidents occurred at about 8.00pm. Each victim was known to be a person who drank a great deal and they were all aged in their fifties. Both cases involved a considerable deal of unarmed violence. All three men were left alive but died because of their injuries. The motive to rob in each case was to obtain money. It was also asserted to be of significance that it was the accused's idea to lure Mr O'Grady to Wickham Park, the very place where he had murdered before.
	
	
	As to the lengthy period intervening between the two events (37 years), the Crown Prosecutor sought to distinguish R v Watkins [2005] NSWCCA 164; 153 A Crim R 434 where it was held that events that occurred 15 years previously that bore some similarity with the events in question were not admissible as tendency and coincidence evidence. The intervening period in which there had been no similar conduct was regarded as of significance in diminishing the probative value of tendency evidence. The basis of the distinction was said to be that for most of the intervening period in the present case the accused had been in custody serving various sentences of imprisonment.
	
	
	For the reason that homicide is a crime of comparative rarity (tendency evidence is most often tendered in trials for more commonly encountered crimes like sexual assault) it was submitted that the similarities between the two events enhanced the probative value of the evidence: ""the tendency to erupt violently and to kill perhaps unsuspecting victims in an outburst of violence with only the weapon of his own body, his hands and knees and feet, this is a tendency which must be regarded as extremely unusual in the community, even among those who commit homicide"".
	
	
	As to the possible prejudicial effect, it was acknowledged that ""a jury would then come to know that the accused has killed before"" but it was submitted that ""the only way that a jury would be able to use that evidence is as evidence that the accused has a tendency to act that way in those circumstances and that he is likely to have acted that way in similar circumstances regardless of them having happened so many years later"".
	
	
	The primary submission of Mr Austin, counsel for the accused, was that the time that had elapsed since 1977 robbed the evidence of having any, or at least significant, probative value. The majority of his submissions were devoted to speculation about what might be the position if one or both of the accused's then co-accused were to give evidence, either in their own defence or if they were to plead guilty and give evidence for the prosecution. I determined upon my ruling at a time when that situation was still somewhat up in the air and it played no part in my reasoning. As it happened, both of them have become prosecution witnesses but this has no bearing upon the question in any event.
	


Determination


	
	The recent judgment in Hughes v R [2015] NSWCCA 330 provides a useful summary of the case law on the subject of tendency evidence (at [158] ff) and I had regard to the various principles set out therein.
	
	
	In assessing the potential probative value of the evidence it is necessary to bear in mind that the purpose for which the Crown seeks to adduce it is to provide a foundation for an inference that the accused was more likely to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, on the occasion in question.
	
	
	Assuming the evidence concerning the events in 1977 was accepted by the jury, how confidently could the inference be drawn from it that the accused had a tendency to assault males in and around public parks in Mayfield, inflicting serious injuries upon, and taking property from, them? Similarly, how confidently could the inference be drawn from it that the accused had a tendency to intend to inflict grievous bodily harm upon others?
	
	
	In my view the answer is that the support for such inferences is not very strong at all. On the limited evidence that the Crown proposes to place before the jury (the criminal record is not to be tendered), it would be known that the accused acted in an extremely violent way towards two men and intended to inflict at least grievous bodily harm upon them in 1977 when he was a 17 year old youth. The jury would infer that the accused probably spent some time in gaol but they would not know anything about what he had done in the balance of the intervening period except that the Crown was not suggesting that he had been involved in any violent conduct in gaol or subsequently.
	
	
	Whilst there are some similarities between the two incidents as the Crown Prosecutor identified, the number, nature and distinctiveness of similarities are not determinative. What is in issue is the capacity of the evidence to establish that the accused had a tendency to act in a particular way, or to have a state of mind. The Crown case here is that the accused acted in a particular way, and had a particular state of mind, on a single occasion and it is contended that this would establish tendencies that he had to do so, and to think so, some 37 years later on 25 March 2014.
	
	
	The fact that the accused was not shown to have behaved or thought in a similar way for such a lengthy period of time dilutes the probative force of the tendency evidence to such a degree that it cannot be said that there is significant probative value. Moreover, the conclusion can be easily reached that such probative value that the evidence may have does not outweigh the potential prejudicial effect. It would be very difficult to give effective directions to the jury not to give inappropriate weight to evidence that the accused had killed before.
	
	
	The Crown's submissions seemed to be entirely devoted to tendency evidence but it had also served a coincidence evidence notice and considerable focus was upon the various asserted similarities so I will deal with it briefly.
	
	
	Some of the similarities referred to by the Crown were of no real significance. For example, the fact that Mr O'Grady was aged in his 50s and so too were the two unfortunate gentlemen in 1977 is just happenstance. There was no suggestion of the accused selecting victims on the basis of their age. The fact that each man was left alive but died later is of no moment. (I doubt the Crown would say its argument would be weaker if one had died immediately and others not until later.)
	
	
	The use of a considerable degree of violence in each case is of little significance. Most homicides involving unarmed violence would. A motive to rob is of some significance but not terribly much.
	
	
	On the other hand, the fact that, on the Crown case, the accused chose to have Mr O'Grady lured to Wickham Park where he had committed the murders in 1977 is of significance. It would have been more convenient to lure him to a closer more convenient location. But this asserted similarity says very little (if at all) about whether the accused acted with an intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm once at the park.
	
	
	Even looking at the combined effect of the asserted similarities, I was not persuaded that there was significant probative value when considering the evidence as coincidence as opposed to tendency evidence.
	


Conclusion


	
	As both tendency evidence and coincidence evidence I was not persuaded that there was significant probative value. For these reasons, the evidence of Mr Dent having murdered two men in 1977 was excluded.

		19 February 2016",2016-02-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768716,R v A2; R v Magennis; R v Vaziri (No. 22) [2016] NSWSC 73,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: This judgment concerns the question of whether a non-publication order, presently in place under the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010 (“CSNO Act”), should continue. The non-publication order relates to KM.
	
	
	KM was charged in 2012 with offences of female genital mutilation contrary to s.45 Crimes Act 1900. Ultimately she stood trial at a trial commencing in September 2015, together with two other persons, A2 and Shabbir Vaziri. KM and A2 were convicted of two offences each under s.45 Crimes Act 1900. Mr Vaziri was convicted of being an accessory after the fact to those offences.
	
	
	On 7 August 2014, a Judge of the District Court made a non-publication order preventing the publication of KM's name and any information tending to reveal her identity. That order was based upon evidence placed before the Court concerning events which had arisen after she had been charged, including conduct which gave rise to a level of harassment and the adverse impact of those matters on her health. I should note that KM is now 72 years old.
	
	
	The matter was then in the District Court following committal for trial, but the various charges were removed to this Court by order of the Chief Justice under s.128 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The non-publication order was continued by Fullerton J in the Arraignment List on 3 October 2014. The matters came before me on a number of occasions in 2015, both at the pretrial and trial stages.
	
	
	On 9 September 2015, following an indication from me that the issue of the non-publication order ought be examined prior to the trial, further evidence was provided by counsel for KM. That evidence confirmed, in a number of respects, that KM’s health difficulties continued, and that the adverse impact of publication of her name may well impact upon the conduct of the trial itself. The Crown did not oppose the order remaining in place at that time. I took the view, on the basis of the evidence, that the order should remain in place. Of course, KM at that time had pleaded not guilty and the matters had not proceeded to trial.
	
	
	On 12 November 2015, KM was convicted, together with the other accused persons, of the primary charges brought against them, in her case under s.45 Crimes Act 1900. The sentencing hearing has commenced today and is to continue at a later date.
	
	
	In advance of this hearing, I invited the parties to make submissions with respect to the non-publication order in what are now the changed circumstances arising from the conviction by the jury of KM. Written submissions have been made by Mr Bouveng of counsel for KM (MFI 3 on sentence) and affidavits of KM and her husband have been received on the question of the continuation of the non-publication order (Exhibits 1 and 2 on sentence).
	
	
	The Court is urged to continue the non-publication order on the bases identified in the submissions and the evidence, namely, the continuing concerns on the part of KM with respect to potential harassment and impact upon her health.
	
	
	The Crown has submitted today that the verdicts of the jury have changed the position and that the appropriate course is to lift the non-publication order. The Crown submitted that any difficulties which may arise, from publication of the name of KM, are capable of being dealt with by the operation of aspects of the civil and criminal law.
	
	
	The order in question was made under the CSNO Act. As Mr Bouveng rightly points out, there is nothing in that Act that says, with respect to criminal proceedings, that the conviction of a person by a jury is a statutory factor to be taken into account.
	
	
	In this case, the order is sought to be maintained by reference to s.8(1)(a) and (c) CSNO Act. Those provisions allow a court to make a suppression order or non-publication order on grounds including that the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice and the order is necessary to protect the safety of any person.
	
	
	Those considerations led to the making of the order originally in the District Court and its continuation up to verdict. It is important to keep in mind, however, that s.6 CSNO Act requires a court, in deciding whether to make a non-publication order, to take into account that a primary objective of the administration of justice is to safeguard the public interest in open justice.
	
	
	It was submitted by Mr Bouveng that the continuation of the non-publication order will not cause a difficulty with open justice. There has been an ability to publish all the circumstances of the trial and what KM was charged with and found guilty of, with her name and anything that would identify her being the only areas which are prohibited.
	
	
	In my view, the open justice principle, in the context of the criminal justice system, extends not only to the evidence which is given but to the identity of the accused, certainly once an accused person is found guilty. The presumption of innocence has been displaced by the verdict or verdicts of the jury.
	
	
	That is not to say that the CSNO Act can have no application at all, or that publication of the name of every convicted person must be allowed. There are, of course, exceptions to this, such as a juvenile who is found guilty (s.15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1986), or a person who is found guilty by a jury but who happens to be someone assisting the authorities and who is going to gaol, as to which there are concerns that would likely fall within the terms of s.8(1)(a) and/or (c) CSNO Act.
	
	
	There is no hard and fast rule. However, it does seem to me that what is necessary now, as part of the balancing exercise in deciding whether this order should continue, is to have regard to the fundamentally different position in which KM now stands.
	
	
	It is the unhappy fact that many persons convicted of offences suffer some public opprobrium and that factor itself may, in an appropriate case, be taken into account on sentence. The difficulties which have been experienced by KM and her husband, with respect to potential public opprobrium, are not ones which point forcefully towards the maintenance of the non-publication order. As the Crown submits, if it be that there is conduct by anyone which gives rise to an interference with the lawful rights of KM, then the law may be called in aid.
	
	
	I have taken into account the affidavits from 2014, 2015 and 1 February 2016. I have considered whether the Court is in a position to conclude that it is necessary that a non-publication order continue in this case. As I have said, an informed consideration, in making that assessment now, has regard to the changed position of KM as a convicted person, and the operation of the open justice principle in the criminal justice system with respect to persons in the position of a convicted person.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the appropriate course is to lift the non-publication order which has been in place now since 2014. Accordingly, I direct that the non-publication order made in 2014, and continued a number of times since, be lifted.
	
	
	In taking that course, I emphasise that any publicity which may attach to these proceedings should involve a fair report of the proceedings, in circumstances where submissions have been made today with respect to aspects of the case. The media will be in a position to exercise that function, no doubt in a responsible fashion.
	
	
	The non-publication order previously attaching to Kubra Magennis is lifted.

2768726,Potier v Parole Authority of NSW [2016] NSWSC 39,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	Malcolm Potier, the plaintiff, was granted parole on 2 October 2015, to be released no earlier than 16 October 2015 and no later than 23 October 2015. Upon his release, he was taken to immigration detention. On 15 December 2015 he was removed to the United Kingdom. He seeks, by summons and a notice of motion filed on 12 November 2015, relief that includes a declaration that the parole order was invalid and that he ought, accordingly, be returned to custody and remain incarcerated in a gaol in New South Wales unless and until he applies for parole and it is granted, or the term of his sentence expires.
	
	
	The named defendants are:
	



	
	The first defendant: the NSW State Parole Authority (the Parole Authority);
	
	
	The second defendant: the Minister, Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the Minister); and
	
	
	The third defendant: the New South Wales Commissioner, Department of Correctional Services (the Commissioner).
	



	
	As the first and second defendants filed submitting appearances, the Commissioner was the only active defendant in these proceedings.
	
	
	The principal relief sought is contained in prayers 1 and 2 of the notice of motion, as follows:
	



	
	[a declaration] that the plaintiff has not been released on parole at law.
	
	
	[an order] that the second defendant return the plaintiff to the ongoing custody of the third defendant and thereafter be dealt with according to law.
	


The relevant legislative provisions


	
	In order to understand the context in which the claim for relief arises, it is necessary to set out the relevant legislative provisions which govern the grant of parole and the removal from Australia of non-citizens.
	


Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW)


	
	Section 2A of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Act) provides for objects which include the following:
	


“(a) to ensure that those offenders who are required to be held in custody are removed from the general community and placed in a safe, secure and humane environment,

. . .

(d) to provide for the rehabilitation of offenders with a view to their reintegration into the general community.”


	
	Part 6 of the Act makes provision for parole. Section 125 provides that Part 6 applies to an offender who is serving a sentence by way of full-time detention. Section 126 provides:
	


“126 Eligibility for release on parole

(1) Offenders may be released on parole in accordance with this Part.

(2) An offender is eligible for release on parole only if:

(a) the offender is subject to at least one sentence for which a non-parole period has been set, and

(b) the offender has served the non-parole period of each such sentence and is not subject to any other sentence.

(3) Nothing in this Part authorises the release of an offender who is required to be kept in custody in relation to an offence against a law of the Commonwealth.

(4) An offender is not eligible for release on parole if the offender is the subject of a continuing detention order, an interim detention order or an emergency detention order under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006.”


	
	Section 127 of the Act provides that an offender who is eligible for release may not be released on parole except in accordance with a parole order directing his or her release. A “parole order” is relevantly defined to include an order under s 138 (see below): s 3 of the Act.
	
	
	Section 133 of the Act provides that a parole order is not invalid merely because of a failure by the Parole Authority to comply with any procedural requirement imposed by or under the Act.
	
	
	Division 2 makes provision for sentences in excess of 3 years. Section 135(1) prohibits the Parole Authority from making a parole order unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities that the release of the offender is “appropriate in the public interest”. Section 135(2) sets out a number of mandatory relevant considerations to be taken into account by the Parole Authority in deciding that question. These include the need to protect the safety of the community and the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice.
	
	
	Section 135A provides for the preparation of reports by the Probation and Parole Service and sets out the matters to be addressed in such reports. There is no reference in that section to the desire (or otherwise) of the offender to be released on parole.
	
	
	Subdivision 3 of Division 2 (which contains ss 136-141) applies to offenders other than serious offenders and, accordingly, has no direct application in the present case. However, it will be considered for completeness since it is a cardinal principle of interpretation that an Act must be read as a whole.
	
	
	Section 138(1) provides that, as soon as practicable after deciding to release an offender on parole, the Parole Authority must make an order directing that an offender be released on parole. Section 138(1AA) provides:
	


“(1AA) The period to be specified in a parole order under this section is to be:

(a) if the order is made earlier than the offender’s parole eligibility date (other than an order made following consideration of the offender’s case under section 137B [the equivalent of s 143B]), a period beginning no earlier than the offender’s parole eligibility date and ending no later than 35 days after that date, and

(a1) if the order is made following an application by the offender referred to in section 137A [the equivalent of s 143A], and is made before the offender’s annual review date (within the meaning of that section), a period beginning no earlier than the offender’s annual review date and ending no later than 35 days after that date, and

(b) in any other case, a period beginning no earlier than the date on which the order is made and ending no later than 35 days after that date.”


	
	Subdivision 3 of Division 2 applies to serious offenders. Section 143, which is contained in Subdivision 3, obliges the Parole Authority to consider whether or not a serious offender (which relevantly includes Mr Potier) should be released on parole at least 60 days before the offender’s parole eligibility date, which is relevantly defined as the date on which the offender first becomes eligible for release on parole. Section 143A relevantly provides:
	


“143A Consideration of parole in subsequent years

(1) At any time within 90 days before an offender’s annual review date, the offender, if still eligible for release on parole, may apply to be released on parole.

(1A) For the purposes of this section, an “offender’s annual review date” occurs on each anniversary of the offender’s parole eligibility date.

(2) After receiving such an application, but not more than 60 days before the offender’s annual review date, the Parole Authority must consider whether or not the offender should be released on parole.

(3) Despite subsection (2):

(a) if the offender is unlawfully at large following revocation of parole, the Parole Authority is not required to consider the offender’s case until the offender is returned to custody, and

(b) if the offender is unlawfully at large for the whole of one or more years following the revocation, the Parole Authority may decline to consider the offender’s case at all in relation to that year or those years, and

(c) in any case, the Parole Authority may decline to consider an offender’s case for up to 3 years at a time after it last considered the grant of parole to the offender.”


	
	Under s 143B of the Act the Parole Authority is entitled to consider a serious offender’s case at any time after the offender first becomes eligible for parole in circumstances prescribed to constitute manifest injustice. It was not suggested that any of the circumstances prescribed applied in the present case. Sections 143A and 143B were inserted into the Act in 2004. Their purpose is addressed below when the legislative history of Part 6 is considered as an aid to its interpretation.
	
	
	Section 144 requires the Parole Authority, after giving its preliminary consideration to release of a serious offender on parole, to form and record its initial intention.
	
	
	Section 148 sets out the principles on which the Parole Authority’s final decision is to be made in the following terms:
	


“148 Principles on which Parole Authority’s final decision to be made

(1) The Parole Authority is to make its final decision as to whether or not to make a parole order on the following principles:

(a) that the Parole Authority will confirm its initial intention to make a parole order if there are no submissions to the contrary or if it is not required to seek victim submissions,

(b) that the Parole Authority will reconsider its initial intention to make a parole order if there are submissions to the contrary, and will in that event take into account any offender submissions,

(c) that the Parole Authority will confirm its initial intention not to make a parole order if there are no offender submissions,

(d) that the Parole Authority will reconsider its initial intention not to make a parole order if there are offender submissions, and will in that event take into account any other submissions.

(2) The Parole Authority must consider all submissions made in accordance with this Subdivision and, subject to section 185 (2), must disregard all other submissions.”


	
	Section 149 provides for a decision following a review of the Parole Authority’s initial intention. Section 150 provides for a decision where there is no review.
	
	
	Section 151(1) (which corresponds to s 138, but applies to serious offenders) provides:
	


“151 Release of serious offender on parole

(1) The period to be specified in a parole order under section 149 or 150 is to be:

(a) if the order is made earlier than 14 days before the offender’s parole eligibility date (other than an order made following consideration of the offender’s case under section 143B), a period beginning no earlier than the offender’s parole eligibility date and ending no later than 21 days after that date, and

(a1) if the order is made following an application by the offender referred to in section 143A, and is made before the offender’s annual review date (within the meaning of that section), a period beginning no earlier than the offender’s annual review date and ending no later than 35 days after that date, and

(b) in any other case, a period beginning no earlier than 14 days after the date on which the order is made and ending no later than 35 days after that date.”


	
	The Serious Offenders Review Council (SORC) is constituted by s 195 of the Act. One of SORC’s functions is to “provide reports and advice to the Parole Authority concerning the release on parole of serious offenders”: s 197(2)(b). Pursuant to s 198(2A), SORC is obliged to consider the following matters when exercising its functions under s 197(2)(b):
	


“(a) the public interest,

(b) the offender’s classification history,

(c) the offender’s conduct while in custody, both in relation to sentences currently being served and in relation to earlier sentences,

(d) the offender’s willingness to participate in rehabilitation programs, and the success or otherwise of his or her participation in such programs,

(e) any relevant reports (including any medical, psychiatric or psychological reports) that are available to the Review Council in relation to the offender,

(f) any other matter that the Review Council considers to be relevant.”

Migration Act 1958 (Cth)


	
	Section 14 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) provides that a non-citizen in the migration zone who is not a lawful non-citizen is an unlawful non-citizen. Section 189(1) provides that, if an officer knows or reasonably suspects that a person in the migration zone (which relevantly includes New South Wales) is an unlawful non-citizen, the officer must detain the person. Section 196(1) relevantly provides that an unlawful non-citizen detained under s 189 must be kept in immigration detention until he or she is removed from Australia under s 198. Section 198 requires officers to remove unlawful non-citizens from Australia “as soon as reasonably practicable”.
	
	
	Part 2 of the Migration Act provides for “Arrival, presence and departure of persons”. Division 4 of Part 2 is entitled “Criminal justice visitors”. The object of the Division is set out in s 141, which provides:
	


“141 Object of Division

This Division is enacted so that, if the administration of criminal justice requires the presence in Australia of a non-citizen, that non-citizen may be brought to, or allowed to stay in, Australia for the purposes of that administration.”


	
	Section 142 includes within the definition of “administration of criminal justice” “the punishment by way of imprisonment of a person for the commission of an offence”. Section 145 relevantly provides that if the Attorney-General considers that the temporary presence in Australia of a non-citizen who is outside Australia is required for the purposes of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth), the Attorney-General may give a certificate that the presence of the non-citizen in Australia is required for the administration of criminal justice.
	
	
	Section 148(1) of the Migration Act provides:
	


“State criminal justice stay certificate 

(1) If:

(a) an unlawful non-citizen is to be, or is likely to be, removed or deported; and

(b) an authorised official for a State considers that the non-citizen should remain in Australia temporarily for the purposes of the administration of criminal justice in relation to an offence against a law of the State; and

(c) that authorised official considers that satisfactory arrangements have been made to make sure that the person or organisation who wants the non-citizen for those purposes or the non-citizen or both will meet the cost of keeping the non-citizen in Australia;

the official may give a certificate that the stay of the non-citizen's removal or deportation is required for the administration of criminal justice by the State.”


	
	Section 150 of the Migration Act provides that if a criminal justice stay certificate about a non-citizen is in force, the non-citizen is not to be removed or deported.
	
	
	Section 151 of the Migration Act provides:
	


“Certain warrants stay removal or deportation 

(1) If an unlawful non-citizen is to be, or is likely to be, removed or deported, this Act does not prevent a court issuing for the purposes of the administration of criminal justice in relation to an offence against a law a warrant to stay the removal or deportation.

(2) If a criminal justice stay warrant about a non-citizen is in force, the non-citizen is not to be removed or deported.

(3) If a court issues a criminal justice stay warrant about a non-citizen, the applicant for the warrant is responsible for the costs of any maintenance or accommodation (other than immigration detention) of the non-citizen while the warrant is in force.”

Extradition Act 1988 (Cth)


	
	Section 40 of the Extradition Act provides:
	


“Requests for surrender of persons to Australia 

A request by Australia for the surrender of a person from a country (other than New Zealand) in relation to an offence against a law of Australia of which the person is accused or of which the person has been convicted shall only be made by or with the authority of the Attorney-General.”

The facts


	
	On 7 August 2006 Mr Potier was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a period of 12 years expiring on 6 August 2018 with a non-parole period of 7 years, following his conviction on a charge of solicit to murder contrary to s 25 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Accordingly, his parole eligibility date was 6 August 2013.
	
	
	On 30 April 2013 SORC prepared an initial report pursuant to ss 197 and 198 of the Act. It advised against the Authority considering Mr Potier’s release on parole, in part on the basis that he proposed to seek custody of his sixteen-year old daughter if released to parole. At its initial meeting on 7 June 2013 the Parole Authority formed the initial intention to refuse parole. Mr Potier applied for a review hearing, which was refused by the Authority. The Parole Authority refused to order parole on 6 August 2013.
	
	
	On 12 March 2014 Mr Potier was interviewed at Junee Correctional Centre by an Assessment Committee of SORC. Notes of the interview included the following paragraphs:
	


“The Committee [an Assessment Committee of SORC] noted the NPP [non-parole period] expired 6 August 2013, the inmate advised that he did not apply for parole. . .

The inmate clarified that he has not applied for parole and is aware that his parole is reviewed as a statutory obligation, every 12 months. The inmate will decide in the future if he wishes to participate in the parole hearing via videolink.”


	
	On 29 May 2014 Emma Albertini, Community Corrections Officer, prepared an “anniversary” report on Mr Potier to be considered by the Parole Authority. The report concluded:
	


“Mr Potier remains of interest to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection; they have indicated at this juncture if the offender is released to parole he would be held in immigration detention pending removal to his home country. Whilst Mr Potier has confirmed his intent to remain in Australia to continue with his outstanding legal proceedings, the Attorney Generals Department would be required to issue a criminal justice visa for this to occur.

However, given the lack of interventions available to the offender within the custodial environs and his anticipated removal from Australia, release to parole is recommended with the following conditions: 30 (victims) and 32.”


	
	On 8 July 2014 SORC prepared a report which concluded that it was appropriate for Mr Potier to be released to parole. Mr Potier was interviewed on 5 December 2014 and asked about his post-release accommodation. Mr Potier responded that it was “pointless” to address the question as he would be taken to immigration detention on his release. A supplementary report dated 14 January 2015 was prepared by SORC. A further report was prepared by SORC dated 17 February 2015 which concluded that it would be appropriate to release Mr Potier to parole.
	
	
	By letter dated 5 March 2015 Mr Potier asked the Parole Authority to defer consideration of parole “until the latter part of April 2015” due to pending matters before the Court of Criminal Appeal in which Mr Potier represented himself. On 12 March 2015 the Authority stood over the matter to 14 May 2015. On 8 May 2015 Ms Albertini interviewed Mr Potier. Her note recorded that she asked Mr Potier whether he “was intending on seeking his parole”, to which he is recorded as having responded “of course”. Consideration of his parole was further adjourned at his request. Correspondence ensued about the date for consideration of his parole, the details of which need not be set out.
	
	
	At its meeting on 13 August 2015 the Parole Authority formed an initial intention pursuant to s 144 of the Act to release Mr Potier to parole and advised him of its initial intention by letter dated 19 August 2015. Mr Potier was interviewed by Benjamin Neville, a Community Corrections Officer, on 20 August 2015. Mr Neville recorded the following in his case note:
	


“Throughout the interview, POTIER maintained that his Anniversary Date had passed and that it was an injustice that SPA [the Parole Authority] had not made a determination in relation to his release (as per legislation).”


	
	Ultimately there was a hearing before the Parole Authority on 2 October 2015. Mr Potier was represented by Will Hutchins, a senior solicitor at the Prisoners’ Legal Service. At the conclusion of the hearing on 2 October 2015 the Parole Authority issued a parole order in respect of Mr Potier and directed that he be released on parole no earlier than 16 October 2015 and no later than 23 October 2015. Later that day Mr Hutchins wrote to the Parole Authority taking issue with two conditions that had been imposed on the grant of parole. By letter dated 13 October 2015 the Parole Authority wrote to Mr Hutchins and confirmed that the conditions on the parole order would not be amended. The relevant conditions read as follows:
	


“15   The offender must not contact, communicate, watch, stalk, harass or intimidate Myra Linda Oswald, Glenn Stuart Wakeham and Sarah Oswald Potier.

16   The offender must submit to the supervision of Community Corrections in New South Wales, until such time as the offender has been removed/deported. If the offender is released from Immigration detention or returns to Australia before the expiry of his Parole Order, the offender must report to Community Corrections in New South Wales within seven days.”


	
	While he was in custody the plaintiff held a Bridging Visa: Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth), Sch 2 cl 050.211(7). Upon his release to parole, the visa expired: Sch 2 cl 050.515(c)(ii). Once his visa expired, the plaintiff became an unlawful non-citizen within the meaning of s 14 of the Migration Act. Upon his release to parole he was detained pursuant to s 189(1) of the Migration Act.
	
	
	There was no criminal stay warrant in force in respect of Mr Potier as his application for such a warrant was refused (Potier v NSW Parole Authority [2015] NSWSC 1775 at [75]-[76] per Hall J) and his application for leave to appeal was dismissed (Potier v NSW Parole Authority [2015] NSWCA 391). On 15 December 2015 officers of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection removed Mr Potier from Australia to the United Kingdom.
	


The parties’ submissions


	
	Mr Potier submitted that:
	



	
	He did not apply for parole;
	
	
	The Parole Authority had no power to release him to parole in the absence of an application;
	
	
	The requirement that there be an application by the offender is not a “procedural requirement” within the meaning of s 133 of the Act;
	
	
	His release to parole and his removal from Australia were, accordingly, invalid;
	
	
	He is entitled to be brought back to Australia and returned to custody to remain in a gaol in New South Wales unless and until either he applies for, and is released to, parole, or his sentence expires.
	



	
	The Commissioner submitted:
	



	
	The Parole Authority has power to release an offender to parole whether or not the offender applies for parole;
	
	
	In any event, Mr Potier effectively applied for parole and participated in the Parole Authority’s consideration whether to release him to parole such that he should be taken to have applied for parole;
	
	
	Even if the Parole Authority had no power to release Mr Potier to parole, he has been removed from Australia and none of the defendants is under any duty either to allow or require him to return. Although the Commonwealth Attorney-General (who is not a party to these proceedings) has a power to issue a criminal justice entry certificate under s 145 of the Migration Act, he has no duty to issue such a certificate and therefore cannot be compelled by Court order to do so. In these circumstances, this Court has no power to grant relief which would require his return to Australia.
	


Consideration

Whether the Parole Authority has power to grant parole when no application for parole is made

Consideration of the text


	
	The Act requires the Parole Authority to consider whether a serious offender should be released on parole at least 60 days before the eligibility date (s  143). This obligation arises whether or not the offender has applied for parole.
	
	
	The offender has a right to apply for parole under s 143A at any time within 90 days before the annual review date. If an application is made under s 143A, the Parole Authority must consider whether to release the offender to parole. The term “application” is not defined in the Act. The Act does not specify any formal requirements for an application for parole. There is no requirement, for example, for such an application to be in writing (cf. s 19).
	
	
	The Act does not expressly confer a power on the Parole Authority to release an offender to parole in circumstances where the eligibility date has expired and the offender has not applied for parole. However, the provisions referred to above which impose a duty on the Parole Authority to consider release to parole ought not, in my view, be read as constraints on its power to consider, and to order, release to parole.
	
	
	As set out above, s 126(2) provides that an offender is eligible for release on parole if he or she has served the non-parole period of the sentence passed. In my view, s 126(2), when read in the context of the Act as a whole and in particular Part 6, ought be read as providing not only for the circumstances in which an offender is eligible for release on parole but also as conferring a power on the relevant authority, the Parole Authority, to release an eligible offender to parole.
	
	
	This interpretation is consistent with the wording of s 138(1AA) which provides for the period to be specified in a parole order made under s 138(1) and with the wording of s 151(1) which provides for the period to be specified in a parole order made under s 149 or s 150. Subparagraphs (a), (a1) and (b) of s 138(1AA) (for offenders other than serious offenders) and of s 151(1) (for serious offenders) are, in my view, intended to cover all cases. Subparagraph (a) provides for a grant of parole on and from the offender’s parole eligibility date; subparagraph (a1) provides for a grant of parole made “following an application by an offender”; and subparagraph (b) covers “any other case”. The reference to “any other case” in s 138(1AA)(b) and s 151(1)(b) provides a strong textual indication that Parliament intended that the Parole Authority had power (both to serious offenders and offenders other than serious offenders) to grant parole other than by reference to the parole eligibility date or as a result of an application by an offender.
	


The legislative purpose of Part 6


	
	This construction is consistent with the purpose of the statutory provisions (and is therefore to be preferred: s 33 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW)). It is, in my view, of importance that the Act does not include the wishes of the offender in the list of matters which the Parole Authority is obliged to take into account in deciding whether to release an offender to parole. The reason for this is that the question whether an offender is released to parole depends on whether it is “appropriate in the public interest” that the offender be released and not on whether the offender wants to be released. It may well advance the object in s 2A(1)(d) of the Act for an offender to be released to parole even in the absence of an application. Such a grant of parole might aid the reintegration of an offender since, if an offender is not released until the expiry of the term of imprisonment, he or she does not have the benefit of such supervision as is provided to offenders on parole.
	


The effect of s 48 of the Interpretation Act


	
	Section 48(1) of the Interpretation Act also bears on the question. It relevantly provides that if an Act confers a function on a body (the Parole Authority), the function may be exercised from time to time as occasion requires. When s 135 (which confers functions on the Parole Authority) is read with s 126, it produces the result that the Parole Authority has power to release an offender to parole at any time after the non-parole part of the total term has been served and the Parole Authority is satisfied that it is appropriate in the public interest to do so. The Parole Authority’s duty to consider whether to release an offender to parole at certain times (at least 60 days before the time the offender first becomes eligible for release on parole: s 137(1) and on the offender’s application: s 137A) is not inconsistent with the existence of a general power to release an offender to parole at other times, or, indeed, at any time.
	


The legislative history of s 143A


	
	The legislative history of s 143A is also instructive. Before s 143A was inserted (by the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Amendment (Parole) Act 2004 (NSW), s 143(1) of the Act provided:
	


143 Preliminary consideration by Parole Board

(1) The Parole Board must give preliminary consideration as to whether or not a serious offender should be released on parole:

(a) at least 60 days before the day on which the offender becomes eligible for release on parole, and

(b) if the offender is not released on parole on or after that day, within each successive year following that day (unless the offender is no longer eligible for release on parole), and

(c) if the offender is released on parole on or after that day but the parole order is revoked and a further parole order is not subsequently made, within each successive year following that revocation (unless the offender is no longer eligible for release on parole).


	
	It can be seen that s 143 did not provide that an application for parole would trigger the obligation of the Parole Board (being the statutory predecessor to the Parole Authority) to consider whether an offender should be released on parole. Rather, the obligation arose on certain days or within certain periods, irrespective of an application. The “evil” which the insertion of s 143A was designed to address and the means whereby the purpose was to be achieved appear from the following extract from the Second Reading Speech (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 27 October 2004, p 12098ff):
	


“The Government is proposing to make changes to the procedures in respect of the consideration of an offender for parole. These changes, apart from being in the interests of general efficiency, are in the community interest and in the interests of the victims of crime. Sections 137 and 143 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 provide that, if an offender is not released on parole when the offender first becomes eligible for release, the Parole Board must reconsider the matter within each successive year unless the offender is no longer eligible for release on parole. Generally speaking, the Parole Board should reconsider each case towards the end of each subsequent 12-month period. The Parole Board is able to decline to reconsider a case for up to three years and can defer making a decision for up to two months.

In the past, the Parole Board has sometimes reconsidered cases early in the ensuing 12-month period after an offender has not been released on parole. In the Government's view, the early reconsideration of a case is contrary to the original intention of Parliament. Moreover, the practice consumes the resources of the board, the Department of Corrective Services, and the Serious Offenders Review Council when a serious offender is involved. The early consideration of cases may cause anguish to some victims. The making of a submission would be a difficult exercise for many victims.Proposed new sections 137A and 143A will ensure that the SPA [the Parole Authority] is to reconsider cases only at the end of each subsequent 12-month period. . . .

As I stated earlier, where an offender is not released on parole when he or she first becomes eligible for parole, sections 137 and 143 require the Parole Board to reconsider the offender within each successive year. The offender does not need to apply to be reconsidered—it happens automatically. However, some offenders behave so poorly that they know, or should know, that they have no prospect of gaining parole. The Government believes that it is reasonable for the Act to be amended to provide that where the SPA has refused to make a parole order at the end of a non-parole period, or where a parole order has been revoked and the offender returned to custody, the SPA should not be automatically required to reconsider the offender for parole each year.

The SPA should be required to reconsider an offender's case only if the offender applies for parole. The manifest injustice safeguard exists to protect the legitimate interests of offenders. By requiring offenders to apply for parole, the Government will reduce the number of cases to be considered by the SPA where all parties to the proceedings know that, given the circumstances, the offender will not be granted parole. The Government also believes that an offender should not be entitled automatically to a review hearing after the SPA has formed an initial intention not to release the offender on parole.”


	
	The extrinsic materials show that s 143A, which makes provision for consideration following an application, was inserted to protect the resources of the Board and to save the victims and their families the anguish of the prospect of release to parole, except at particular times. Its purpose was not to disempower the Parole Authority from releasing an offender to parole in circumstances where no application had been made.
	


Conclusion: an application is not a precondition for the release of an offender to parole


	
	The question whether an offender ought be released to parole is one for the Parole Authority. An offender may wish to remain in custody when it would be appropriate in the public interest that he or she be released but it is not for an offender to dictate the term of his or her custody beyond the expiry of a non-parole period. A sentence of imprisonment does not confer a right on an offender to be kept in custody until the expiry of the total term. Although the Act might have been worded more clearly, it is, in my view, plain that the Authority’s power to release an offender to parole cannot be controlled by the offender’s wish, either for parole or for continued incarceration.
	
	
	Accordingly, even if Mr Potier ought not be taken to have applied for parole, the Parole Authority had power to release him to parole since he had served the non-parole period of his sentence and the Parole Authority was satisfied that it was appropriate to release him to parole.
	
	
	In these circumstances it is not necessary to consider whether the parole order, even if it did not comply with the Act, is invalid or whether, as a matter of fact, Mr Potier actually applied for parole. However, in deference to the parties’ submissions I shall address the latter question.
	


Whether Mr Potier applied for parole


	
	It appears that the Parole Authority began considering whether to release Mr Potier to parole on the annual review date, although it had not received a written application from him. The evidence does not disclose any application, whether formal or informal, for release to parole. Nonetheless, as the chronology set out above indicates, Mr Potier did not demur from the proposition that he ought be treated as having applied for release to parole. Indeed, he complained at times that the consideration of his release to parole was not as fast as it ought to have been. He participated in interviews, the sole purpose of which was to determine whether release to parole was appropriate. Furthermore, his legal representative, Mr Hutchins, did not at any stage of the hearing on 2 October 2015 inform the Parole Authority that Mr Potier opposed parole.
	
	
	The assumption (which would appear to underpin the Act) that an offender wants to be released does not appear to apply to Mr Potier who would prefer incarceration in New South Wales to liberty in the United Kingdom. However, he did not disabuse the Parole Authority of the correctness of such an assumption until after the parole order had been made and its consequences became apparent. Indeed he actively participated in the Authority’s assessment of whether it was appropriate that he be released. In my view, the evidence establishes that at least by the time of the hearing on 2 October 2015, Mr Potier had applied for parole.
	


Whether relief ought be granted


	
	The question whether relief ought be granted does not arise as Mr Potier has not established that the parole order did not comply with the Act. It is sufficient to note that a grant of relief under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) in the nature of mandamus (as sought in the present case) depends on a defendant being under a relevant duty. There is no relevant duty to return Mr Potier to Australia. Although the Commonwealth Attorney-General has power to issue a criminal justice entry certificate under s 145 of the Migration Act, he has no duty to do so: see Animals’ Angels e.V. v Secretary, Department of Agriculture [2014] FCAFC 173; 228 FCR 35 at [48]-[62] per Kenny and Robertson JJ. Further, although the Commonwealth Attorney-General may seek Mr Potier’s return under s 40 of the Extradition Act, he has no duty to do so, it being a matter peculiarly within his discretion.
	
	
	Accordingly, even if (contrary to my findings) the parole order did not comply with the Act and was invalid (a question unnecessary to decide), Mr Potier would not be entitled to any relief beyond a declaration, the utility of which has not been established.
	


Orders


	
	For the foregoing reasons I make the following orders:
	



	
	Dismiss the summons.
	
	
	Order the plaintiff to pay the defendants’ costs of the proceedings.

2768728,Henderson v R [2016] NSWCCA 8,"Judgment


	
	CHIEF JUSTICE BATHURST: I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL and with his Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:

	The application is brought under s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The applicant relies upon the following grounds:
	


Ground 1: Her Honour erred in her application of the sentencing principles of the time in a number of material respects. 

Ground 2: Her Honour failed to take into account the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty.

Ground 3: Her Honour erred in finding that the applicant was in a position of trust in respect of all offending or alternatively, offending on sequences 1 – 7 inclusive.

Ground 4: Her Honour erred in failing to take into account or alternatively, gave insufficient weight to the applicant’s lack of offending since 1975 in making findings as to rehabilitation and the risk of re-offending.

Ground 5: Her Honour erred in finding without evidence that the applicant was not unlikely to re-offend.

Ground 6: The sentence was manifestly excessive.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	The proceedings before her Honour proceeded on the basis of agreed facts. The relevant facts are as follows. The applicant was born in 1940. He was the uncle of LB and RB and a cousin of CC. CC is deaf and had been since she was aged two and a half. The victim GM was not related and did not know the other three complainants.
	
	
	CC was born in 1958 and was aged three at the time of the offences. The applicant was aged 21. CC would regularly visit the applicant and his mother at their home on Friday nights after dinner. When they arrived, the adults would sit in the lounge-room to chat and drink tea. The applicant was always present and CC recalled that he used to perform magic tricks, such as making coins disappear.
	
	
	During one evening, the applicant and CC were alone in the laundry together and the applicant shut the door. He picked CC up and held her in front of him with her legs wrapped around his waist. CC was wearing a dress at the time. The applicant started touching CC’s vagina and pressing against it with his fingers. CC described his actions as being “like a bumping” sensation (offence 1, Form 1). The applicant then removed his penis from his pants and rubbed it against CC’s vagina (count 1). CC was wearing her underpants at the time.
	
	
	As he was doing this, the applicant continued to breathe heavily for a couple of minutes until he ejaculated. Following this, the applicant’s mother suddenly opened the door and he immediately bent down and pretended he was patting the dogs. The applicant’s mother left the laundry and he and CC went back inside the house.
	
	
	On another later occasion the applicant was at home when CC and her parents visited. During the afternoon, he took CC to the laundry room and shut the door. He picked CC up in exactly the same manner as previously and placed her legs around his waist. He then pulled CC’s underpants to one side and rubbed her vagina with his hand (offence 2, Form 1). He then unbuckled his belt, removed his penis from his pants and rubbed it against CC’s vagina (count 2).
	
	
	The applicant then placed CC’s hand on his penis for a couple of minutes (count 3). He continued touching CC for a few minutes but stopped when his mother walked into the laundry. The applicant again pretended to be patting the dogs. The applicant and CC then left the laundry and played outside in the backyard with the dogs.
	
	
	RB and LB, who were the applicant’s nephew and niece respectively, spent most weekends at their grandparents’ house where the applicant was usually present.
	
	
	One evening in about 1974 LB with her brother and parents visited the applicant and his parents at Campsie. They had dinner together and after dinner, LB and RB went to the applicant’s bedroom to watch television while the adults stayed in the back room playing cards. LB was aged between seven and eight. The applicant was aged 33 – 34.
	
	
	The applicant gave LB a musk lolly stick and she recalled falling asleep soon after. She awoke later but was unable to open her eyes. The applicant asked her if she was okay but she recalled being unable to speak. The applicant pulled her pants down and lifted up her top. He then removed his penis from his pants and rubbed it against her vagina. LB could feel the head of his penis on her vagina and later felt what she described as a warm liquid in the area (count 4). The applicant then wiped the complainant’s vagina clean with a handkerchief.
	
	
	On another occasion, LB had again fallen asleep in the offender’s bedroom and woke up without any clothes on. She could feel his fingers inside her vagina and heard him say “I’m just trying to change you into your pyjamas”. LB again recalled feeling wet between her legs (count 5). The applicant wiped the complainant’s body with a face-washer and put her clothes back on. LB left the bedroom to watch TV in the lounge-room.
	
	
	Their grandfather died in 1977. Due to the house being so small when LB and RB stayed over, RB and the offender would share the same bed and sleep head to toe. On one occasion, RB was in the offender’s bed, lying head to toe. He was lying on his back and the applicant moved his hand up his leg and under his boxer shorts towards his groin. The applicant then grabbed RB’s penis and fondled it (count 6). RB was aged between eight and nine at the time.
	
	
	On another occasion, RB was again in the applicant’s bed sleeping head to toe, when the applicant moved his hand upwards and began to rub his penis over his underpants (count 7). At the same time, the applicant made RB rub his (the applicant’s) leg.
	
	
	GB was a member of St Michael’s parish and regularly attended St Michael’s Church with her parents. During the 1960’s St Michaels Church and School held an annual fete. On one occasion between November 1964 and November 1967 a popular children’s entertainer was hired to perform at the fete. The applicant was a hobby magician and this year he was tasked to assist the professional performer.
	
	
	One afternoon the applicant approached GB who recognised him from the church and knew that he was a magician. He asked GB to assist him in carrying things for the show that night and offered two shillings as payment. GB agreed to help and walked with the applicant to his house.
	
	
	Inside the house the applicant took GB to the sunroom. He then stood facing her and lifted her school uniform and placed his hand down her underpants, probing her genital area. He inserted his fingers into her vagina for a few seconds with a motion GB described as “digging deep” (count 8). The applicant continued to touch and stroke GB’s genital area with his fingers for a couple of minutes in total (count 9). The applicant had his other arm around the victim at the time.
	
	
	The applicant and GB then moved to the sunbed and lay down together – the victim was lying beside and slightly on top of the applicant. GB recalled feeling terrified and begging the applicant to take her back to the fete. GB ran from the house and returned to the fete. GB was aged between seven and ten at the time and the applicant was aged between 24 and 27.
	
	
	LB’s daughter’s christening was held in October 1994 when LB was aged 28. At the christening the applicant picked up LB’s daughter which triggered a memory flashback for her. The following day LB told her parents that she remembered the applicant doing things to her that he should not have done. LB’s father confronted the applicant by telephone later that same day.
	
	
	LB and her father discussed speaking to the police but LB had concerns about her own daughter’s safety. There was no contact between LB and her parents with the applicant until 2013. In February 2013 RB drove to the applicant’s home in Parramatta and confronted him about the incidents involving him. The applicant admitted to RB that he had touched and fondled him.
	
	
	CC first spoke about the assault to her own daughter in 2008. At a family barbeque in March 2013 CC became aware of the allegations in relation to RB and it was at this point that she spoke of her own abuse. GB provided her statement to the police in July 2013.
	
	
	On 15 August 2013 the applicant was arrested and charged. He participated in a recorded interview with police on the same date, and during this interview he did not deny the allegations in relation to GB. Additionally, the applicant told police that members of his family had spoken to him about allegations concerning LB and he stated that he had touched her at least half a dozen times. On 7 November 2013 the applicant was interviewed by police and he did not deny the allegations in relation to RB.
	
	
	It was common ground that until the commission of the first offence in 1961, the applicant was of good character and had no relevant convictions. In 1968, however, (during the course of the offending for which he was in due course sentenced), the applicant was charged and pleaded guilty to an offence of indecent assault involving the unlawful detention of a 10 year old girl. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 18 months. His family was unaware of this offending, conviction and imprisonment.
	


Remarks on sentence


	
	Her Honour noted that the applicant had pleaded guilty at an early point in time. Her Honour noted:
	


“The court is required to consider in so far as possible, sentencing practices as at the date of the offences, while considering the specific actions that occurred and the objective seriousness of those acts within the charged offence. A formal discount of 25% was not usually a sentence consideration stated to be taken into account in sentencing at the time of the commission of these offences. Both considerations apply when considering a sentence at this time. Usually a non parole period to parole period ratio was between 50% - 70%.” (ROS 2.9 – 3.2)


	
	Her Honour took into account R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368 and MPB v R [2013] NSWCCA 213; 234 A Crim R 576 as providing guidance for sentencing in circumstances where in the case of old offending, sentencing practices had changed and sentences had increased. Her Honour noted that although she had been provided with sentencing statistics relating to offences which had taken place in the 1960’s and 1970’s, these were of only limited value because they said nothing about the objective and subjective circumstances of each case. Nevertheless, her Honour accepted as a matter of principle that when sentencing for these matters she needed to follow sentencing practices which were current at the time when the offences occurred.
	
	
	When considering the objective seriousness of the offending, her Honour noted that there were four complainants and that the offending had taken place over 17 years. Her Honour had regard to the fact that the victims were young children. Her Honour considered that even though each case had to be dealt with on its own facts, and on its own particular circumstances, issues such as the number of victims, the duration of the offences and the extent of the sexual invasion were all relevant. Because there were a number of features of the offending common to all or most of the offences, her Honour dealt with questions such as the objective seriousness of the offending in a global way.
	
	
	By reference to the victim impact statements, her Honour found that the offending had caused considerable emotional harm to the victims. It was clear from those statements that each of the victims had suffered anguish and terror at the time of the offending. Her Honour noted that some of the victims continued to experience psychological difficulties up to the present time.
	
	
	Her Honour found that while some of the offences were not planned but were opportunistic, there were elements of premeditation in that the applicant took the victims to rooms in the house which were out of the way and in the case of GB, used a pretext to persuade her to enter his home.
	
	
	Her Honour took into account the age of the victims at the time of the offending. For the offence against s 81, there was no gradation of age so that the lower the age, the more serious the criminality. In the case of the offences under s 76, the upper age limit was 16 and in this case the age of the children ranged between 3 years and 8 years. Her Honour regarded that as also representing a significant aggravating feature.
	
	
	In the case of the victims CC, LB and RB her Honour found that the familial relationship gave rise to a breach of trust. Her Honour said:
	


“19   It is an obvious aggravating feature if the offender was in a position of trust and violated that trust by sexually assaulting the child. The position is worse when the offender is a family member such as the offender. When the children attended at the home occupied by himself and his parents, extended family had the right to expect that their children would be in a safe place and trust was extended on that basis.

20   For the very young complainant CC (sequences 1- 3 ), she was taken to the home by her own mother who obviously trusted the offender.

21    The other children LB and RB were taken to the home by their parents and visited nearly every weekend as it was the home of the grandparents. The breach of trust in that family situation is a serious one. The nature of the trust, and the closeness of the family relationship meant that these children had no one to complain to, thus making them more helpless and the offending as a whole generally more serious.

22   It was submitted that there are worse examples of a breach of trust, and that is true, but this observation is of little assistance as the court is required to look at the entire circumstances of the offending.” (ROS 5.9 – 6.5)


	
	When sentencing the applicant for the offences against those victims, her Honour found “breach of trust” as a particular aggravating feature.
	
	
	The physical acts of the offending covered a wide spectrum. Her Honour observed that the penetration of female genitalia was always regarded as a serious form of indecent assault which was further aggravated when ejaculation occurred. This was because of the confronting nature of ejaculation to a young child. Her Honour regarded skin to skin contact with the applicant’s penis as significantly more serious than that which involved touching on the outside of clothing.
	
	
	While her Honour was prepared to accept that until the occurrence of the first offence the applicant was a person of good character, that benefit was lost thereafter. This was particularly so after the 1968 conviction.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. Her Honour was prepared to accept that he did feel genuine remorse and noted his evidence that he was now a different person to the person who had offended against the complainants when they were children. This acceptance was qualified by her Honour’s observation that:
	


“31   … Until he undergoes proper counselling and a full forensic risk assessment, the only observation I can make is that he appears to be ready to accept his responsibility and he is prepared to accept the consequences of his past behaviour. His plea of guilt is an acceptance of responsibility.” (ROS 8.9 – 9.1)


	
	In relation to prospects of rehabilitation and risks of re-offending, her Honour rejected the assessment in the psychologist’s report of Ms Howell which was tendered on behalf of the applicant. The basis of her rejection was that the conclusions in the report depended upon the accuracy of the history which she had received. By reference to other material, her Honour was not satisfied that the facts on which the psychologist’s opinion depended were correct.
	
	
	While her Honour noted that the applicant had not committed any further offences of this kind for approximately 40 years, and that during this time there had been opportunities for him to do so, she gave that factor only limited weight. Her Honour expressed her conclusion as follows:
	


“36   … His insight into the causes of his offending and the consequences are limited. This is not unusual for an offender in his position. He has never been confronted with his conduct in a therapeutic setting. That is not his fault. His lack of insight would not enable him to acknowledge the necessity of it.

37   I note and observe that in 1968 he also told a psychiatric consultant that he did not regard himself as abnormal or in need of psychiatric treatment but thereafter proceeded to offend on numerous occasions. Until Mr Henderson is challenged with respect to his past behaviour this court could not make a finding that he is rehabilitated and at a very low risk of re offending.

38   My observation is that Mr Henderson’s risk of re-offending is certainly reduced by his family and social support and by his advanced age however the fact that he has never really acknowledged the distorted nature of his sexual offending against children and confronted that and perhaps undergone some of the appropriate counselling that is offered to people who do sexually offend against children then his risk of reoffending must to some extent be an unknown quantity.” (ROS 11.2 - .7)


	
	Before setting out her aggregate sentence and the indicative sentences, her Honour noted that she had to take into account the totality of the offending and the context of the individual charges. She noted that she was required to strike a balance between ensuring that the criminality of each offence was reflected in the sentence imposed and that the principle of totality was also observed. Because there were multiple victims, there had to be a proper level of accumulation.
	


Ground 1: Her Honour erred in her application of the sentencing principles of the time in a number of material respects. 


	
	Before embarking on a consideration of the grounds of appeal, it needs to be remembered that there is no appeal from “indicative sentences” that are indicated in the course of imposing an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The application for leave to appeal must be in respect of a sentence, which is a sentence actually imposed, being the aggregate sentence not an indicative sentence which by definition has not been imposed.
	
	
	However, as Nykolyn v R [2012] NSWCCA 219 made clear, in some cases the indicative sentences can make clear that error has occurred in the reasoning process leading towards the imposition of the aggregate sentence. Where that occurs, the appropriateness of the aggregate sentence imposed arises for consideration. This is one of those cases.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that her Honour was provided with, but did not refer to, a document entitled “Sentences Imposed for Indecent Assaults Committed in the 1960s and 70s” which did include information about the objective offending and subjective circumstances of offenders. He submitted that that document, together with the statistical information, provided a discernible sentencing pattern as required by Dousha v R [2008] NSWCCA 263 and R v MJR.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that her Honour failed to have regard to the sentencing practice at the time regarding the relationship between the head sentence and the non-parole period. The applicant submitted that her Honour’s finding that the ratio between a non-parole period and the parole period at the time of between 50% and 70% was in error. He submitted that the correct ratio was between 35% and 50% of the head sentence.
	


Consideration


	
	The applicant’s submission should be accepted. Two relatively recent decisions have considered this issue in considerable detail. Those decisions are Magnuson v R [2013] NSWCCA 50 and MPB v R to which her Honour was specifically referred. In Magnuson Button J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreed) accepted the following propositions:
	


“84   It is true that, for over a decade, it has been clear that a sentencing judge dealing with very old offences must take into account the sentencing patterns that existed at the time of the offences: see R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368.

85   If such a pattern is unable to be discerned, the judge should commence the sentencing process in the usual way; that is, by reference to the maximum penalty, and the place in the range of objective gravity occupied by the offence: see Moon v R [2000] NSWCCA 534; 117 A Crim R 497 at [66] - [71] per Howie J (with whom Fitzgerald JA agreed).

86   Even if a sentencing judge does take an established sentencing pattern into account, a failure adequately to reflect the principle and the relevant sentencing pattern may cause the sentence to be manifestly excessive, or otherwise erroneous: see RWB v R [2008] NSWCCA 93; 184 A Crim R 453 at [24] - [26].

87   If sentencing for offences committed at a time when the statutory ratio did not exist, sentencing judges should sentence in accordance with that fact: see AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51; 169 A Crim R 32 at [36] - [37] and Rosenstrauss v R [2012] NSWCCA 25 at [16].

88   Having said that, a court sentencing today with regard to old offences with regard to which a different sentencing pattern can be discerned must nevertheless bear in mind that, since 1974, it has been established that a non-parole period represents the minimum period of imprisonment required to be served by an offender having regard to all of the purposes of justice: Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623, referred to in AJB v R and many subsequent cases dealing with the principle under discussion.

89   Finally, in appeals to this Court, reduction has not been automatic, even if it is determined that the sentencing judge failed to advert to the principle: see, for example, Mottram v R [2009] NSWCCA 210 and RLS v R [2012] NSWCCA 236.

90   Applying those principles to this case, I consider that a sentencing pattern with regard to sexual offences committed against children in the late 1970s and early 1980s can be established. That is founded upon five factors. The first is the statistics that were before her Honour and this Court relating to disposition of offences in 1976 and 1978. The second is summaries of cases. Some were provided by the parties to her Honour. Others are contained in other decisions of this Court dealing with this question. The third is the general increase in sentences that has occurred across the board in New South Wales over the past quarter century. The fourth is the upward movement in maximum penalties with regard to the crimes of the applicant between the period under consideration and today. The fifth is judicial memory. I shall deal with each of those factors in turn.”


	
	In MPB v R  Garling J with whom R A Hulme J agreed said:
	


“87   The guide which is entirely objective and is easily ascertainable and therefore which is likely to be of most use to a sentencing court when attempting to impose sentences which accord with an earlier practice or pattern, is the maximum penalty fixed by the law for the offence charged, together with the range of criminality encompassed by the offence charged. By having regard to these features a sentencing judge will be able to readily assess where the particular offence charged falls along the spectrum of conduct encapsulated in the offence and accordingly how the particular offence ought be viewed against the maximum penalty fixed by the legislation.

…

93   This Court has held that when sentences were imposed when the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 was in operation (as it was at the time of the offences in counts 1 to 4), the non-parole periods imposed were usually in the order of one-third to one-half of the head sentence: See: AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51 at [36]; GRD v R [2009] NSWCCA 149 at [20]; and BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303 at [154 ]- [156]. This is factor that a sentencing judge should take into account in considering whether there are special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

…

96   Counts 1 to 4 on the indictment charged offences under s 76 of the Crimes Act 1900, which as it then stood, was the offence of indecent assault against a child under the age of 16 years. It was repealed in 1981. At the time of the offences in Counts 1 and 2, the maximum penalty was 5 years. At the time of the offences in Counts 3 and 4, the maximum penalty had been increased to 6 years.

97   The offence of indecent assault, contrary to s 76, included within it many offences which today fall to be categorised as sexual assault under current legislation. Prohibited conduct, involving penetration and including fellatio and cunnilingus, were included within the offence under s 76. There was then a much broader range of conduct susceptible to charges under this section: see BP at [158] per Fullerton J; Nelson v R [2007] NSWCCA 221 at [17] per Latham J.

…

106   I am prepared to accept, as did the sentencing judge, that the offences were serious because of the extent of the breach of trust involved, but what was required of the sentencing judge was that he should have made an assessment of where the offences fell on the spectrum of conduct encompassed by an offence against s 76 of the Crimes Act. This he failed to do. Having regard to that range, I am not satisfied that these offences fell above the mid-point of the range. On the contrary, the criminality fell well below that mid-point and could not justify the sentences which was imposed for Counts 1 and 2.”


	
	Applying those principles and without detailed reference to each of the indicative sentences, it is quite apparent that the head sentence in most cases was considerably above that which would be appropriate if the approach recommended in Magnuson v R and by Garling J in MPB v R were followed. The fact that that error is clearly apparent in relation to the indicative sentences must place in question the aggregate sentence actually imposed.
	


Ground 2: Her Honour failed to take into account the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty.


	
	The applicant submitted that her Honour’s approach to applying the discount for the early plea of guilty was wrong. He submitted that while an offender ought not be sentenced more harshly than would have occurred had the sentencing been in accordance with sentencing practice at the time of the offending, courts do not apply the procedural rules then in effect. He submitted that a court should apply the procedural rules in effect at the time when sentence was imposed, i.e. the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He submitted that compliance with that requirement would require that a 25% discount be applied.
	


Consideration


	
	Because the sentence under consideration is an aggregate sentence, there is no requirement that the 25% discount for an early plea of guilty be applied to the aggregate sentence. It represents the sentence which has been imposed after taking into account the considerations leading to the formulation of the indicative sentences. Accordingly, the 25% discount is to be applied to the indicative sentences.
	
	
	When that is done to the indicative sentences in this case, it is readily apparent that in some cases the head sentence exceeded the maximum penalty available or was otherwise very close to the maximum sentence. It follows that there is a strong inference that her Honour erroneously thought that applying sentencing practices which were in place at the time of the offending meant that she should not apply a 25% discount for an early plea of guilty. It follows that none of the indicative sentences had that discount built into them. This was an error and provides another reason why it will in due course be necessary to reconsider the aggregate sentence.
	


Ground 3: Her Honour erred in finding that the applicant was in a position of trust in respect of all offending or alternatively, offending on sequences 1 – 7 inclusive.


	
	The applicant submitted that for the purposes of s 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 it could not be said that he had “abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim”. He submitted that although her Honour had not in terms referred to s 21A(2)(k), her Honour’s assertion that he was “in a position of trust” and her Honour’s finding that his conduct involved a serious breach of trust, must mean that her Honour had the section in mind.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the fact that his niece, nephew and second cousin may have trusted him as a family member, or that their parents trusted him, so as to enable him to be physically close to them in private did not provide a basis for a finding of a position of trust in the sense envisaged by the section. The applicant relied upon the observation of Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ and Hislop J agreed) in Karl Suleman v R [2009] NSWCCA 70 at [22]:
	


“22   This aggravating factor is not made out simply because the victim trusted the offender for some reason or other. … The relevant factor is that there was at the time of the offending a particular relationship between the offender and the victim that amounted to “a position of trust”. It is a special relationship existing between them and transcends the usual duty of care arising between persons in the community in their everyday contact or their business and social dealings. …”

That statement of principle was recently approved in Peiris v R [2014] NSWCCA 58 (Leeming JA, Button J and RS Hulme AJ).


	
	The applicant submitted that by reference to the agreed facts, at no time was he left in charge of his niece, nephew and second cousin. The parents or grandparents were always present in the house and he undertook no duty of supervision. Rather, the children were left to play and sleep in the house where he resided at a time when the parents or grandparents were also in the house. He submitted that there was no special relationship as contemplated by the authorities on this section.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the qualified concession by his counsel in the sentencing proceedings (T.31.49, T.32.1 - .7 and T.33.29 - .34) did not amount to a concession that s 21A(2)(k) applied. It went no further than a concession that as an older person and as a member of the family there was “some breach of trust” in his dealings with his niece, nephew and second cousin.
	


Consideration


	
	This ground of appeal has been made out. There was no proper basis for her Honour finding a breach of trust as provided for by s 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 if that is in fact what her Honour did. This was not the sort of relationship envisaged by the section and by the authorities which have applied it. Even giving the section an extended meaning, such as where the person in authority was a babysitter or a taxi driver, there was no abuse of a position of trust or authority in the circumstances of this case. What occurred was that the applicant took advantage of the familial relationship and his age to gain access to his victims.
	
	
	If her Honour did not intend to have regard to s 21A(2)(k) then the circumstance of aggravation to which she referred goes no further than a restatement of the essential factual background, i.e. a person in his late twenties and early thirties taking sexual advantage of young children.
	


Ground 4: Her Honour erred in failing to take into account or alternatively, gave insufficient weight to the applicant’s lack of offending since 1975 in making findings as to rehabilitation and the risk of re-offending.

Ground 5: Her Honour erred in finding without evidence that the applicant was not unlikely to re-offend.


	
	The applicant accepted that it was open to her Honour to reject the opinion of the psychologist, Ms Howell, which was favourable to him on this issue, on the basis that her opinion was based on an incorrect statement of the facts. The applicant nevertheless submitted that that was not the end of the matter. He submitted that her Honour’s finding involved a rejection of the reasons given by him for his offending approximately 40 years before, but did not address the issue of whether he was likely to re-offend in the future. The applicant submitted that on that issue her Honour had failed to make proper allowance for the fact that he had not offended for approximately 40 years despite having had the opportunity to do so with other young children with whom he had come in contact.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that there was no evidence before her Honour as to there being an increased risk of him re-offending after such a long period of time because he had not really acknowledged the distorted nature of his offending. The applicant submitted that there was no evidence before her Honour as to there being an increased risk of him re-offending after such a long period of time because he had not undertaken “appropriate counselling”.
	


Consideration


	
	This ground of appeal has been made out. There was no evidence before her Honour to justify her Honour’s conclusions as set out at [40] hereof. These are not the sort of matters of which a court can take judicial notice. They will differ from case to case and will depend on expert opinion applied to the particular facts of the case.
	
	
	In this matter the applicant’s actions over the last 40 years are of considerable probative value on this issue. He is now aged 75 and has not re-offended, despite the opportunity to do so, for approximately 40 years. Since the applicant will have to be re-sentenced, it is open to this Court to have regard to his affidavit of 24 September 2015. That affidavit is indicative of considerable remorse. It is not without significance that the applicant is supported by and regularly visited by his children and step-daughter. He has applied to be assessed for a sex offenders course and has indicated a willingness to do any course that is recommended to him. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation and not re-offending, are good.
	


Ground 6: The sentence was manifestly excessive.


	
	Given the findings in relation to the other grounds of appeal, it is not necessary to further consider this ground.
	


Conclusion


	
	The errors to which reference has been made, while primarily focused on the indicative sentences rather than the aggregate sentence, must give rise to considerable doubts about the appropriateness of those indicative sentences. Because of those doubts, the aggregate sentence which was based upon the indicative sentences, must be regarded as problematic.
	
	
	As was said by the plurality (French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ) in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601:
	


“42   … When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration , the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ""warranted in law"". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. …”


	
	In the circumstances of this case I am satisfied that error has occurred and that the applicant will have to be re-sentenced. Pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1912, leave is required and should be granted. I propose the following indicative sentences:
	


Count 1 (attaching the two Form 1 offences) – Imprisonment for 18 months.

Count 2 – Imprisonment for 2 years.

Count 3 – Imprisonment for 18 months.

Count 4 – Imprisonment for 2 years.

Count 5 – Imprisonment for 2 years.

Count 6 – Imprisonment for 18 months.

Count 7 – Imprisonment for 12 months.

Count 8 – Imprisonment for 18 months.

Count 9 – Imprisonment for 2 years.


	
	The fact of some degree of accumulation and that the sentence to be imposed reflects an earlier sentencing regime, constitute special circumstances.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Allow the appeal
	
	
	Quash the sentences imposed by Judge Syme on 13 November 2014.
	
	
	Sentence the Applicant to an aggregate sentence including a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 16 October 2014 together with a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 16 October 2017.
	
	
	Record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that the Applicant should be released to parole 16 October 2017.
	
	
	Imprisonment for 5 years commencing 16 October 2014 and expiring on 15 October 2019 with a non-parole period of 3 years expiring 15 October 2017.
	



	
	RS HULME AJ: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the Reasons for Judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL. I agree with his Honour that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal allowed, the sentence imposed by Judge Syme quashed and a sentence of imprisonment for 5 years imposed. I agree also with his Honour’s Reasons for coming to those conclusions.
	
	
	However I am unable to agree with the indicative sentences referred to by his Honour or with the non-parole period of the sentence which his Honour proposes should be imposed by this Court.
	
	
	In that connection, I will take the liberty of repeating what was said in MPB v R [2013] NSWCCA 213; 234 A Crim R 576 at [97] and [106]:
	


The offence of indecent assault, contrary to s 76, included within it many offences which today fall to be categorised as sexual assault under current legislation. Prohibited conduct, involving penetration and including fellatio and cunnilingus, were included within the offence under s 76. There was then a much broader range of conduct susceptible to charges under this section: see BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 303 at [158] per Fullerton J; Nelson v R [2007] NSWCCA 221 at [17] per Latham J.

I am prepared to accept, as did the sentencing judge, that the offences were serious because of the extent of the breach of trust involved, but what was required of the sentencing judge was that he should have made an assessment of where the offences fell on the spectrum of conduct encompassed by an offence against s 76 of the Crimes Act. This he failed to do. Having regard to that range, I am not satisfied that these offences fell above the mid-point of the range. On the contrary, the criminality fell well below that mid-point and could not justify the sentences which was imposed for Counts 1 and 2.


	
	In that case, after accepting that the sentencing standards in the late 1970s could be ascertained, the sentences imposed by this Court for four offences of indecent assault by the conduct summarised below were:
	
	
	Placing the victim’s hand on a penis and moving it up and down – a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months.
	
	
	Telling the victim to suck the offender’s penis “like a lollypop”, placing his hand on the back of her head and moving her head towards his penis (but stopping when the movement was resisted) – a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months.
	
	
	Lying behind the victim and fondling her breasts outside her clothing – a fixed term of imprisonment of 9 months.
	
	
	Lying behind the victim and pushing his penis against her buttocks and rubbing her vagina outside her clothing – a fixed term of imprisonment of 9 months.
	
	
	The commencing dates of the four sentences were structured so as to make an effective fixed term of 12 months. The complainant was the offender’s daughter. The first and second offences occurred on one occasion in 1972. The third and fourth offences occurred on another in the years 1977 – 1979 by which time the maximum penalty had been increased to 6 years imprisonment. MPB was also sentenced in respect of later offences but these are of no present relevance.
	
	
	In Bradbery v R [2008] NSWCCA 93 this Court allowed an appeal against sentence and re-sentenced the offender in respect of 4 counts of indecently assaulting his daughter, then aged between 8 and 12 years, on four occasions between 1 January 1970 and 27 April 1975. The first and third offences were constituted by the offender touching the outside of the complainant’s vagina. The second involved him placing the complainant’s hands on his penis and testicles and forcing her to rub them. The fourth offence was cunnilingus while masturbating.
	
	
	The sentences imposed by this Court were fixed terms of 6 months on each of the first three charges, accumulated so as to make an effective term of 8 months and in the case of the fourth charge imprisonment for 16 months including a non-parole period of 4 months. The total effective sentence was of imprisonment for 2 years including a non-parole period of 1 year.
	
	
	In both Bradbery v R and MPB v R the offender had pleaded guilty. If fixed terms of 6 months (or when the maximum penalty was higher, 9 months) were within an appropriate sentencing range for the touching or rubbing of vaginas or penises in those cases, the indicative sentences for similar conduct by the Applicant may well be the same and certainly should not be very substantially higher. And although the Applicant’s breach of trust was an aggravating factor, it was less than the breach of a father’s duty to his daughter as occurred in each of MPB v R and Bradbery v R.
	
	
	Consideration of the gravity of a number of the Applicant’s offences when compared with the statutory maximum penalty of 5 years and the range of conduct contemplated by the terms of s 76 of the Crimes Act as it then was leads to the same conclusion. As was the assessment in MPB v R, in my view most of the Applicant’s conduct fell well below the midpoint of seriousness of the conduct falling within s 76 and, when allowance is made for the Applicant’s plea, the indicative sentences for that conduct should be low on the scale. It must not be forgotten that any period in prison is a substantial punishment. The fact that offences 2 and 3 occurred on one occasion, that offences 8 and 9 did also and that the offences taken into account occurred at more or less the same time as offences 1 and 2, given the nature of them, tends to lessen the demand for accumulation consequent on those offences.
	
	
	It is also relevant to bear in mind that, as the decision in Magnuson v R [2013] NSWCCA 50 at [92]-[95] records, many and perhaps most offenders convicted of indecent assault prior to 1981 received non-custodial sentences. Given that the details of the offences reflected in the statistics referred to in that case are not apparent, that circumstance cannot be taken too far and in any event I would not regard non-custodial sentences as appropriate for the Applicant’s more serious offences. However, judged by the sentencing standards operating at the time of his offending, had the Applicant’s less serious offences stood alone non-custodial sentences for them may well have been imposed.
	
	
	I accept that the Applicant’s ejaculation on the occasion of two of his offences increased the seriousness of those two. More significant is the fact that a further two of the offences involved digital penetration of girls of, or not much above, the age of 7. I would not characterise those offences as low on the scale of offences falling within the statutory provision. Furthermore there were four victims, a factor which also argues for more rather than less accumulation.
	
	
	Weight must also be given to the Applicant’s rehabilitation – a finding which her Honour should have made. Not only was there the absence of any evidence of offending since 1978 but evidence that the Applicant had not offended against them was given by the Applicant’s step-daughter and own son and daughter who had all been young children while parented by him. A family friend whose children had also had regular contact with the Applicant also attested to those children being adamant that the Applicant had done nothing improper to them. None of this evidence was challenged.
	
	
	Two of the five purposes for which criminal punishment is imposed are rehabilitation of an offender and deterrence of him from re-offending - see Veen v The Queen [No 2] [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 so rehabilitation prior to sentencing argues significantly in favour of a lighter sentence than otherwise might be appropriate. – see Wright v R [2008] NSWCCA 91 at [14].
	
	
	In R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519 Street CJ, in a passage subsequently endorsed by the High Court in Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70;166 CLR 59 observed:
	


Moreover, where there has been a lengthy postponement, whether due to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier sentence, to the circumstance that he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for sentence on the subsequent occasion, and to the fact that sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls for a considerable measurement of understanding and flexibility of approach – passage of time between offence and sentenced, when lengthy, will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner.


	
	Also relevant are remarks of Howie J, with whom Fitzgerald JA agreed, in Moon v R [2000] NSWCCA 534; 117 A Crim R 497 at [81]:
	


In a case such as this where there has been such a lengthy delay between offence and sentence and where the offender is rehabilitated, it is the fact of imprisonment rather than the length of the sentence which will be of greatest significance to punish the offender and denounce his conduct. Although general deterrence is important it can never be allowed to dictate a sentence which is not proportionate to the offence committed or appropriate to punish the particular offender before the court.


	
	The passage was accepted in AJB v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 51; 169 A Crim R at 30.
	
	
	It remains to apply these various considerations in addition to other general sentencing principles to the circumstances of this case. In my view they lead to the following indicative sentences for the counts listed:-
	


(i)   Rubbing penis outside underpants and ejaculating –    8 months

(ii)   Rubbing penis against vagina –             6 months

(iii)   Forcing victim to touch penis –             6 months

(iv)   Rubbing penis against vagina and ejaculating –    8 months

(v)   Digital penetration –                18 months

(vi)   Touching boy’s penis –                4 months

(vii)   Touching boy’s penis outside clothes –          3 months

(viii)   Digital penetration –                2 years

(ix)   Touching genital area –                6 months


	
	The additional offences taken into account in determining the sentence for count 1 were of touching a vagina at the same time as offences (1) and (2).
	
	
	Of course the principle of totality and the fact that the hardship of a prison sentence is not simply proportional to its length mean that these periods should not simply be added together. Thus I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL that an aggregate sentence of 5 years imprisonment is appropriate.
	
	
	At the time of the Applicant’s offending the non-parole periods imposed were usually of the order of one-third to one-half of the head sentence - MPB v R at [93]. In the circumstances of this case, and in particular the Applicant’s rehabilitation and remarks in some of the earlier cases that I have quoted, I regard it as appropriate to adopt the top of this range but not go beyond it. Accordingly, I would impose a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months. The sentencing practice at the time of the Applicant’s offending constitutes special circumstances justifying a departure from the ratio set forth in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

2768729,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 21) [2016] NSWSC 24,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: At the trial of the Accused, A2, KM and Shabbir Mohammedbhai Vaziri, the Crown called two children, C1 and C2, to give evidence in the Crown case.
	
	
	The nature of the charges brought against the Accused persons, and the role of C1 and C2 as witnesses in the trial, may be discerned sufficiently from my judgment of 8 September 2015: R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 4) [2015] NSWSC 1306. In that judgment, I determined that C2 was competent to give sworn evidence at the trial, and I overruled an objection made by C1 and C2 under s.18 Evidence Act 1995 to giving evidence in the trial where their mother, A2, was an Accused person.
	


Pretrial Ruling Concerning Suggested Leading Questions and s.37 Evidence Act 1995


	
	In advance of the trial, objection was taken on behalf of the Accused persons to parts of the recorded interviews of each child which were said to contain leading questions. The recorded interview of each child was to be played to the jury as part of the evidence-in-chief of the witness, pursuant to ss.306U and 306V Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	To the extent that any question used in the recorded interviews was held to be a leading question, the Crown sought leave under s.37 Evidence Act 1995 to permit leading questions to be used in the examination-in-chief of the witness.
	
	
	Written submissions were provided on behalf of the Accused persons and the Crown on these issues (Pretrial MFIs 40 and 41).
	
	
	At the conclusion of submissions on this aspect on 10 September 2015, I announced my ruling in the following terms (PT732):
	


“On the defence objection to certain questions and answers of C1 and C2 during their recorded interviews of 29 August 2012, I am not persuaded that each of the questions objected to are leading questions for the purpose of the Evidence Act 1995. To the extent that any particular question is capable of being characterised as a leading question, having considered factors under s 192 of the Evidence Act 1995, I grant leave to the Crown under s 37(1)(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 to ask that question with respect to each of C1 and C2.

Accordingly, I overrule the objections to the challenged parts of the recorded interviews of 29 August 2012 of C1 and C2. I will publish my reasons at a later time for this ruling.”

Trial Rulings Concerning s.42 Evidence Act 1995


	
	C1 was called as the first witness in the trial. She gave evidence by way of closed-circuit television with her evidence-in-chief being constituted substantially by her recorded interview.
	
	
	The Crown made application under s.42 Evidence Act 1995 seeking to restrict the use of leading questions in cross-examination of each of C1 and C2 (MFI4).
	
	
	Submissions were made by counsel on the s.42 application. At the conclusion of argument, I stated that I would give more detailed reasons for the ruling at a later time. However, for the assistance of counsel and to allow the trial to proceed directly before the jury, I said (T112-113):
	


“I will give more detailed reasons for this ruling at a later time. However, for the assistance of counsel at this time I indicate that with respect to the cross examination by Mr Bouveng on behalf of the accused [KM] that I am satisfied that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used with respect to the subject matters referred to in paragraph 3 of the Crown's written submissions which relate to what is really the sole issue in dispute in this trial. Those are what happened to [C1] before, during and after the alleged FGM procedure, [C1’s] understanding of khatna, how [C1] felt during, before and after the procedure and any conversation that [C1] may have had with any third parties, including relatives, about the alleged FGM procedure. I exclude from that the investigating officials who interviewed her on 29 August 2012.

I note in this respect that if Mr Bouveng commences his cross examination with the use of non leading questions that will, I trust, allow the Court to understand what the position of the witness is in response to the facts in issue on the critical issue. I note that this ruling does not stop Mr Bouveng from drawing the witness' attention to a particular question or answer in the interview. That is not a leading question but an introductory question which would then lead to the next question which, for the first part at least, should not be a leading question.

I note that this issue may be revisited in the light of the answers given by [C1] to Mr Bouveng in cross examination in response to non leading questions. In particular, if [C1] maintains the account given in the recorded interview, MFI 2, it would be appropriate for Mr Bouveng to have an opportunity to put his client's instructions to [C1] at what would be the last phase of his cross examination. However, whether that position is to be reached will depend upon what the witness says in response to non leading questions. If the position is reached where counsel seek to raise with me that scenario where Mr Bouveng should be permitted to ask leading questions to put instructions, then it should be indicated that there is a further question of law, I will ask the jury to leave and I will deal with this promptly.

I note that Mr Sutherland SC has indicated that whether he seeks to cross examine the witness at all will be dependant [sic] upon the cross examination of Mr Bouveng, so I do not at this stage say anything with respect to the possible cross examination by Mr Sutherland SC for the other accused.

I hope that what I have said makes sufficiently clear what the position is in the first phase, at least.”


	
	Following the evidence of C1, in which cross-examination on behalf of the Accused persons did not seek leave under the second-phase approach referred to in my judgment, the Crown called C2 to give evidence. Further submissions were made by counsel concerning the Crown application under s.42 Evidence Act 1995 with respect to C2.
	
	
	Following those submissions, I gave short reasons for granting the Crown s.42 application, and foreshadowed that more detailed reasons would be provided at a later time. The short reasons concerning C2 were as follows (T168-169):
	


“At the conclusion of submissions yesterday on the Crown's application under section 42 of the Evidence Act 1995 that leading questions not be allowed on four topics with respect to the witnesses [C1] and [C2], I expressed at pages 111 to 113 of the transcript a ruling with an indication that I would provide more elaborate reasons for this ruling at a later time. I propose to adopt the same approach as that taken yesterday and as expressed at that point in transcript with respect to the witness [C2] who is now giving evidence. It is not necessary to repeat all that was said in those pages of the transcript, but it can be taken that that will be the approach which I take.

I note that in relation to the evidence yesterday of [C1] the point was not reached where Mr Bouveng sought to ask leading questions and thus the second phase, if I could use that term, did not arise. If the second phase was going to arise in the case of [C2], then it would be appropriate that counsel indicate that there is a legal issue, I will invite the jury to withdraw, I hope for a very short period, just to confirm the parameters of what was to happen next. 

Whether that arises or not depends obviously upon the course of cross examination which will be undertaken up to that point. I express those short reasons for a ruling.”


	
	Cross-examination of C2 was brief, with leave under the second phase not being sought (T177-185).
	
	
	This judgment contains my detailed reasons for the rulings made on 10, 16 and 17 September 2015.
	


Relevant Statutory Provisions


	
	Section 37 Evidence Act 1995 concerns the use of leading questions in examination-in-chief. The section provides:
	


“37    Leading questions

(1)    A leading question must not be put to a witness in examination in chief or in re-examination unless:

(a)    the court gives leave, or

(b)    the question relates to a matter introductory to the witness’s evidence, or

(c)    no objection is made to the question and (leaving aside the party conducting the examination in chief or re-examination) each other party to the proceeding is represented by an Australian legal practitioner, legal counsel or prosecutor, or

(d)    the question relates to a matter that is not in dispute, or

(e)    if the witness has specialised knowledge based on the witness’s training, study or experience—the question is asked for the purpose of obtaining the witness’s opinion about a hypothetical statement of facts, being facts in respect of which evidence has been, or is intended to be, given.

(2)    Unless the court otherwise directs, subsection (1) does not apply in civil proceedings to a question that relates to an investigation, inspection or report that the witness made in the course of carrying out public or official duties.

(3)    Subsection (1) does not prevent a court from exercising power under rules of court to allow a written statement or report to be tendered or treated as evidence in chief of its maker.”


	
	Section 42 is concerned with the restriction on the use of leading questions in cross-examination. Section 42 provides:
	


“42    Leading questions

(1)    A party may put a leading question to a witness in cross-examination unless the court disallows the question or directs the witness not to answer it.

(2)    Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to disallow the question or give such a direction, it is to take into account the extent to which:

(a)    evidence that has been given by the witness in examination in chief is unfavourable to the party who called the witness, and

(b)    the witness has an interest consistent with an interest of the cross-examiner, and

(c)    the witness is sympathetic to the party conducting the cross-examination, either generally or about a particular matter, and

(d)    the witness’s age, or any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the witness is subject, may affect the witness’s answers.

(3)    The court is to disallow the question, or direct the witness not to answer it, if the court is satisfied that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used.

(4)    This section does not limit the court’s power to control leading questions.”


	
	The term “leading question” is defined in the Dictionary to the Act in the following way:
	


“leading question means a question asked of a witness that:

(a)    directly or indirectly suggests a particular answer to the question, or

(b)    assumes the existence of a fact the existence of which is in dispute in the proceeding and as to the existence of which the witness has not given evidence before the question is asked.”


	
	The term “examination in chief” lies within clause 2 of Part 2 of the Dictionary to the Act:
	


“(1)    A reference in this Act to examination in chief of a witness is a reference to the questioning of a witness by the party who called the witness to give evidence, not being questioning that is re-examination.

(2)    A reference in this Act to cross-examination of a witness is a reference to the questioning of a witness by a party other than the party who called the witness to give evidence.

(3)    A reference in this Act to re-examination of a witness is a reference to the questioning of a witness by the party who called the witness to give evidence, being questioning (other than further examination in chief with the leave of the court) conducted after the cross-examination of the witness by another party.

(4)    If a party has recalled a witness who has already given evidence, a reference in this Act to re-examination of a witness does not include a reference to the questioning of the witness by that party before the witness is questioned by another party.”


	
	To the extent that s.37(1)(a) involves a grant of leave by the Court, s.192 is pertinent. That provision states:
	


“192    Leave, permission or direction may be given on terms

(1)    If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.

(2)    Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:

(a)    the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and

(b)    the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and

(c)    the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and

(d)    the nature of the proceeding, and

(e)    the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.”

The Objection to Leading Questions in the Recorded Interviews of C1 and C2 and the Crown’s Application for Leave Under s.37 With Respect to Any Leading Questions


	
	Counsel for the Accused persons objected to the following parts of the recorded interview with C1, upon the basis that leading questions were asked in examination-in-chief (Exhibit PT11):
	


“Q389 [Investigating official] Well, I heard that it means, um, that it’s something that some young girls have, and that it’s like a type of cutting to the private part.

A [C1]. Yeah, it is.

Q390 It is. How do you know that?

A. Because it’s happened to me.

Q391 Because it’s happened to you. When did it happen to you?

A. When I was the age of seven.

…

Q603 Yeah, ah, just one question. Are you able to explain exactly what happens ---

A. Nuh-uh.

Q604 --- in your words.

A. No. Well, they give um, a little cut there. No, not very much, because I’m not used to talking about it either, because, um, my mum tells me not to go around telling everyone that much. That’s all.

Q605 OK. When, when you say, um, they, they give a little cut there, where do, what do you mean by there?

A. In your private part.”


	
	Objection was taken upon the same basis to part of the recorded interview with C2 (Exhibit PT12):
	


“Q194 [Investigating official]  We heard that, that that word [khatna] means something that some young girls have, O.K., where they have a cut to their private parts. Tell me what you know about that?

A [C2]. I don’t know.

Q195 You don’t know or you don’t want to tell me?

A. I don’t know what that is.

Q196 Pardon?

A. I don’t know what that is.

Q197 You don’t know what that is. We heard that you had a cut on your private parts. Is that true?

A. Yes.

Q198 Yeah. When was that?

A. I don’t know.

Q199 You don’t know when it was. Where were you when that happened?

A. Home.

Q200 At home. And who else was at home?

A. I don’t know.”


	
	It was submitted that Q389 (in the case of C1) and Q194 and Q197 (in the case of C2), in particular, were leading questions, with a flow-on effect into subsequent questions so as to render them leading questions as well.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Accused persons that the Crown should not be granted leave under s.37(1)(a) to adduce this evidence by way of leading questions. By reference to s.192 of the Act, it was submitted that:
	



	
	the granting of leave to the Crown to “ask” these questions in the recorded interviews of C1 and C2, instead of the questions and answers being deleted from the interviews and being asked in a permissible method by the Crown, will only shorten the length of the hearing by a small extent: s.192(2)(a);
	
	
	a grant of leave as sought by the Crown would be unfair to both the witnesses and to each of the Accused persons where the questions suggested that the gravamen of the offence in s.45 Crimes Act 1900 had occurred to C1 and C2: s.192(2)(b) - reference was made to the ages of C1 (eight years old) and C2 (six years old with a mild intellectual disability) at the time of each interview, with reference also being made to the reports of psychologists, Dr Susan Pulman, Dr Gary Banks and Ms Alison O’Neill (Exhibit PT13), being supportive of the use of non-leading questions in the interviewing of children: s.192(2)(b);
	
	
	the questions asked related to the ultimate (and only) facts in issue in the trial, namely what was the nature of the procedure performed on C1 and C2 by KM - it was submitted that the evidence can easily be adduced in a permissible fashion by the use of non-leading questions by the Crown: s.192(2)(c).
	



	
	The Crown submitted that the questions objected to, when viewed in context, were not leading questions (Pretrial MFI41). Should the Court hold that any of the questions were leading questions, the Crown submitted that leave should be granted under s.37(1)(a) for that evidence to form part of the examination-in-chief of each of C1 and C2.
	
	
	The Crown referred to parts of the interviews of C1 and C2, before and after the questions which drew the objection. It was submitted that the impugned questions must be seen in context in each case, with that process supporting a grant of leave under s.37(1)(a) with respect to each of C1 and C2.
	
	
	For the purposes of s.192(2), the Crown submitted that the evidence was important and that the subject matter of the questions concerning intimate parts of each child was relevant. It was emphasised that the proceedings were against the mother of C1 and C2, with whom they both lived.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it would not be unfair to a party or either witness to grant leave under s.37(1)(a).
	


Reasons for s.37 Ruling


	
	It may be taken that s.37 Evidence Act 1995 applies to questions asked in a recorded interview which is to be tendered as part of a child’s evidence-in-chief by way of ss.306U and 306V Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Although some rules of evidence are relaxed by s.306V(1), s.306V(4) makes clear that the Court may rule as inadmissible the whole or any part of the contents of a recording adduced as evidence under these provisions. It is notable, however, that such objections do not relate to a question asked in Court by counsel. Those circumstances attract an objection, followed by submissions and a ruling. In that context, of course, an application for leave under s.37 may be considered in the dynamic context of the trial itself while the witness is giving oral evidence.
	
	
	Here, the questions under challenge were asked in the course of an investigatory interview undertaken with each of C1 and C2 more than three years before. Because of the provisions contained in ss.306U and 306V Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the questions and answers in the recorded interviews may become part of the evidence-in-chief of the relevant vulnerable person.
	
	
	This does not mean that the prohibition contained in the Evidence Act 1995, upon the use of leading questions in examination-in-chief, does not apply. Clearly, the provision has application as the contents of the interview become part of the evidence-in-chief of the witness. Other bases of objection might also arise in a particular case. In this case, the only objection taken to the questions referred to at [19] and [20] above was made upon the basis of the use of leading questions.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Q/A389 (in the case of C1) and Q/A194 and 197 (in the case of C2) constitute leading questions within the definition of that term in the Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	I am not so satisfied with respect to the balance of the questions which are objected to upon the same basis. The other questions under challenge do not, in my view, fall within the terms of the statutory definition.
	
	
	In the case of C1 (Q/A390-391; Q/A603-605), the questions are not leading and it could not be fairly concluded that they are somehow tainted by a type of flow-on effect. Both the words used in questions and answers, and the appearance of C1 in the video-recorded interview, support such a characterisation.
	
	
	A similar conclusion should be reached concerning C2, although she was more tentative in her appearance in the recorded interview.
	
	
	The question then arises as to whether the Crown should have leave under s.37(1)(a) of the Act to (in effect, retrospectively) adduce such evidence by means of a leading question. It has been observed that a ruling concerning the use of leading questions involves the exercise of discretion in the particular case by the trial Judge: Heydon, “Cross on Evidence”, 10th Australian edition, paragraphs [17,155]-[17,160].
	
	
	In exercising discretion under s.37(1)(a), in the context of a s.306U recorded interview, it is important to bear in mind the nature of the interview being undertaken, the age of the person being interviewed and to consider the particular question or questions under objection against the background of the interview in its entirety. It should be kept in mind that the interview is part of an investigatory process, although its potential use under ss.306U and 306V is also important.
	
	
	Likewise, it is most important that the interview was video recorded, so that the jury was in a position to see and hear the conversation, and to form a view as to the significance (if any) of any leading question.
	
	
	Having assessed the entirety of the recorded interview with C1, I was satisfied that leave ought be granted to the Crown to adduce evidence in the one leading question which I have identified. At the time of the interview, C1 was about nine years old. The question under challenge lay in the midst of a lengthy recorded conversation with the investigating officials.
	
	
	Fairly read, the recorded conversation involved a developing willingness of C1 to open up to the questioners in a number of respects. The interview took place against the background that C1 had been told by her mother not to discuss the topic of what had happened on the occasion of the alleged circumcision. The interview discloses an increasing willingness of C1 to talk to the investigators, mentioning at one stage that she (C1) felt “safe” (Q/A223). Although the interview progressed some way without C1 readily being prepared to discuss the event under consideration, she did so in a convincing and plausible fashion after the questions under objection. Nearly all the factual matters referred to by her were not disputed.
	
	
	It was also relevant to the exercise of discretion, for the purpose of ss.37 and 192, that further evidence to be adduced by the Crown involved conversations with others which referred to the fact that C1 had mentioned that she had been “cut”.
	
	
	In my view, the particular vice which has been identified with the use of leading questions does not arise in any realistic way in this case. Further, to excise a small part of a lengthy interview, and to proceed with the Crown having to ask a non-leading question on one topic out of a long interview, would involve an unrealistic process which would not serve the purpose of adducing relevant and meaningful evidence, in particular from a child by that time aged some 12 years. As observed earlier, the jury was in a position to form its own view concerning the significance (if any) of the leading question, given that a contemporaneous video recording was relied upon by the Crown.
	
	
	I was satisfied that it would not be unfair to any party or the witness to grant leave: s.192(2)(b). The evidence was important to the Crown case: s.192(2)(c). The refusal of leave would likely have extended the hearing: s.192(2)(a).
	
	
	For these reasons, I determined that the use of the leading question (identified above at [30]) ought be permitted by way of a grant of leave under s.37(1)(a) Evidence Act 1995 with respect to C1.
	
	
	In considering the leave issue with respect to C2, I had regard, as well, to the fact that she volunteered later in the interview that she felt “hurting … in my bottom” (Q/A232-233). The jury could assess this, as well, in considering the earlier reference to being “cut”.
	
	
	I was satisfied, having regard to ss.37 and 192, that leave ought be granted to the Crown to adduce this evidence from C2. My reasoning for this conclusion was similar to that expressed with respect to C1. This was an objection to certain questions in the course of an investigatory interview with a child, then aged six years. The jury could see and hear the interview, and form their own view concerning the role of the leading questions in the course of a long interview.
	
	
	In reaching these conclusions concerning C1 and C2, I had regard to the evidence of psychologists to which the Court was taken. I considered the opinions of the psychologists having taken into account the entirety of the interview with each child independently.
	


Crown Objection Under s.42 Evidence 1995 to the Use of Leading Questions in Certain Areas in the Cross-Examination of C1 and C2


	
	The Crown submitted that there ought be a limit upon the use of leading questions in the cross-examination of C1 and C2 with respect to four identified topics:
	



	
	what happened to each of them before, during and after the alleged female genital mutilation (“FGM”) procedure;
	
	
	the understanding of each child of the term “khatna”;
	
	
	the description of each child as to what she felt during, before and after the procedure; and
	
	
	any conversation that each child may have had with third parties (especially family members) about the FGM procedure.
	



	
	The Crown submitted that there was some evidence that A1, the father of C1 and C2, had sought to influence the children (and, in particular, C1) on the afternoon of the interviews with the children on 29 August 2012. In this respect, the Court was taken to a conversation in a motor vehicle between A1 and C1 on that afternoon which was recorded by way of surveillance device. The Crown relied, as well, upon a recorded conversation between the mother, A2, and C1 and C2 where she discussed what had been asked of each of them in the interview earlier that day, and chided them for discussing what had happened (Exhibit AD, page 8).
	
	
	The Crown relied, as well, upon s.42(2)(d), noting the age of each child and some evidence of mild intellectual disability on the part of C2.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Court should be satisfied that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used on these topics during cross-examination of C1 and C2 by counsel for the Accused persons.
	
	
	Counsel for the Accused persons opposed the making of any order s.42 restricting their capacity to use leading questions in cross-examination. It was submitted that a proper basis had not been demonstrated for such an order.
	


Reasons for s.42 Ruling


	
	In determining this question, I had regard, in particular, to the age of C1 and C2 and the material before the Court concerning the mild intellectual disability of C2: s.42(2)(d).
	
	
	In circumstances where the evidence-in-chief of each of C1 and C2 was to be constituted primarily by their recorded interviews made some three years before, I considered that this was a case where the use of s.42 was appropriate. In this respect, it was relevant that C1 and C2 were living with their parents, A1 and A2, so that additional care was warranted in the ascertainment of facts by means of questions asked in Court on behalf of the Accused persons.
	
	
	It was significant that A2, the mother, had spoken to each of C1 and C2 on the afternoon of 29 August 2012 and said the following concerning the interviews (Exhibit AD, page 5):
	


“You told them everything. I told you not to say, any one. I told you not to say. Now we are in trouble because of this. I told you this is a big secret. This is what she came to find out. Now we are in trouble because of that. We told you my child this is a big secret, never tell anyone.”


	
	There was evidence, as well, that A2, her husband, A1, and KM had advanced or embraced a false story at different times, in the form of the “Africa checking story”.
	
	
	Evidence of this type supported a conclusion that “the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used” (at least in the first instance) in cross-examination.
	
	
	There was a live question as to whether C1 and C2 would fall within s.42(2)(b) and (c), with the use of non-leading questions allowing the Court to consider these aspects further.
	
	
	As was pointed out by Mr Bouveng, counsel for KM, it remained important that he have the ability, depending upon the answers given to him by each of C1 and C2 in answer to non-leading questions, to challenge each witness by use of leading questions so that he could contradict their accounts in a manner that allowed him to put his client’s version before the witness, in accordance with the principle in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67.
	
	
	As indicated in the extracts containing my rulings at [9] and [11] above, I considered that a two-phase approach was appropriate given the subject matter of the questions and the particular factors existing in this case, where each child witness had been living since August 2012 with their parents, one of whom was on trial for the alleged offences said to have been committed against the girls.
	
	
	I was satisfied, for the purpose of s.42(3), that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used in the cross-examination of each of C1 and C2 initially. Proceeding in this way allowed counsel for the Accused persons to ask questions which elicited a response to relevant matters, with the capacity to revisit the s.42 ruling by way of a second phase of questioning (using leading questions) if the Court considered that appropriate.
	
	
	In the event, neither Mr Bouveng nor Mr Sutherland SC asked questions moving beyond the first phase allowed in my ruling. Neither considered it necessary, in the circumstances of the evidence of each of C1 and C2, to seek to cross-examine by way of leading questions so as to confront each witness with a suggested contrary account.
	
	
	I record my view that the practical outcome of the ruling made by me under s.42, with respect to C1 and C2, meant that facts were better ascertained by counsel for the Accused persons using non-leading questions. The fact that defence counsel did not feel it necessary to revisit the s.42 ruling, by way of a second-phase argument, confirmed my conclusion that the approach permitted counsel to question each witness in a manner that was consistent with a fair opportunity to adduce evidence from each child.
	


Conclusion


	
	It was for the reasons here expressed with respect to the ss.37 and 42 issues, that I made the rulings on those topics set out earlier in this judgment.

		08 February 2016",2016-02-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768733,Efthimiadis v R (No 2) [2016] NSWCCA 9,"Judgment


	
	PRICE J: After a jury trial in the District Court at Gosford, the applicant was convicted on 4 September 2009 of soliciting a New South Wales Police Undercover Operative to murder the victim contrary to s 26 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	The maximum penalty for solicit to murder is imprisonment for 25 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge O’Connor QC (‘the sentencing judge’) to imprisonment for 13 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 10 years, commencing on 17 December 2007 and expiring on 16 December 2017, with a parole period of 3 years 4 months expiring 16 April 2021.
	
	
	The applicant seeks an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against sentence. The sole ground of appeal is expressed as follows:
	
	
	“The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120.”
	


Should an extension of time be granted?


	
	In February 2010, the applicant lodged a Notice of Intention to appeal against conviction and sentence, which did not proceed and subsequently lapsed. The applicant had applied for legal aid for the purpose of the appeal but was refused.
	
	
	Following the judgment in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, the applicant’s case was reviewed by the Legal Aid Commission and a Notice of Application for Extension of Time to file a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal against sentence was filed in this Court.
	
	
	On 14 November 2013, this Court refused the application: Efthimiadis v R [2013] NSWCCA 276 (per Johnson J, with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Latham J agreed) – hereafter conveniently referred to as ‘the first appeal’.
	
	
	The present application for an extension of time for leave to appeal against sentence was filed on 12 June 2015. The application is founded upon the contention that Johnson J applied the principle of ‘substantial injustice’ in considering the first appeal, that by doing so his Honour was applying the approach adopted in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 which the High Court of Australia held in Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 to be wrongly decided. The applicant referred to what was said by Johnson J at [10]:
	


“The principles to be applied on an application for an extension of time such as this were considered by the Court in Abdul v R at [42]-[53]. Those principles will be applied in determining the present application for extension of time.”


	
	The Crown argues that Johnson J did not, in the first appeal, apply incorrect principles, and that the appeal was determined on its merits according to the law (as subsequently stated in Kentwell) and as such the disposition of the first application should constitute a “discretionary bar” to the present application.
	
	
	The Crown submits that this is an unusual case where despite Johnson J initially stating that the Abdul principles would be applied in determining the application; what his Honour proceeded to do was not in fact impose a substantial injustice test but instead comply with what was subsequently outlined in Kentwell as the correct process to be followed in determining such an application. The Crown referred to his Honour’s detailed consideration of the objective gravity of the offence, the applicant’s subjective features and his reference to sentencing statistics, other sentencing judgments and the post-sentence evidence adduced on the application. Particular reference was made by the Crown to Johnson J’s conclusions at [80] and [82]:
	


“Utilising the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period as guideposts, in accordance with the principles in Muldrock, and having regard to all matters relevant to the question of sentence, a conclusion should not be reached that a lesser period of imprisonment ought be imposed upon the Applicant for this crime.”

…

“If an extension of time had been granted in this case and leave to appeal had also been granted, a conclusion would have been reached that no lesser sentence was warranted for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.”


	
	In reply, the applicant contends that it is a curious submission for the Crown to make that Johnson J would initially refer to Abdul and then proceed to ignore the principles set out in that judgment. The applicant submits that the Abdul principles that were subsequently found to be wrongly decided infected the whole of Johnson J’s judgment. The applicant contends that the decision of this Court in the first appeal to refuse the applicant an extension of time to seek leave to appeal against sentence does not create a “jurisdictional bar” to the present application.
	
	
	As in the first appeal, the Crown concedes “Muldrock error”. This concession was succinctly discussed in the first appeal by Johnson J at [11]:
	


“The Crown concedes that the sentencing Judge approached the sentencing of the Applicant upon a basis which did not comply with the decision in Muldrock. This concession was appropriately made. In accordance with the law as it stood, his Honour was satisfied that the matter fell within the mid-range of offences of this type. After considering a range of other matters relevant to sentence, his Honour returned to the standard non-parole period and said (ROS 18-19):

""The standard non-parole period is intended for a middle range case where the offender has been convicted after trial, R v Way. The court is required to impose the standard non-parole period unless it determines there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard period, Section 44B(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

The reasons for the setting of a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are those referred to in Section 21A. I am of the opinion that a standard non-parole period is applicable in this case. The reason for so finding is that I am of the opinion that the offence is in the mid-range of objective seriousness for the reasons referred to.

Secondly, apart from lack of evidence of substantial harm to the intended victim there are no other mitigating factors of relevance in Section 21A. Indeed as mentioned there are a number of aggravating factors.

Finally as mentioned I do not regard the case as warranting a finding of special circumstances so as to affect the applicability of the standard non-parole period.""


	
	In Lowe v R [2015] NSWCCA 46, this Court (Ward JA, Simpson and Davies JJ) determined that the refusal of an application for leave to appeal is not a jurisdictional bar to a subsequent application. However, Simpson J observed at [7]:
	


“The grant (or refusal) of leave to appeal is a discretionary decision. Refusal of leave to appeal does not create a jurisdictional bar to any further proceedings. If it be the case that a second (or subsequent) application for leave to appeal raises issues that have been determined on the merits in a previous application, that provides a powerful basis for the exercise of the discretion against a grant of leave.”


	
	Lowe concerned a refusal of an application for leave to appeal against sentence, as opposed to the present case which concerns an application for an extension of time. In my opinion, there is no good reason why the principle in Lowe should not apply to the present application.
	
	
	Accordingly, the decision of this Court in the first appeal does not amount to a jurisdictional bar, but the question remains whether this Court should exercise its discretion against a grant of leave.
	


Decision


	
	In Kentwell, the High Court (French CJ, Hayne, Bell, Gageler and Keane JJ) determined that the substantial injustice test formulated in Abdul was misplaced. The High Court said at [30]:
	


“…The wide discretion conferred on the Court of Criminal Appeal under the Act and Rules is to be exercised by consideration of what the interests of justice require in the particular case. Abdul was wrongly decided. It was an error to introduce in applications for an extension of time based on asserted ""Muldrock error"" consideration of whether refusal of the application would occasion substantial injustice.”


	
	It is true, as the Crown submits, that Johnson J gave more than a summary assessment of the strength of the applicant’s appeal but that does not mean that his Honour did not apply the substantial injustice test. The Crown acknowledged it was a “bold” argument to submit that whilst his Honour specifically referred to the application of the Abdul test, incorrect principles were not applied.
	
	
	In any event, relevant to the determination of the interests of justice on an application for an extension of time are the prospects of success should the extension be granted: Kentwell at [33]. This Court has a deal of material before it, including up to date evidence of the applicant’s progress in custody which suggests that the applicant’s appeal cannot be said to have no prospects of success.
	
	
	This is not a case where all the issues raised in the appeal were determined on the merits according to law on the first appeal. It appears that the substantial injustice test was applied. Furthermore, a focal point in the proceedings on sentence before the sentencing judge and in this appeal was in his Honour’s assessment that the applicant’s offence fell within the mid-range offence of solicit to murder. This assessment was not challenged in the first appeal: Efthimiadis at [60]. The Crown’s argument that this Court should exercise its discretion and not grant an extension of time should be rejected. The reasons for the applicant’s delay have been explained and the interests of justice require, in my opinion, that an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against sentence be granted.
	
	
	As Muldrock error is conceded by the Crown, it is necessary for this Court to exercise its own sentencing discretion. Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) provides:
	


“On an appeal… against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.”


	
	Specific error being identified, it is this Court’s duty to re-sentence, “unless in the separate and independent exercise of its discretion it concludes that no different sentence should be passed”: Kentwell at [35]. This Court is obliged to take into account “all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing”: Kentwell at [43].
	


Facts


	
	Before venturing further, it is convenient to detail the findings of fact made by the sentencing judge. Those findings were based upon the evidence in the trial and are not challenged by the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant was 42 years old at the time of the offence in December 2006. He was born and raised in Australia to Greek parents.
	
	
	The intended victim of the offence was his partner. He had met her when she was 16 years old, he then being in his late thirties. They had one child from the relationship, a boy who was two years old at the time of the offence.
	
	
	The applicant had two previous relationships with women. From the first of those relationships, there were two children and there was one child from the second relationship. All of those children remained in the United Kingdom in the custody of their mothers.
	
	
	The applicant had a criminal record at the time of the commission of the offence, a serious drug addiction and he also abused prescription medication.
	
	
	He was on parole and had been convicted of a further offence. Breach action was initiated; however, the applicant absconded to Queensland to avoid apprehension. The applicant lived in that State with the victim and their son.
	
	
	The relationship between the applicant and the victim deteriorated as a consequence of the applicant’s abuse of drugs and the arguments that ensued. The victim left the applicant with their son and returned to New South Wales to live with her uncle on the Central Coast. This resulted in further tension, the applicant being reluctant to return to New South Wales for fear of apprehension by way of outstanding warrant.
	
	
	The applicant returned to New South Wales on 10 December 2006. Whilst he was waiting for a train at Central Railway Station, the applicant coincidently ran into a person who he had known for some 20 years, having met him in prison. This person ultimately became a police informer and was referred to at trial and sentence as Mr X. When speaking to Mr X at the railway station, the applicant disclosed the difficulties he was having with his relationship, and that his partner had left him taking their son.
	
	
	It was the applicant’s case at trial that Mr X suggested that the victim be killed as a way to overcome his domestic problems and that he was in a position to provide the name of someone who could do it. It was also the applicant’s case that he was in fear of Mr X, that he had breached an undertaking to supply prohibited drugs to him and that he merely went along with Mr X’s suggestion as his reputation for violence was such that the applicant did not want to disagree with him. The applicant said that at no time did he intend to murder his partner.
	
	
	The sentencing judge observed that the jury had rejected the applicant’s claim that he did not intend to murder the victim and was acting under duress from Mr X.
	
	
	On 11 December 2006, Mr X contacted the police informing them that the applicant was seeking the services of a person to murder the victim. A controlled operation was authorised and an undercover officer (‘B’) telephoned the applicant.
	
	
	Authorisations were obtained to intercept the telephone conversations. Telephone conversations, mainly between the applicant, the victim and ‘B’ were recorded between 13 and 23 December 2006.
	
	
	The sentencing judge recounted that the telephone conversations between the applicant and the victim occurred over many hours. His Honour observed that during those conversations the applicant sounded emotional, often crying, explaining in a number of those conversations that he was suffering from withdrawal and taking Subutex. He wanted the victim to return to Queensland, which she refused to do. His return to Sydney was discussed and whilst the applicant expressed concern about being apprehended, the victim was content for him to see her and their son if he did return.
	
	
	In a recording on 14 December 2006, the applicant told ‘B’ that he was “keen to get the car fixed.” The applicant agreed in his evidence at trial that this was a reference to having the victim murdered.
	
	
	During a conversation recorded on 15 December 2006, the applicant told ‘B’ that he was “a hundred per cent keen” for the arrangement to be carried out. Subsequent conversations between the applicant and ‘B’ discussed arrangements for the applicant to meet ‘B’ in New South Wales.
	
	
	On 23 December 2006, the applicant travelled from Queensland to meet ‘B’ at Wyong Station. The applicant got into ‘B’s’ motor vehicle and asked him to drive to Wyee Station. The conversation in the motor vehicle was recorded by means of an in-car video. In the course of the journey, the applicant discussed a number of scenarios, the intention being for the applicant to get custody of his son to the exclusion of the victim.
	
	
	The initial conversation was to the effect that the applicant wanted ‘B’ to arrange an accident resulting in the victim being disabled to the extent of being put in a wheelchair such that she would no longer be able to care for their son. Money was discussed.
	
	
	The applicant said that he expected to pay between $10,000.00 and $15,000.00, and he would raise this money by doing an armed robbery.
	
	
	When discussing the matter with ‘B’, the applicant told him he had been thinking of “so many ways” to do it. He told ‘B’ that he wanted it done “probably in three weeks” and that he would give ‘B’ a call and say words to the effect “Ready to go.”
	
	
	The following exchange took place between the applicant and ‘B’:
	


‘B’ – “But all you said is like all you’ve said to me is that you want her – you want her disabled. You don’t want her to walk but….”

Applicant – “I’d rather – it’s difficult you know, I’d rather if she was gone. It would be better for me if she was gone you know. Because I – I don’t think we’re going to last anyway, the way things are going. yeah, and I’ll be – it’ll be possible for me to get the kid and you know what I mean.”


	
	Later in conversation, the following was said:
	


‘B’ – “So you want her put in a cemetery or you want her put in hospital”

Applicant – “A cemetery.”


	
	The applicant provided ‘B’ with a photograph of the victim, directions including the address where she was renting and a description of her motor vehicle and registration number.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested and charged on 23 December 2006 with bail being refused. At the time of his arrest, the applicant was in breach of parole for an offence of aggravated break and enter and commit felony in company.
	
	
	From 24 December 2006 to 7 October 2007, the applicant was serving the balance of parole for that offence, being a period of nine months and 14 days.
	
	
	Between 18 July 2007 and 17 December 2007, the applicant served a five month sentence of imprisonment for four counts of goods in custody.
	
	
	The applicant has been in custody solely for the offence of solicit to murder since 17 December 2007, and the sentence imposed for that offence commenced on that day.
	


Subjective circumstances


	
	The applicant did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence but a pre-sentence report was tendered. The report disclosed that the applicant was born and raised in Australia and was the middle of three siblings. The applicant described his upbringing as turbulent and how, as an adolescent, he began to gravitate towards an anti-social peer group in order to achieve acceptance and in doing so found notoriety in offending behaviour.
	
	
	He left school prior to the completion of Year 9, at the age of 15. His first significant employment, which was with the State Rail Authority, was terminated because of a criminal conviction.
	
	
	The applicant described a lengthy history of poly-substance abuse, advising that he commenced using heroin, cannabis and prescription medication from the age of 18 years. He also detailed periods of intravenous amphetamine use and advised the author of the pre-sentence report (‘the author’) that he had begun to experiment with methamphetamines (ice) prior to the commission of the present offence.
	
	
	The author observed that the applicant had served a total of eight prison sentences and had been in custody for almost 12 of the past 20 years. The applicant had not successfully completed any of the five parole orders imposed and had repeatedly relapsed to drug use, re-offended and moved interstate without permission. The applicant’s claim that he had re-assessed his motivation to engage in community corrections, advising that at 45 years of age he no longer desired a criminal lifestyle, was noted. The author observed (PSR 6):
	


“Whilst this proposition is to be commended, it is also considered that [the applicant] would benefit from ongoing psychological counselling with a graduated and closely monitored return to the community.”


	
	Another matter referred to in the pre-sentence report was the applicant’s relationship with the victim. The author reported that the applicant was aware that his previous partner had established another relationship whilst he was on remand but did not envisage any “further difficulties resulting from this” (PSR 2). The author stated that the victim remains supportive of the applicant. Whilst she was not prepared to place her child at risk of harm, the victim indicated to the applicant “that she will consider slowly reconnecting with him upon his return to the community” (PSR 2).
	
	
	The applicant has an extensive criminal record both in New South Wales and Queensland. The record dates from 1980. There are a number of offences of violence including assault and armed robbery. Furthermore, there are offences of dishonesty and drug offences.
	
	
	Included in the applicant’s criminal history is an offence of ‘Aggravated Break and Enter and Commit Felony – In Company’ for which he was sentenced in the District Court at Sydney on 16 February 2001 to a term of imprisonment of 4 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years. He was released to parole in January 2003, but breach action was initiated in November 2003 as the applicant had been convicted in October 2003 for an offence of ‘Goods in personal custody suspected being stolen’. However, the applicant went to Queensland to avoid apprehension. At the time of the commission of the present offence, the applicant was on bail for a number of offences in Queensland.
	


Some findings by the sentencing judge


	
	The sentencing judge observed that there was nothing in the recorded conversations in which the applicant expressed any hesitation about his intention or reluctance to meet with ‘B’. His Honour, later, in his sentencing remarks, said that there was no evidence of an emotional state or mental disturbance when speaking with ‘B’ that was observable on viewing the in-car video. His Honour remarked that “the applicant appeared calm and relaxed bearing in mind that he believed he was dealing with a professional killer” (ROS 10).
	
	
	The sentencing judge found that the offence could not be explained by the applicant’s mental state “but rather by his desire to have the victim out of the way to enable him to have custody of his son” (ROS 10). Little weight could be attached to the evidence of the applicant’s emotional state so as to reduce his culpability.
	
	
	His Honour considered that the applicant’s culpability was not diminished by ‘B’s’ persistence. He noted that the applicant was sufficiently prepared to provide himself with an alibi for the murder by telling ‘B’ he wanted it done when he was in Queensland reporting to police in compliance with his bail conditions.
	
	
	The sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness of the offence to fall within the mid-range for an offence of this nature. His Honour observed that the applicant’s prior criminal history did not make the offence more serious but deprived him of any entitlement to leniency. He noted that issues of personal and general deterrence were of importance when determining the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	His Honour was of the view that the ordinary statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of sentence would be sufficient to address the applicant’s substance abuse and reintegration into the community. His Honour declined to find special circumstances.
	


Additional Evidence


	
	This Court received additional evidence, including affidavits sworn by the applicant, which are directed at the applicant’s conduct while in custody.
	
	
	In an affidavit sworn 24 September 2013, the applicant states that he has completed drug rehabilitation programs including ‘Getting Smart’ and a methadone program. He attends Narcotics Anonymous. The applicant states that he had completed a ‘Managing Emotions’ program and gained a C1 security classification. At Junee Correctional Centre, he participated in a mentoring course where he mentored other inmates, helping them to read, write and complete forms. The applicant says that he hopes to receive work release and would like to complete a cookery course at TAFE.
	
	
	In an affidavit sworn 11 October 2013, the applicant describes having been seriously assaulted by three inmates in his cell at Dawn De Loas Correctional Centre in September 2013 and the psychological impact that the assault has had on him.
	
	
	In an affidavit sworn 15 September 2015, the applicant states that he graduated from the Ngara Nura program, an intensive pre-release drug and alcohol program for inmates, in August 2015 but has continued to participate as a group mentor for other inmates undertaking the program. As part of the program, he was regularly drug tested and returned clean samples on each occasion. His intention is to take part in the program’s community-based group when released to parole.
	
	
	Due to progress in rehabilitation, the applicant’s security classification has been reduced from C1 to C2. Since relocating to Metropolitan Special Programs Centre, he has seen a psychologist and has continued on with his prescribed medicine, which he understands is to treat his depression and to stabilise his mood.
	
	
	The applicant refers to the assault in September 2013 and his continuing vivid dreams about the assault and feeling fearful of other inmates.
	
	
	The applicant has spoken to a Commissioner from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse about his experiences of having been sexually assaulted by a staff member at Minda Detention Centre. The Royal Commission has offered him further counselling which he had not taken up as he was receiving support from the psychologist and others in the Ngara Nura program.
	
	
	The applicant recounts that the victim visits him in custody and they also maintain telephone contact. A good relationship is maintained for the sake of their son who is almost 11 years old. The victim has told him that upon his release, she will help him set up a place to live nearby where she lives so that they can care for their son together.
	


Submissions on re-sentence


	
	The sentencing judge’s characterisation of the offence as falling within the middle range of seriousness was criticised by the applicant. The applicant argues that the sentencing judge has erroneously taken into account the formation of the intent to kill and the communication of that intent to another as aggravating the objective seriousness of the offending, whereas these are necessary elements of the offence of solicit to murder. Other matters such as speaking to Mr X over a period of 10 days, travelling from Queensland to Wyong to meet him, and the applicant’s response that he wanted his wife put in “a cemetery”, were said to go to the commission of the offence, but did not make it objectively more serious.
	
	
	The applicant referred to what were said to be comparative cases and in particular to Louizos v R [2014] NSWCCA 242 (Louizos [No 2]) which this Court was informed was the only s 26 offence to have been considered on appeal since the decision in Kentwell. The applicant pointed out that unlike Louizos [No 2], there was no actual harm to the victim, no custody proceedings were on foot, no money changed hands and no other actual offenders were brought into the commission of the offence.
	
	
	Reference was also made to the Judicial Commission sentencing statistics which disclose that the total sentence imposed on 12 offenders for a s 26 offence between October 2007 and September 2014 ranged from 4 to 14 years, and the non-parole periods ranged from 2 to 10 years.
	
	
	It was submitted that there were two offenders who received the highest total sentence of 14 years (rounded up), one of whom was the applicant, but he was the only offender who received the highest non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	As to his subjective circumstances, the applicant made particular reference to the continuing support of the victim and his participation in the Ngura Nara program whilst serving his sentence.
	
	
	Whilst the Crown accepts that the formation of an intention to kill an intended victim and the communication of that intention to another are necessary elements of an offence of solicit to murder, the Crown submits that does not preclude, when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, regard being had to how long the relevant intention to kill existed and also to the level and degree of planning and organisation involved in the offence. The Crown refers to the applicant being on conditional liberty at the time of the offence and that he had not demonstrated any contrition or remorse.
	
	
	Another submission is that this Court would conclude that the applicant’s prior criminal history demonstrates a “continuing attitude of disobedience of the law” and consequently retribution, deterrence and protection of society all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted.
	
	
	The Crown argues that although the applicant has taken some positive steps to address his drug problems, particularly in the Ngara Nura program, his extensive prior criminal history, which has seen him on a number of occasions return to drug use upon release on parole, makes it difficult for this Court to make any positive findings with respect to the risk of re-offending and his prospects of rehabilitation.
	


Re-Sentence?


	
	There was some discussion during oral argument as to whether this Court is permitted to make its own assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence where the sentencing judge’s assessment had not been challenged by a separate ground of appeal. Written submissions on this issue from the parties were subsequently received.
	
	
	In my view, specific error having been identified, it is necessary for this Court to re-exercise the sentencing discretion as required by Kentwell, which includes an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	It is unsurprising, however, that the sentencing judge’s assessment that this was a mid-range offence of solicit to murder was not challenged in the first appeal. I find myself in agreement with his Honour’s characterisation of the offence. The objective gravity of the applicant’s offending is particularly serious. The offence was motivated by his selfish desire to obtain custody of his son. To achieve this end, the applicant was prepared to have the mother of their two year old child murdered. It is difficult to conceive a more serious offence of a domestic nature other than murder itself.
	
	
	An aggravating factor is that the offence was planned. The applicant provided to ‘B’ a photograph of the intended victim, a description of her motor vehicle and registration number, directions to her current address and told ‘B’ that he would create an alibi for himself by reporting to the police in Queensland at the time she was killed. He had the opportunity to reconsider his position during the various meetings with Mr X and ‘B’ but did not resile from his intention to harm the victim. Johnson J in the first appeal appositely observed at [62]:
	


“This was a chilling offence, motivated by self-interest, by which the Applicant intended the murder of this very young woman, who had done no harm to the Applicant. All she had done was refuse to return to Queensland to live with the Applicant, her fugitive partner.”


	
	The sentencing judge, in my opinion, correctly found that the applicant’s culpability was in no way diminished by the fact that ‘B’ was an undercover police officer. As his Honour said (ROS 13):
	


“So far as it may be submitted that the offender’s culpability is diminished by the persistence or incitement by the undercover operative such that the offence may not have been committed in the absence of such persistence it must be borne in mind that the offender wished to engage a hit man prior to the undercover operative contacting him. There was nothing in their conversations demonstrating a reluctance or a desire to withdraw but rather a determination to see the enterprise through.”


	
	The lack of harm to the intended victim does not mitigate the offence. I agree with Johnson J when he said in the first appeal at [64]:
	


“I reject the Applicant's submission that it can mitigate penalty that the victim was not harmed. The offence is complete when the elements of solicit to murder are established. The crime consists of an intent and a request: Bou-Antoun v R  [2008] NSWCCA 1 at [40]. Had there been physical harm inflicted upon the victim, then some other offence would likely be committed.”


	
	Another aggravating factor to be taken into account on sentence is that the offence was committed whilst the applicant was on bail. The commission of an offence whilst on conditional liberty has long been recognised as a factor of aggravation requiring the passing of deterrent sentences for those who abuse their freedom on bail: R v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at [40]-[42]; In the Matter of the Attorney General's Application (No 1) under s26 of the Criminal Appeal Act; R v Ponfield; R v Scott; R v Ryan; R v Johnson [1999] NSWCCA 435 at [48]; 48 NSWLR 327 at 337.
	
	
	The applicant’s criminal antecedents do not entitle him to leniency. An unattractive feature of the offence was that it was committed whilst he was in breach of parole and was effectively a fugitive from justice. His prior record discloses that more weight is to be given to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of the community than would otherwise be the case: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242 at [62]; 66 NSWLR 566 at 578; R v M.A.K., R v M.S.K. [2006] NSWCCA 381 at [51]; Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14 at [14]; 164 CLR 465 at 477.
	
	
	Personal and general deterrence are important considerations in the sentencing exercise for the reasons previously given and as the offence of soliciting a person to murder another is a heinous crime. I agree with Johnson J’s observation in the first appeal at [73]:
	


“Deterrence has a particular relevance when, as here, the Applicant's intended use of a professional killer would reduce the chance of detection, because the Applicant would be able to place himself at some distance from the killing (see [39] above): R v Potier at [56].”


	
	In my mind, there is another reason that general deterrence has significance in the present case. All too often partners in a domestic relationship resort to violence. The community cannot tolerate violence in any domestic setting, but the community’s abhorrence of a crime intended to secure the custody of a young child by the murder of the mother needs to be expressed in the sentence to deter persons who might be like-minded to commit such a crime.
	
	
	Some emphasis was placed by the applicant on the continuing support of the victim, notwithstanding the fact that she has entered into a new relationship. According to the applicant, the victim has told him that upon his release, she will help him set up a place to live nearby where she lives so that they can care for their son together. However, the victim’s attitude does little to assist him. The forgiveness of the victim cannot be allowed to interfere with a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion for the reason that a serious crime is a wrong committed against the community at large and the community is itself entitled to retribution. One of the purposes of punishment is to protect the public, not mollify the victim: R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381 at [37]; 134 A Crim R 174 at 183-184; R v Burton [2008] NSWCCA 128 at [102]; Efthimiadis at [67].
	
	
	Turning to the prospects of rehabilitation, the applicant’s participation in the ‘Getting Smart’ and Ngara Nura program indicates that he is taking steps to overcome his long-standing drug abuse. Although this encourages an optimistic view to be taken about his future, it must be remembered that he has not successfully completed any of the five parole orders previously imposed, relapsing to drug use, re-offending and on the last occasion moving interstate without permission. Another matter that militates against a positive finding is that at no stage has he expressed remorse for his offending behaviour. He has not taken responsibility for what he has done, notwithstanding the goodwill exhibited by the victim towards him. This Court has observed that there can be rehabilitation without confession, but evidence of genuine remorse and insight into the offending conduct remain powerful factors supporting a finding of good prospects of rehabilitation and the unlikelihood of re-offending: Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 35 at [47]. When all these matters are weighed in combination, I am unable to conclude on the balance of probabilities that the applicant has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	It is true, as the applicant submits, that the Judicial Commission sentencing statistics reveal that the applicant is one of two offenders who received the highest sentence of 14 years imprisonment and the applicant is the only offender who has been sentenced to a non-parole period of 10 years for an offence of solicit to murder. Sentencing statistics “have a role to play in fostering consistency in sentencing, and in appellate review, provided care is taken to understand the basis upon which they have been compiled”: R v Pham [2015] HCA 39 at [49] per Bell and Gageler JJ. However, the limited use that may be made of these statistics is well known. In Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520, the High Court stated at [54]:
	


“…a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits.”


	
	The statistics do not disclose anything about why the sentences were passed, particularly the objective seriousness of the offending and the subjective features of the offender. Sentences imposed in other cases “do not mark the outer bounds of the permissible sentencing discretion. They stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence”: MLP v R [2014] NSWCCA 183 at [42]; Barbaro v R; Zirilli v R [2014] HCA 2; 253 CLR 58; Skocic v R [2014] NSWCCA 225.
	
	
	Any benefit that can be attached to the statistics is diminished for a s 26 offence as the sample group is small, being confined to 12 non-consecutive sentences imposed between October 2007 and September 2014.
	
	
	In Pham, Bell and Gageler JJ observed at [49]:
	


“The value of sentencing statistics will vary between offences. It is not meaningful to speak of a pattern of past sentences in the case of offences which are not frequently prosecuted and where a relatively small number of sentences make up the set.”


	
	The Court was referred to a number of cases but particular emphasis was placed by the applicant on the decision of this Court in Louizos [No 2]. Shortly stated, the facts of this case are that the offender and the victim (her former husband) had three children from their marriage. There were protracted but not finalised proceedings in the Family Court. An interim order had been made for the children to reside with the offender, with regular access visits to the victim; however, the oldest child lived with him. The offender organised with one of her employees to kill the victim. The employee then organised for two others to assist him. The offender paid the three men and showed them where the victim lived. They subsequently drove to the victim’s house early in the morning and stabbed him nine times, disembowelling him and leaving him for dead. The victim suffered very serious injuries and had continuing health problems at the time of sentence. The offender was convicted after trial of soliciting to murder the victim contrary to s 26 of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	At first instance, the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years. The Crown successfully appealed (pre-Muldrock) and the sentence was increased to 13 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 10 years: Louizos v R, R v Louizos [2009] NSWCCA 71. In Louizos [No 2], this Court reconsidered the Crown appeal and imposed a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years.
	
	
	The applicant sought to draw some comfort from the sentence imposed in Louizos [No 2], arguing that the offending was more serious than in the present case. As may be expected, there are material differences in the circumstances of offending, and the subjective circumstances of each offender. Although the victim in Louizos [No 2] was seriously injured, I have previously found that a lack of harm to an intended victim does not mitigate a s 26 offence (see [81] above). A real point of difference was that Ms Louizos had no prior offences and relatively modest weight was afforded to her prior good character whereas the applicant committed the offence whilst on conditional liberty, was in breach of parole and had an extensive prior criminal history.
	
	
	Whilst Louizos [No 2] and the other cases provide some assistance, it is a matter for this Court to make its own independent assessment, bearing in mind the legislative guideposts of the maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period of 10 years, the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective features of the offender.
	
	
	I do not consider that special circumstances exist which greatly justify the balance of the term of the sentence exceeding one-third of the non-parole period. The balance of term of 3 years 4 months is a sufficient period under supervision to enable the applicant to adjust to community life and to address his substance abuse.
	
	
	Taking into account all relevant matters, I conclude that no lesser sentence should have been passed.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	



	
	An extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	HARRISON J: I agree with Price J.
	
	
	100 BUTTON J: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of Price J. I gratefully adopt his Honour’s comprehensive summary of all of the salient features of this matter.
	
	
	10I respectfully agree with the analysis of his Honour of the question of whether leave should be granted to bring a further appeal to this Court. I also agree with the analysis of his Honour of the question of whether the remarks on sentence of 2010 reveal a “Muldrock error”, and of the need for re-sentence.
	
	
	Exercising the sentencing discretion afresh, however, I have respectfully come to a different view to that of his Honour.
	
	
	It is certainly true that this was a grave example of an inherently grave offence; that the offence is completed whether or not there has been harm to the victim; that the fact that the applicant was on at least two forms of conditional liberty at the time of its commission is a serious aggravating feature; that his criminal record does not assist him; that he has previously not completed a number of parole orders, relapsing to drug use and re-offending; and that, despite the passage of many years, the applicant has never demonstrated remorse.
	
	
	To be weighed against those factors is the fact that the applicant seems to have used his many years in custody reasonably constructively, and has taken steps to address his long-standing drug abuse; and that, despite everything, he enjoys the support of the victim of the offence (a matter that may weigh in favour of his rehabilitation).
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, putting the sentence originally imposed from my mind, I would re-sentence by way of a head sentence of imprisonment of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years.
	
	
	Because I understand that I am in the minority with regard to this question, I shall not tarry to detail the formal orders that I would propose in order to achieve that result.
	
	
	Of course, I have not come to the view that the approach to re-sentence of the majority is wrong. Rather, the divergence between us is merely a function of the fact that the adoption of an instinctive synthesis can sometimes lead to differing responses to a question to which there is no single “right” answer.
