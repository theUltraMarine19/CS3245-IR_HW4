     FLEMING, David Graham v R 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted following a trial of the murder of Johanne Hatty. Ms Hatty was murdered in the early hours of 18 February 1984 at Spains Lookout, Neutral Bay. Her body was discovered on a rock ledge on the harbour side of the lookout. She had been strangled with some type of ligature. Her clothes were dishevelled. Her belongings including her handbag and umbrella had been placed on the ledge bedside her. 
     
      
    2 At the time the appellant was living in a boarding house about 700 metres from the lookout. He had recently moved to Sydney. He was considered to be a suspect by the police and although questioned was not charged. 
     
      
    3 The crime scene investigation and the post-mortem examination indicated that the deceased had been sexually assaulted, most probably after she had died. Forensic samples were taken from her body and tested to the limited extent available in 1984. Semen was identified in a swab taken from her vagina. The analysts were unable to take a blood grouping from the semen sample. DNA testing was not yet available. DNA testing was ultimately carried out in 1989 but this was unsuccessful due to the fact that large amounts of a sample were necessary in order to obtain a profile at that time. 
     
      
    4 In 2004 the police decided to reopen the investigation. This decision was taken because of the advances which had by this time been made in DNA technology. The samples which were taken from the deceased were retested resulting in a partial male DNA profile being obtained. An investigation was launched.  
     
      
    5 By this time the appellant was living in rural Victoria. There was another person who was also suspected but after his DNA was analysed he was eliminated as a suspect. 
     
      
    6 The police ascertained that the appellant was not recorded on any DNA database in Australia. There was no Victorian or interstate legislation in place pursuant to which a court order could have been sought to take a DNA sample from the appellant while he was in Victoria. The Victorian Government Solicitor had given advice to the Victorian police that the taking of covert DNA samples although not unlawful, may be regarded by a court as improper leading to its exclusion if sought to be tendered by the prosecution. 
     
      
    7 The NSW police had discussions with the Victorian police about the possible surveillance of the appellant. However, he was living in a remote location and it was decided that surveillance was almost impossible. The assistance of the Victorian police was sought so that other investigative methods could be implemented. 
     
      
    8 Sergeant Vick of the Victorian police knew the appellant and had had a number of conversations with him 12 months earlier when there was a complaint about a drover and alleged rudeness to the appellant by police. Sergeant Vick visited the appellant at home and asked him to draw a sketch indicating the location of the drover 12 months earlier. The appellant cooperated. Spittle was observed to fall onto the paper. The sketch was sent to the NSW police where a DNA profile was recovered. That profile matched a partial DNA profile recovered from the vaginal swabs of the deceased. The partial profile could be expected to occur in 1 in 52,000 people in the general population. 
     
      
    9 After the sheet of paper had been analysed the police obtained a warrant for the appellant’s arrest. This occurred and he was extradited to NSW. A further forensic procedure was carried out by the police. A DNA profile developed from a buccal swab of the appellant matched the DNA profile from the vaginal swab, yielding a possibility of 1 in 8.6 billion individuals sharing the same DNA profile. 
     
      
    10 Detective Sergeant Bryant of the NSW police was responsible for the investigation. He was aware that there was no legislation in Victoria which allowed an application to be made to authorise obtaining a DNA profile where the investigation was into the commission of an offence outside of Victoria. Detective Sergeant Bryant considered the appellant to be a flight risk who might react to a renewed police interest in him. In December 2004 Detective Sergeant Bryant was aware that there was an outstanding warrant for the appellant. The warrant had issued after the appellant had failed to appear at court in relation to an offence charged in NSW in 1984 of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. It would have been possible to have the appellant arrested on that warrant and then returned to NSW where the procedures provided by the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000 for the taking of a sample by a buccal swab could have been implemented. Detective Sergeant Bryant gave evidence that he did not seek to have the appellant arrested in Victoria for his failure to appear some 20 years previously because he did not think of it. The trial judge accepted his evidence. 
     
      
    11 A voir dire was conducted as to the admissibility of the DNA evidence. The trial judge concluded that it should be admitted. The appellant was subsequently convicted. The appellant has challenged the decision to admit the DNA evidence and raised further grounds of appeal against his conviction. There is no appeal against sentence. The grounds of appeal are: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The learned trial judge erred in admitting into the evidence the DNA profile of the appellant 
       
       
      Ground 2: The learned trial judge erred in not warning the jury as regards lies of an accused in the context of alibi evidence 
       
       
      Ground 3: The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury as to the approach to the DNA profiling evidence 
       
       
      Ground 4: The learned trail judge erred in not giving a direction similar to those in  
      Longmore  
      and 
       Crampton 
       
       
      Ground 5: The verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported or there was a miscarriage of justice 
       
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    12 Section 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 provides a power for a court to exclude evidence that was obtained improperly or in contravention of an Australian law. Section 138 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Evidence that was obtained:  
         
          
          (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or 
           
          (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, 
          
         
         
          
          is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. 
          
         
         
        (2) Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning:  
         
         
          
          (a) did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission. 
          
         
         
        (3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:  
         
         
          
          (a) the probative value of the evidence, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and 
          
         
         
          
          (c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and 
          
         
         
        (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and 
         
         
          
          (e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and 
          
         
         
          
          (f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the  
          International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
          , and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and 
          
         
         
          
          (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law. 
          
         
         
        Note. 
         The  
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
         is set out in Schedule 2 to the  
        Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 
         1986 of the Commonwealth.” 
        
       
      
    13 The trial judge concluded that the evidence of the appellant’s DNA was not obtained in contravention of an Australian law or as a consequence of any such contravention. His Honour accepted that the appellant was tricked into cooperating with Sergeant Vick but held that the police conduct was not improper within the meaning of s 138. His Honour also determined that if he had found a relevant impropriety the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting it (s 138(3)). His Honour concluded that the DNA evidence was highly probative and there being no deliberate attempt to avoid the provisions of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act (NSW) or any other statute the evidence should be admitted. 
     
      
    14 The appellant did not submit that the evidence was obtained in contravention of an Australian law or as a consequence of any such contravention. However, it was submitted that it was obtained improperly. Because the 1984 warrant had not lapsed it was submitted that the proper course was for the appellant to have been arrested pursuant to that warrant and extradited to NSW. It was submitted that the appellant was tricked into providing his DNA and for that reason there was an impropriety which should have led to the evidence being rejected. 
     
      
    15 The appellant drew attention to some consideration in the authorities of the admissibility of confessions obtained by trick, in particular the judgments of Kirby J in Swaffield and Pavic v The Queen (1998) 192 CLR 159 and Tofilau v The Queen; Marks v The Queen; Hill v The Queen; Clark v The Queen (2007) HCA 39; 231 CLR 396. 
     
      
    16 It was further submitted that once it was accepted that the initial DNA evidence had been obtained by an impropriety, and because that led to the appellant’s arrest, the evidence from the DNA which was obtained once the appellant had returned to NSW should also have been excluded. It was submitted that the latter evidence was the “fruit of the initial impropriety” and should not have been admitted into evidence. 
     
      
    17 Impropriety is not defined in the Evidence Act. In Ridgway v The Queen (1984) 184 CLR 19, a case before the Evidence Act was enacted, Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ said, at 37, that “the stage of impropriety will be reached in the case of conduct which is not illegal only in cases involving a degree of harassment or manipulation which is clearly inconsistent with minimum standards of acceptable police conduct in all the circumstances.” Their Honours acknowledged that the effective investigation by police may involve subterfuge and deceit and may extend to the intentional creation of opportunities for the commission by a suspect of a criminal offence. Their Honours acknowledged that “a finding that law enforcement officers have engaged in … clearly improper conduct will not, of course, suffice of itself to give rise to the discretion to exclude evidence of the alleged offences or of an element of it.” Their Honours accepted that deceptive tactics, which do not involve illegal conduct, will ordinarily be legitimate. 
     
      
    18 The meaning of the term “impropriety” was considered by this Court in Robinson v Woolworths Limited [2005] NSWCCA 426; 64 NSWLR 612. The court held that the principles collected in Ridgeway should be applied to s 138 when considering whether particular events constitute an impropriety. Basten JA said at [21]: 
     
      
       
        
        Relevance of general law principles 
         
         
        21 Section 138 has a broad scope. For example, it applies not merely to evidence obtained unlawfully, but also evidence obtained “improperly”. It applies not only in criminal proceedings, but also in civil proceedings. It applies to all kinds of evidence, including admissions which, for the purposes of criminal proceedings, may also need to be considered under ss 84, 85 and 90. Finally, and significantly for the present case, the section covers, not merely impropriety or unlawful conduct in the acquisition of evidence following an offence, but also conduct which constitutes the offence.  
         
         
        22 It is clear that s 138 varies the common law in a number of respects: see Anderson, Hunter and Williams  
        The New Evidence Law: Annotations and Commentary on the Uniform Evidence Acts 
         (2002), p 510. Nevertheless, s 9 of the Act states:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          9(1) This Act does not affect the operation of a principle or rule of common law or equity in relation to evidence in a proceeding to which this Act applies, except so far as this Act provides otherwise expressly or by necessary intendment. 
           
          Thus, in relation to s 138, there is no doubt that the statutory rule involves exclusion of evidence, where its terms are engaged, subject to a discretion to admit. The general law rule was framed in terms of a discretion to exclude. Secondly, s 138 is not in terms limited to unlawful or improper conduct on the part of law enforcement authorities. Each of these considerations may be relevant in determining what constitutes “impropriety” for the purposes of s 138 and invite caution in considering whether to apply general law principles without qualification. On the other hand, because the Act does not define the concept of impropriety, it is difficult to perceive any necessary intention on the part of the legislature to vary the principles collected in  
          Ridgeway 
          , derived from earlier Australian authority. Accordingly, those principles should be applied. 
          
         
         
        23 It follows that the identification of impropriety requires attention to the following propositions. First, it is necessary to identify what, in a particular context, may be viewed as “the minimum standards which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement”. Secondly, the conduct in question must not merely blur or contravene those standards in some minor respect; it must be “quite inconsistent with” or “clearly inconsistent with” those standards. Thirdly, the concepts of “harassment” and “manipulation” suggest some level of encouragement, persuasion or importunity in relation to the commission of an offence: thus, in describing the first category of cases (at 39) the joint judgment in  
        Ridgeway  
        referred to offences being procured or induced.” 
        
       
      
    19 In the present case there was no unlawfulness in the conduct of the police officer. His Honour accepted, in my view correctly, that it was for the accused to establish impropriety: R v Coulstock (1998) 99 A Crim R 143 to 147. The trial judge accepted that the appellant was tricked into cooperating with Sergeant Vick but was not persuaded that the line which would make the sergeant’s conduct improper was crossed. 
     
      
    20 The appellant relied significantly in his written submissions on the judgment of Kirby J in Tofilau. However, it is important to recognise that his Honour was in dissent in that case. Furthermore the principles discussed by Kirby J relate to deception in obtaining a confession, an issue of a different character to obtaining a suspect’s DNA sample.  
     
      
    21 The considerations relevant to the exercise of discretion pursuant to s 138 were discussed by this Court in R v Camilleri [2007] NSWCCA 36; 169 A Crim R 197 at [31]: 
     
      
       
        
        “As Howie J made plain in  
        R v EM  
        (2003) NSWCCA 374 at [74]-[78] s 138 is concerned with balancing public interests. The prejudice to the individual accused, which to varying degrees must be present in every case, will rarely be material. It may be of concern if the means by which the evidence was obtained has the consequence that an accused cannot effectively respond to it. There may be other personal considerations in a particular case. However, the fundamental concern of the section is to ensure that, if the law has been breached, or some other impropriety has been involved in obtaining the evidence, this is balanced against the public interest in successfully prosecuting alleged offenders. The competing interests are obedience to the law in the gathering of evidence and enforcement of the law in respect of offenders.” 
        
       
      
    22 The decision which the trial judge was required to make was discretionary and must be reviewed in accordance with the principles in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. There is no suggestion that his Honour made any error of fact or law, had regard to any irrelevant matter or failed to consider a relevant matter. The conclusion which his Honour reached was clearly open to him. This ground of appeal fails.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: the learned trial judge erred in not warning the jury as regards lies of an accused in the context of alibi evidence 
       
      
    23 The appellant gave evidence at his trial. In part he sought to raise an alibi. He said that at the relevant time he had travelled to North Queensland to visit the mother of his child, who he believed had been involved in an accident. He dated this event by reference to his appearance at Fairfield court which he said occurred on 14 February 1984. However, the court records indicated that he was not due in court until 22 March of that year, with his first court appearance being 28 March, and the matter being finally disposed of on 26 May 1984. 
     
      
    24 It was submitted that, although the prosecution did not rely upon the appellant’s apparent lie as to his whereabouts as evidence of consciousness of guilt, the trial judge ought to have given directions in relation to lies and a false alibi. Support was sought from the decision of the High Court in Zoneff v The Queen [2000] HCA 28; (2000) 200 CLR 234. I infer that the appellant submitted that the direction referred to in [23] of Zoneff may have been appropriate. That direction was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “You have heard a lot of questions, which attribute lies to the accused. You will make up your own mind about whether he was telling lies and if he was, whether he was doing so deliberately. It is for you to decide what significance those suggested lies have in relation to the issues in the case but I give you this warning: do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something, that is evidence of guilt.” 
        
       
      
    25 When directing the jury his Honour was careful to provide the jury with assistance in consideration of the appellant’s evidence. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Bearing this in mind, though: That by giving evidence, the accused has not assumed the burden of proving anything. He has told you in the course of his evidence that he did not attack the deceased. He does not have to prove that assertion; rather, it is for the Crown to prove that the accused caused the death of the deceased. Obviously if you accept the evidence that the accused has given as being reliable evidence on that issue, you would find the accused not guilty. If you do not accept the evidence that the accused has given on that matter, it does not automatically follow that you would find the accused guilty. You must determine whether, on the evidence which you accept in this case, the Crown has satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    26 His Honour further directed the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “But suppose you conclude his evidence is unreliable in asserting that he set off for Queensland on 15 February 1984 as those court records would indicate, and that there is no explanation that you accept from the accused as to his movements around the time that the deceased died, it is nevertheless important that you fully appreciate and make due allowance for the difficulties faced by the accused in attempting to remember and to show now where he was at a particular time in February of 1984. He does not have to prove he was out of Sydney on 18 February 1984. Rather, the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt all the ingredients of the crime charged, and that includes, of course, proving the presence of the accused at Spains Lookout when the deceased was strangled, if you find that is what occurred.” 
        
       
      
    27 The trial judge also directed the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “All together, the Crown submits you would reject the evidence of the accused. But going back to the case presented by the Crown, and the Crown very properly reminded you as I have done and I do again here remind you that it is not for the accused to prove anything to you. The Crown has to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    28 Complaint was also made by the appellant that when opening to the jury the prosecutor indicated that the Crown proposed to call evidence that “when the (appellant) spoke to Inspector O’Toole, at that time it was Sergeant O’Toole, he told him that he had been living at the premises in 2004 (sic – 1984) and on the night of this murder he had been home in bed.” The import was that the appellant had told lies about his whereabouts at the relevant time. Subsequently the trial judge ruled that this evidence was inadmissible and no further mention was made of it. 
     
      
    29 The trial judge made clear to the jury that the Crown Prosecutor’s opening was only the evidence that he anticipated would be called. He emphasised that what counsel had said is not evidence. His Honour told the jury that the case must be decided on the evidence tendered before them. The Crown Prosecutor confirmed the position, saying that his opening was not evidence and that “everything that I have said to you is not evidence. Again I remind you of what his Honour said, that you must decide this case on the evidence.” 
     
      
    30 Nothing was said by the High Court in Zoneff which requires a particular form of words to be used by the trial judge when a question of alibi is raised. A criticism of the directions in Zoneff was that the trial judge had raised the possibility that the telling of lies by the accused indicated a consciousness of guilt but provided little further guidance. The High Court said the matter was “then left … largely up in the air” (at [22]). It was in that context that the High Court made a suggestion with respect to the appropriate direction. 
     
      
    31 In my opinion the directions which his Honour gave in relation to the appellant’s evidence were appropriate. It would have been obvious to the jury, as the appellant conceded, that the prosecutor was not relying on particular lies to prove the appellant’s guilt. I am satisfied that the jury were appropriately instructed that they could not use the rejection of the appellant’s alibi evidence to reason towards his guilt of the offence with which he was charged. 
     
      
    32 I reject ground 2. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: the learned trial judge erred in directing the jury as to the approach to the DNA profiling evidence 
       
      
    33 The appellant put in issue at his trial the integrity of the collection and handling of DNA samples. As was recognised by the trial judge in his summing up the Crown case was dependent upon the jury accepting the DNA evidence. His Honour explained to the jury that the Crown case was that the DNA profile from the appellant taken from the sketch collected by Sergeant Vick matched the appellant’s buccal swab and was the same as the DNA profile of the person whose DNA was found on testing a swab taken from the deceased’s vagina. The evidence from Ms Sharon Neville, senior forensic biologist with the Division of Analytical Laboratories indicated that the probability of someone else sharing the same profile as that of the appellant was 1 in 8.6 billion individuals. 
     
      
    34 The post-mortem of the deceased was carried out by Dr Wong who took three swabs being from the vagina, rectum and an oral swab. After taking the swabs he placed a smear from each of them on a glass slide which he marked 2b, 3b and 4b respectively. The original swabs were marked 2a, 3a and 4a. Those swabs were placed in a transport medium which rendered blood testing impossible. The swabs and slides were delivered to Dr Baxter on 20 February 1984 but because of the inappropriate transport medium Dr Baxter requested that fresh swabs be taken. The evidence was that Dr Wong obtained further swabs identified as 2a(ii) (vaginal); 3a(ii) (rectal); and 4a(ii) (oral). 
     
      
    35 On 21 February 1984 Dr Baxter reported the presence of semen on swab 2a(ii) and smear 2b but he was unable to carry out blood testing. Swabs 2a and 2a(ii) were retested in 2004. 
     
      
    36 The appellant accepts that swab 2a was a swab taken from the vagina of the deceased by Dr Wong. Ms Neville concluded, following analysis of the partial DNA profile on that swab, that she would expect the profile to occur in approximately 1 in 52,000 individuals. 
     
      
    37 In relation to swab 2a(ii) there was no written record as to how it came into existence. Dr Baxter gave evidence that he had sought fresh samples after receiving the original ones from Dr Wong. Dr Wong said that he could not remember taking the second swab. However, there is convincing evidence that he did so. Dr Wong recognised that he had written the label on the swab 2a(ii). He had misspelled the word vagina as “vargina” both on the label dated 18 February 1984, being swab 2a, and on the label dated 20 February 1984 swab 2a(ii). He said that he had misspelled that word in a similar fashion in the past.  
     
      
    38 This analysis of the relevant evidence is consistent with the approach of defence counsel at the trial. In his address to the jury defence counsel made no submission to the effect that Dr Wong had not taken the swab and addressed no submissions as to its genesis. The trial judge also referred to swab 2a(ii) without any suggestion that its origin was an issue in the proceedings.  
     
      
    39 The chain of possession of swabs 2a and 2a(ii) was a live issue at the trial. There was a break in the documentary records in relation to their storage. The record shows Snr Const Rodney Hunt collected the exhibits from the Division of Forensic Medicine in Glebe on 11 July 1985 signing them to the Sydney Scientific Investigation Section. They were next located at the Chatswood Scientific Investigation Section on 29 June 1989. There was no explanation as to how they moved from Sydney to Chatswood. 
     
      
    40 Snr Constable Hunt gave evidence that although he had no memory of what he did with the exhibits when he signed for them on 11 July 1985, the general practice was that they were taken from the Division of Forensic Medicine to the Scientific section in Sydney and kept in an exhibits room. The assumption was that another officer must have taken them from the exhibits room to Chatswood. 
     
      
    41 This gap in the record became an issue at the trial which was addressed by both counsel and by the trial judge. The defence submission was that the period when the swabs could not be accounted for provided an opportunity for tampering. 
     
      
    42 The Crown responded to this suggestion. It was submitted that it was significant that the appellant’s DNA profile was found on swab 2a(ii) and the partial profile matching that of the appellant was found on swab 2a. There was no third contributor found on either swab taken from the deceased. A partial DNA profile was developed from swab 2a and a full DNA profile developed from swab 2a(ii). The consequence was that if there was contamination or tampering it occurred with respect to not one but both swabs. Although the swab stick on swab 2a had come loose from the swab holder this was not the case with swab 2a(ii).  
     
      
    43 In these circumstances it is understandable that the defence focused upon the possibility of deliberate tampering of swab 2a(ii) by the original investigating officer, Det O’Toole. The defence theory was that Det O’Toole had collected used condoms from the bedroom of the appellant in 1984 and had at some later stage used the semen within those condoms to contaminate swab 2a(ii) by adding the appellant’s DNA to that swab. Det O’Toole was cross-examined to this effect but categorically denied that he had interfered in the manner suggested. Because DNA testing was not available in 1984 there would have been no purpose in Det O’Toole taking this course at that time. 
     
      
    44 Ms Neville gave evidence that it had been possible to develop a complete male profile and a nearly complete female profile from swab 2a(ii). The male DNA recovered matched the DNA profile of the appellant. The single female profile was consistent with having originated from the deceased. 
     
      
    45 The absence of a third person’s profile in the DNA profiles developed from swab 2a(ii) strongly supports Det O’Toole’s denial that he tampered with swab 2a(ii) by contaminating the vaginal swabs with the appellant’s semen. 
     
      
    46 There was significant evidence which suggested that the murderer of the deceased had unprotected sex with her and that his semen was found within her vagina. The deceased’s corduroy jeans and underpants had been removed and then replaced. A tampon which had been used by the deceased was found near her body. Both Dr Baxter and Dr Wong had observed sperm taken from the vaginal swab on 18 February 1984. Dr Wong observed injuries on the deceased’s body that indicated that sexual intercourse had occurred after death. 
     
      
    47 The trial judge carefully directed the jury in relation to the DNA evidence. Given its significance in the trial this was necessary. His Honour told the jury that proof of a match between the DNA profile developed from the swabs and the appellant’s DNA must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. He told the jury that the Crown case was circumstantial with the DNA evidence being at the centre of that case. His Honour reminded the jury of the delay between the offence and the trial and asked them to consider whether the passage of time may have afforded the opportunity for contamination of the exhibits. His Honour stressed that the DNA evidence was not direct evidence of the commission of the crime.  
     
      
    48 His Honour summarised the Crown submissions relating to the DNA evidence. He was also careful to summarise the defence submissions and emphasised that the Crown could not prove where the swabs had been between July 1985 and June 1989. He summarised the evidence of the scientific witnesses and reminded the jury that the appellant blamed Det O’Toole for taking condoms from his room. 
     
      
    49 Immediately after his Honour had summarised the defence submissions he asked counsel whether there was any matter arising. Counsel answered no and no issue was raised in relation to the directions with respect to the DNA.  
     
      
    50 In these circumstances I am satisfied that the trial judge adequately addressed the issues which the jury was required to resolve in relation to the DNA. I reject ground 3. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The learned trail judge erred in not giving a direction similar to those in  
      Longman  
      and 
       Crampton 
       
       
      
    51 Because of the lengthy period between when the deceased was murdered and the appellant’s arrest it was submitted that the trial judge ought to have given a warning to the jury similar to those given in Longman v The Queen [1989] HCA 60; (1989) 168 CLR 79 and Crampton v The Queen [2000] HCA 60; (2000) 206 CLR 161. No application for further directions or redirections to this effect was made by trial counsel.  
     
      
    52 In my judgment this ground of appeal must also be rejected. 
     
      
    53 The trial judge did give the jury directions in relation to the time which had elapsed between when the deceased was killed and the appellant was arrested. The directions were comprehensive and in my opinion adequate in the circumstances. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is another direction I want to give you before we proceed further, and that is as to the lapse of time here and its effect. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, the deceased met her death on 18 February 1984. The accused was arrested on 18 January 2005 and was brought to New South Wales on 19 January 2005, nearly 21 years later. He is accused of a crime that was committed in February 1984. He is called upon to defend himself and to answer to events that occurred now over 23 years ago. Of course, the fact that there is that passage of time until the accused was charged and now until the accused has been brought to trial does not evidence that the accused was wrongly charged 21 years after the death. There is no doubt that the deceased met her death in February 1984, and in February 1984 there was not the techniques to obtain a DNA profile such as had developed by the time Ms Neville conducted her testing of which you have heard evidence in this case. However, it is important, and most important, that you appreciate fully the effect of that passage of time from February 1984 on the ability of the accused to defend himself by testing prosecution evidence or by adducing evidence in his own case to establish his whereabouts and his movements at the critical time. It is not only the accused who was disadvantaged by that effluxion of time. So too, was the Crown in terms of the recollection of witnesses and in tracking the movement of exhibits and so on. The accused has given evidence that he was in Queensland, having gone there to check on the wellbeing of his son and his son’s mother. The accused says that is where he was when the deceased met her death. The difficulties of finding witnesses to give evidence of his movements so long ago would be obvious to you. He did not have family to back him up, he had lost contact with his mother and sister. You have the affidavit evidence of Miss Ceic, evidencing her unsuccessful attempts to track down any witness or bank or car rental record to show the accused was in Queensland at the relevant time. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        When you are considering the evidence of the accused, it is very important that you fully appreciate and allow for his difficulties in seeking to bring forward evidence as to his movements so long ago. He gave as a reason for remembering when it was he went to Queensland to check on his son and his son’s mother that he found out about the car accident in which they had been involved the day after he was at Fairfield Court, and he says he was at Fairfield Court on 14 February 1984. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        But suppose you conclude his evidence is unreliable in asserting that he set off for Queensland on 15 February 1984 as those court records would indicate, and that there is no explanation that you accept from the accused as to his movements around the time that the deceased died, it is nevertheless important that you fully appreciate and make due allowance for the difficulties faced by the accused in attempting to remember and to show now where he was at a particular time in February of 1984. And in this context again I remind you that the accused does not have to prove anything at this trial. He does not have to prove he was out of Sydney on 18 February 1984. Rather, the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt all the ingredients of the crime charged, and that includes, of course, proving the presence of the accused at Spains Lookout when the deceased was strangled, if you find that is what occurred. 
        
       
       
        
        I stress that you give appropriate consideration and weight to the fact that the accused is standing trial now charged with the alleged commission of a crime that occurred in February 1984. And Mr Austin, you will remember, in his submissions, urged upon you that the accused was hindered in challenging evidence in the Crown case by effluxion of time. The effluxion of time has afforded the opportunity for contamination of evidence, the exhibits, by reason of such lapse. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused, it was submitted, was disadvantaged by reason of the time lapse in exploring whether and, if so, how advantage, could be taken, to use that opportunity to contaminate exhibits. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        But it is very important that you weigh up that submission which Mr Austin made to you, and Mr Austin pointed to the lapse of time, the difficulty for the accused to defend himself. He submitted that was of critical importance, having regard to the fact that we have got more than 20 years that have elapsed here. Mr Austin submitted to you that you would find that you had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, having regard to the effluxion of time; having regard to the denial of guilt by the accused and having regard to the opportunity for the swab 2a(ii) to have been contaminated.” 
        
       
      
    54 Although no issue was raised at the trial the appellant submitted that the trial judge ought to have instructed the jury in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       The disadvantage was real and not speculative 
       
       The disadvantage was heightened by the Crown relying on persuasive DNA evidence and 
       
       It would be dangerous to convict the accused when such evidence formed the only basis for the Crown case and could not be adequately tested without at least scrutinising that evidence with great care. 
       
      
    55 It was further submitted that these directions should have been given with the “unmistakable and firm voice” of the trial judge. 
     
      
    56 I am satisfied that the appellant’s submission cannot be accepted. As is plain from the extract from the trial judge’s summing up set out above his Honour did instruct the jury that the appellant was disadvantaged by the lapse of time. That disadvantage was not increased by the Crown relying on DNA evidence and no direction to that effect was required. The appellant’s DNA did not change. The disadvantage to him was created by the development of the relevant technology so that it was now possible to match his DNA profile to the DNA obtained from the deceased. There was nothing which the appellant could have done with respect to the DNA during the period since the deceased died which could have improved his capacity to defend himself at the trial. 
     
      
    57 Although in some circumstances a warning that it may be dangerous to convict an accused may be necessary this Court has indicated that care must be exercised before that formulation is used. In Robinson v R [2006] NSWCCA 192 at [19] Spigelman CJ described it as “a formulation best avoided, save in exceptional circumstances.” When the evidence in relation to an alleged sexual assault is confined to that of a complainant who may have been a young person when the events were said to have occurred the jury must be carefully instructed. However, the present case is of quite a different character. The trial judge did remind the jury of the difficulty which the appellant may have experienced in obtaining evidence which supported his claim to an alibi. However, beyond that matter the delay could not have caused him prejudice and no further warning was required. 
     
      
    58 There are cases where the events which have happened between the time when the offence was committed and when the accused is tried could cause significant prejudice to an accused person and careful directions from the trial judge are required. One illustration is found in the circumstances in R v Slattery [2002] NSWCCA 367 where the relevant weapon and the crime scene were destroyed before the trial. This Court held that in those circumstances the jury must be clearly reminded of the disadvantage occasioned to the accused when considering its verdict. This was not such a case. 
     
      
       
      Rule 4 and grounds 2, 3 and 4 
       
      
    59 As I have indicated no complaint was made about the directions given by the trial judge in relation to the matters raised in grounds 2, 3 and 4 and accordingly leave is required under rule 4. Before leave can be granted the appellant must demonstrate an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or there has been a miscarriage of justice (see Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at [72]; see also R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536). 
     
      
    60 The absence of an objection by trial counsel confirms that in the context of this trial there was no concern as to the adequacy of his Honour’s directions. As I have indicated in my view the approach of trial counsel was correct and I would, insofar as it may have been required, refuse leave in relation to grounds 2, 3 and 4 raised by the appellant. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: The verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported or there was a miscarriage of justice 
       
      
    61 The approach which this Court must adopt when this ground of appeal is raised has been considered on many occasions. I discussed it briefly in Dodds v R (2009) NSWCCA 78 where I said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant submitted that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence:  
        Criminal Appeal Act  
        1912 s 6(1). The correct approach to this question by an appeal court has been considered by the High Court on a number of occasions:  
        M v R  
        (1994) 181 CLR 487;  
        MFA v R  
        (2002) 213 CLR 606 at 614 at 615. I summarised the relevant principles in  
        R v Habib  
        [2005] NSWCCA 223 and discussed them in  
        Kaliyanda v R  
        [2007] NSWCCA 300. The court’s task is to consider whether upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. The joint judgment in  
        MFA  
        offered the following by way of guidance: 
         
         
          
          “The majority in  
          M 
           pointed out that '[i]n most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced'. In such a case of doubt, it is only where the jury's advantage of seeing and hearing the evidence can explain the difference in conclusion about the accused's guilt that the appellate court may decide that no miscarriage of justice has occurred: 
          
         
         
          
          'If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a  
          significant possibility  
          that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence’ [56]. 
           
          
         
        In their conclusion their Honours acknowledge that it is not uncommon for some aspects of the evidence in a trial to be less than wholly satisfactory although juries are usually well able to evaluate conflicts and imperfections of evidence. ""In the end, the appellate court must ask itself whether it considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred authorising and requiring its intervention"" [96]. 
        
       
      
    62 The appellant submitted that by reason of the issues raised in relation to grounds 1, 2 and 3 the Crown case was flawed and the verdict was unreasonable. As I understand the submission it was being suggested that because the DNA evidence should have been rejected (ground 1) together with the difficulties arising from the apparent lack of truthfulness of the appellant, combined with, if admitted, the unreliability of the DNA evidence, the guilty verdict should be set aside. 
     
      
    63 Although the DNA evidence was central to the Crown case there was other circumstantial evidence which, together with the DNA evidence, made the Crown case compelling. The appellant lived 700 metres away from where the deceased’s body was found. As a consequence he had the opportunity to gain knowledge of the locality and of the rock ledge beyond the park fence where the body was left. There was a witness, Ms Caudwell who observed a person standing in the park between 1 and 2 am at about the time the murder took place. Her evidence did not exclude the appellant. At the time the appellant walked with a limp and wore bandages on his knee most of the time. The police took possession of those bandages. The evidence indicated that threads located in the deceased’s ear, hair and in nearby bushes were similar to wrap yarn used in the crepe bandages that the appellant wore on his knee. Although the evidence was that the yarn was of a common type this was nevertheless a coincidence of great significance. 
     
      
    64 Although the defence suggested that the swabs from the deceased may have been contaminated there was no evidence to support the assertion. It would suggest remarkable foresight by a police officer to anticipate the development of effective DNA analysis in future years. Ultimately the DNA evidence was compelling and together with evidence of proximity, opportunity and the presence of the bandage fibres I am satisfied that there was no inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence: Shepherd v R (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 579. 
     
      
    65 In my judgment the appeal should be dismissed.

   JUDGMENT1 On 30 June 2009 the offender pleaded guilty to the following count on an indictment: 
     
      
      On or about 20 August 2008 at Mascot, in the Sate of New South Wales, imported into Australia, a substance, the substance being a border controlled drug, namely Methamphetamine, and the quantity imported being a marketable quantity. 
      
    2 That count was bought pursuant to s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code (Commonwealth).3 The maximum penalty for that offence is one of 25 years imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $550,000 or both.Pleas4 On 29 June 2009 the offender had pleaded guilty to a count of importation of Methylamphetamine, under s 307.4 of the Criminal Code. The Crown did not accept that plea. 5 The plea to the count under s 307.2(1) was indicated prior to a jury being empanelled. Accordingly the utilitarian value of the plea was limited in terms of the saving to the Court and DPP resources, as well as the fact that various police witnesses did not have to be called. Facts6 A statement of agreed facts dated 29 June 2009 was tendered. (Exhibit S1)7 In summary, on Wednesday 20 August 2008 at 7:47am the offender arrived at the Kingsford Smith Airport International Airport, aboard Garuda Airlines flight GA714. He was searched by customs officers who noticed a bulge on the right inside internal breast pocket of his suit jacket. When asked what it was he said, “food”. Then, giving more specific details, he said that the items included were sugar. The customs officers opened the package and found it to obtain a white crystal substance. Weight8 The total weight was 142 grams. Analysis by the Australian Forensic Drug Laboratory revealed a net weight of 113.5 grams of 73.4% pure methamphetamine, giving a total net pure weight of 83.3 grams. The Australian Federal Police asked the offender where he got the package from, to which the offender replied he had gone to Bali and bought the “ice” off two unknown males for 45 million Indonesian Rupiah (approximately $7500). The accused stated the “ice” was for personal use. 9 Dr Jacmon’s updated psychologist’s report of the 10 August 2009 (Exhibit S10) stated that the offender elaborated on that account. He said that he was prepared to share some of the drugs with his friends.Pre-sentence report 10 A pre-sentence report by Marco Battaglia dated 17 March 2009 was tendered (exhibit S2). 11 That report indicated that Mr Saputra had been the subject of two Victorian community based orders in 2002 and 2004. The first order was revoked and finalized by way of a monetary penalty and the second order was breached and the warrant issued for the breach has not been finalised.12 Mr Saputra claimed that the drug found in his possession was for personal use. He claimed that he purchased the illicit substance three days prior to his departure in a nightclub from persons unknown to him. He further claimed that because it was “such a good price” that he purchased a large quantity intending to use it when in Australia. Having heard all the evidence – including the admissions of the offender – the drugs purchased were clearly not only for his own use but also involved a substantial profit motive.Personal circumstances 13 Mr Saputra gave evidence through an interpreter. He has some English capabilities. He confirmed the personal matters set out below.14 Mr Saputra is aged fifty-four. He had a good upbringing and education within a stable family in Indonesia. His father’s death clearly affected him. He is an Australian citizen with Indonesian ethnicity. From 2008 he resided in Jakarta and gave the address of a step-brother in Melbourne. He has had a series of relationships, including a marriage and a ten-year-old son. He has travelled extensively and worked overseas.15 He is not a naïve individual and has considerable work skills.16 He came to Australia in 1987 as a student, completing university studies and ultimately obtaining a diploma in business administration in 1991. He initially worked as a courier and then became self-employed as a proprietor of a furniture importing concern, essentially connecting with a family business base in Indonesia. He said his income was of the order of $80,000-$90,000 gross. 17 His reasons for travelling were due to being involved in the family business in Indonesia.18 Clearly his past relationship difficulties and breakdowns have had a dramatic affect on him, as did the death of his father and his separation from his son. The difficulties led to the resumption of his drug use.19 I have real concerns about the offender’s truthfulness having heard and observed him giving his evidence. I have little confidence in anything he says about his future plans.Psychologist’s Report20 There were 2 reports tendered from Dr John Jacmon, psychologist, dated 6 April 2009 (Exhibit S9) and 10 August 2009. (Exhibit S10)21 Relevantly they set out that his breakdown in various relationships led to his drug usage. He was on a rehabilitation program in 2003 involving counselling. There was a further relationship breakdown in 2005 as a result of which he relapsed into deep depression and drug usage including usage of methamphetamine in Jakarta. He told the psychologist that in Indonesia “ice was much cheaper than in Australia so he bought enough ice in Indonesia for his needs whilst he was in Australia”. The report of 6 April 2009 included that Mr Saputra’s disorders were unlikely to resolve by themselves and he needed extensive and regular treatment to address his symptoms and to ensure that he adopted active drug relapse prevention skills. Any such plan should include the provision of regular urine samples to monitor his progress in remaining drug free.22 The second report of 10 August 2009 referred to the fact that in 2008 at least Mr Saputra was “a seasoned user of ice”.Drug usage23 The offender reported to the author of the pre-sentence report that the drugs found in his possession were for personal use. That statement preceded the plea of guilty on legal advice on 30 June 2009. 24 The offender said that he first briefly experimented with crystal methamphetamine (ice) after the breakdown of his marriage in 2000, and did not resume that until 2004. From 2007 he used ice on average twice a month, thereafter escalating to weekly usage. 25 The offender acknowledged that his actions were illegal and that he knew that to be the case. He said his drug usage had affected his judgments. Authorities26 Counsel have referred to various authorities. Three specific cases seem to me to be relevant: 27 In R-v-SC [2008] NSWCCA 29 Justice Price at [35] referred to Judicial Commission statistics which were relevant to on Commonwealth matters involving low level trafficable quantities of cocaine and heroin after the repeal of s 16G of the Commonwealth Crimes Act.28 That decision followed the guidelines determined in the High Court and Court of Criminal Appeal decision of Wong & Leung v R  HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 where originally a range of head sentences was between 5 to 7 years imprisonment. 29 In R-v-Solomons [2000] NSWCCA 215, a sentence of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 ½ years imprisonment was upheld on appeal. What was involved there was importation of ecstasy.30 In R-v-Schluenz [2001] NSWCCA 314, the Court (Spigelman CJ Grove J Enfield AJ) upheld a sentence of 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years. What was involved was a trafficable quantity of methamphetamine involving 83.2 grams of pure methamphetamine. There were some personal circumstances for the offender and her dependents which are not relevant here.31 I note that as was said in N v R; AP v R  [2009] NSWCCA 108 that there is limited authority and reliance on authorities prior to 2003 following the repeal of s 16G. Since that time the authorities indicate that there should be generally higher sentences.Consideration 32 I am required to take into account the matters set out in Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 and more specifically the matters set out in s 16A(2) of that legislation. That provides a “check list” of the matters a court should take into account when sentencing a federal offender.33 The governing principle under s. 16A(1) is the imposition of a sentence that is of a “severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence”. In addition, the Court must consider the matters adverted to in s 16A(2). Although general deterrence is not specifically mentioned in s 16A(2), it is nonetheless a factor that the court must take into account.34 The Crown submits that various s 16A matters are relevant in relation to the nature and circumstances of the offence: The role of the offender35 The Court of Criminal Appeal has indicated that it is relevant to assess the level at which the offender operated in an organisation in order to determine the level of culpability. In The Queen v Olbrich [1999] 199 CLR 270, the High Court recognised that it was generally appropriate to categorise offenders in that manner for sentencing purposes where possible as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “…it is always necessary, whether one or several offenders are to be dealt with in connection with a single importation of drugs, to bear steadily in mind the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced. Characterising the offender as a “courier” or a “principal” must not obscure the assessment of what the offender did.” 
        
       
      
    36 The Crown submits that the version given by the offender of his involvement in this importation suggests that his role is that of the importer, rather than a courier or other type of intermediary, if evidence is adduced that suggests the offender played such a lesser role, I should bear in mind that the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal has said on a number of occasions that couriers and intermediaries should not receive any particular leniency because, without them, the trade in narcotics would not exist. The weight of the narcotics37 The amount of the relevant drug is not the only factor to be taken into account on sentence but it is one of the relevant factors relating to the nature and circumstances of the offence under s 16A(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1914. The majority of the High Court in Wong v R acknowledged that weight was relevant in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
         
        “The weight of the narcotic which is imported is given statutory significance for sentencing purposes by the Parliament’s distinguishing between the maximum sentences that may be imposed for offences involving trafficable and commercial quantities. No doubt, within both of those categories, the particular amount of narcotic involved can have significance in fixing the sentence that is to be imposed on an offender” 
        
       
      
    38 In R v Lee NSWCCA 234, the Court affirmed that the size of the importation is a relevant factor to which the sentencing court must have regard. 39 The Code specifically provides for different penalties based on the weight of the relevant drug. In this case the maximum penalty for a marketable quantity (which is an amount in excess of 2 grams of methamphetamine) is 25 years imprisonment, whereas for a commercial quantity (which is an amount in excess of 0.75 kilograms of methamphetamine) the maximum penalty is life imprisonment. Purity40 The pure quantity of methamphetamine imported in this case was 83.3 grams, the gross quantity being 113.5 grams. The drugs were of considerable purity – being 73.4% pure. The pure quantity is over 41 times higher than the prescribed minimum amount for a marketable quantity. Value41 Federal Agent Rob Gilder of the Australian Federal Police has estimated the street value of the drugs to be between $28,375 and $90,800. The wholesale value has been estimated to be between $24,300 and $40,500. 42 Details provided by the Australian Federal Police show that the street value of the “ice”, if sold by the gram, was between $28,000 and $62,000. If sold by lesser amounts of 0.1 of a gram the street value was between $56,000 and $90,000.43 The Crown concedes that a portion of the drugs was imported by the offender for his own personal use. However, it is also submitted that the larger proportion of the drug was imported by the offender with the intention that it be sold.Offender’s Involvement44 The Crown submits that in making an assessment of the proportion of the drugs that were for the offender’s own use there are a number of matters that the Court would take into consideration. It is clear from his travel records that he was intending to travel back to Indonesia on 31 August 2008 (Exhibit S4) – not that he was going to stay in Australia as he apparently told Dr Jacmon and could be inferred by his evidence before me. The offender’s movement record shows that he was a frequent international traveller and in the six months prior to the offence he had a pattern of travel which typically involved him spending the majority of his time in southeast Asia and returning to Australia every one to two months for 9 to 14 days at a time. There is a strong inference that the offender had the opportunity to source drugs during his travel. Furthermore, based on the psychologist’s report of Dr Jacmon dated 6 April 2009, the offender’s methamphetamine use is described as having peaked at 2 grams per week. He was found with 113 grams.Prior convictions45 The offender’s criminal history was tendered (Exhibit S2).46 The offender has three prior drug-related convictions, including one conviction for trafficking methamphetamine in January 2002. The offender received community based sentences for each of those convictions. In my view there was considerable leniency extended to the offender when he received a 12 months community service order for trafficking involving 29 grams of amphetamines. Personal47 Clearly these convictions and the (lenient) sentences imposed have had no effect in deterring him from involving himself in drug enterprises. I have little confidence that the offender has any real insight into his offending behaviour or that he is not likely to re-offend. The sentence imposed should carry with it a strong component of personal deterrence. 48 In Veen v The Queen [No 2] (1998) 164 CLR 465 the majority said:  
     
      
       
        
        The antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor, which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty, which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences:  
        DPP v Ottewell 
        . The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, (and I regard that as being the case here) retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted.  
         
        
       
      
    Plea of guilty49 Here there has been a plea of guilty subject to the matters set out, there have been some limited savings in terms of the time and resources of the Commonwealth DPP, the police as well as the court system. 50 After initially pleading guilty to the offence at Central Local Court on 17 December 2008 the offender then reversed his plea of guilty on 23 April 2009 in the District Court. The matter was listed for trial to commence on 29 June 2009. The plea came on what would have been the second day of the trial, 30 June 2009, and prior to a jury being empanelled but after an application was mounted and lost by the defence for exclusion of certain prosecution evidence. Witnesses were in attendance at court and one prosecution witness had attended from interstate. 51 The offender made limited admissions to the Australian Federal Police but did not assist the authorities further in the investigation of this offence. However he cannot be penalised for a lack of assistance.52 I regard the appropriate discount in the area of 10%. I do not regard the plea as constituting a significant indication of contrition. There were conflicting stories advanced as to whether he, or a friend was to sell the drugs used and how long he intended to stay in Australia. Further, I see no evidence of any real assistance to authorities or willingness to facilitate the course of justice on a wider level. His contrition and associated preparedness to abandon that lifestyle might have more verisimilitude if that was the case.Findings53 I find that the offender obtained these drugs from abroad and deliberately bought them into Australia. He was not acting simply on behalf of another as a minder or a warehouseman but intended to be actively involved in the distribution of these drugs to others.54 I find him to have been an importer, a principal rather than simply a courier.55 This was not simply a matter for his personal use – despite the fact that he clearly had, and has, an addiction. 56 In my view there were mixed motives for the offender’s possession of the drugs. It would have clearly involved his contact with others in the drug trade.Level of culpability57 The drugs were concealed and were discovered in the course of travel from Indonesia where the offender was recently treated for drug addiction. 58 The concealment was clumsy and unsophisticated. Defence counsel submits that it was an indication of both a lack of judgement or impaired judgement rather than any planning and premeditation.59 I find that the level of culpability is mid-range.Matters taken into account60 I take into account the factors set out in s 16A matters set out above including in particular, the circumstances of the offence, the method of detection, the nature, weight and purity of the drug as well as the offender’s personal circumstances. What is also relevant is the mixture of motives for the offence both for commercial profit and personal use.61 This offender is a mature, intelligent, educated and well-travelled individual. He must have known the seriousness of the offence. The requirement of general and personal deterrence mandate a condign penalty.Sentencing options62 The pre-sentence report notes that the offender is unsuitable for either a community service order or for a periodic detention order because of his prior non-compliance with a Victorian community based order.63 In any event the gravity of this offence, in particular the amount of the drugs taken, render any penalty other than the imposition of a full time period of custody inappropriate.64 Clearly incarceration in an Australian Correctional setting will be onerous for him given his relative linguistic, cultural and social isolation. He is likely to be depressed in any custodial setting Adjustments: Parole65 The Court of Criminal Appeal has said that it is generally appropriate for the ratio of the non-parole period to head sentence, duly adjusted having regard to all relevant subjective factors to be approximately 60% to 66.6%: R-v-Bernier (1998) 102 A Crim R 44. The usual practice of setting the ratio of the non-parole period within this range is not a rigid mathematical formula or fixed process but rather it requires finely tuned assessment. It is not an immutable practice. Here the appropriate ratio is 66.66%.66 That adjustment is appropriate to ensure that there can be a period of time on parole on some realistic conditions in this case.67 In terms of the date of commencement of the sentencing process, given the factors I have outlined, an appropriate head sentence would be 9 years imprisonment. The discount of 10% for the plea would result in a sentence (rounded down) of 96 months or 8 years. The appropriate non-parole period would be 62 months or 5 years and 2 months imprisonment.Date of commencement68 The offender has been in gaol since 20 August 2008. It is agreed that his sentence should take effect from that date.Sentence69 The offender is sentenced to a term of non-parole imprisonment of 5 years and 2 months commencing on 20 August, 2008 and expiring on 19 October 2013 and an additional term of 27 months expiring on 19 January 2016. 70 I direct that he be released to parole on that date.Parole71 I recommend that on his release to parole the offender be released on good behaviour subject to you comply with the directions of the Probation and Parole Service and notify that service of his address and occupation and any travel plans he has at least 21 days before such travel and his return to Australia within 21 days of his return.72 That he comply with any conditions imposed by the Probation and Parole service including random urine testing and treatments for his drug addiction.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The court heard this appeal on 25 August 2007 when it determined that the appeal should be dismissed. These are my reasons for joining in those orders. 
     
      
    2 The respondent pleaded guilty to one count of reckless wounding contrary to s 35(4) of the Crimes Act 1900 and one count of possessing a loaded firearm so as to endanger life contrary to s 93G(1)(a)(ii) of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence contrary to s 35(4) carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years. There is a standard non-parole period of 3 years. The offence contrary to s 93G carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. There is no standard non-parole period for this offence. 
     
      
    3 The respondent was sentenced for the s 35(4) offence to a total term of imprisonment of 1 year and 10 months and 15 days with a non-parole period of 6 months. For the s 93G(1) offence he was given the same sentence. The sentencing judge ordered that the sentences be served concurrently. The non-parole period is due to expire on 16 November 2009. 
     
      
    4 The respondent was also sentenced in respect of 5 related matters referred to the District Court for sentence pursuant to a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 being: 
     
      
       
       For 2 offences of possessing ammunition without licence/permit contrary to s 65(3) of the  
      Firearms Act  
      1996 (maximum penalty fine of $5,500): pursuant to s 10A of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      1999 the respondent was convicted but no further penalty was imposed. 
       
        
       
       For 2 offences of possessing an unregistered firearm contrary to s 36(1) of the  
      Firearms Act  
      1996 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 2 years and/or $5,500 fine: concurrent sentences of fixed terms of imprisonment being 6 months in relation to a Winchester 12 gauge shotgun and 4 months and 15 days in relation to a Winchester .22 rifle these sentences being wholly concurrent with the sentences for the substantive offences. 
       
       
       one offence of failing to keep a firearm safely contrary to s39(1)(a) of the  
      Firearms Act  
      1996 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 12 months and/or a $2,200 fine imprisonment for a fixed term of 4 months made wholly concurrent with the term of imprisonment for the substantive offences. 
       
      
    5 The Crown appeals the penalty imposed for the substantive offences. However, it was not submitted that any error was made in relation to the sentence for the five related matters. 
     
      
    6 The respondent was sentenced on 23 June 2009 and served with the notice of appeal on 2 July 2009. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    7 The respondent pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. At the sentence hearing an agreed statement of facts was tendered. The respondent also gave evidence.  
     
      
    8 The respondent and the victim Jennifer Barker had maintained a domestic relationship for approximately 37 years. They had 4 adult children. Mrs Barker lived with 2 of her daughters. She was in relatively poor health, had suffered a number of strokes and experienced considerable difficulty in maintaining her mobility.  
     
      
    9 The respondent was employed on a large rural station situated approximately 45 kilometres south west from Bourke. He lived in a cottage on the station during the week and stayed in Bourke on weekends. 
     
      
    10 During the evening of 22 July 2007 the respondent drank after work. It was his usual habit to consume 3 full bottles of beer each afternoon. However, on this occasion the shearing on the station had finished and, as was usual, the drinking continued into the evening. The respondent gave evidence, which was accepted by his Honour that during drinks after work on a number of evenings leading up to the night of the attack one of the shearers had told him that he was “running around with (his wife).” On the evening of 22 July the respondent consumed “quite a bit more” than the 3 bottles he usually drank. He gave evidence that he kept thinking about what he had been told and it ultimately “got too much for me.”  
     
      
    11 He decided to go to town. He took a taxi and had with him an esky which contained 7 or 8 bottles of beer and a knife. He was also carrying a bag containing a loaded shortened 12 gauge Winchester single barrel shotgun, seven live shotgun cartridges, a piece of orange plastic pipe about 2 metres long and a length of rope about 3.5 metres long. When he arrived at his wife’s premises he went into her bedroom. Mrs Barker was resting on the bed under a blanket and one of her adult daughters was asleep beside her. The respondent pulled the blanket off Mrs Barker and struck her hard with the orange pipe on her left leg and arm about 5 or 6 times. He was yelling at her angrily and asked her who the man in bed with her was. He poked her in the chest with the piece of pipe causing bruising. 
     
      
    12 His daughter woke up, got out of bed and told her father to stop it. He responded by telling her to stand back and continued to hit Mrs Barker. His daughter ran out of the room and his wife, who was very frightened, asked the respondent to leave her alone saying “don’t hurt me.” 
     
      
    13 The respondent left the bedroom and went to the lounge room where he picked up the shotgun. He came back to the bedroom and standing one foot away from Mrs Barker aimed the shotgun at her chest and said “you’re not going to see your grandkids grow up because I am going to shoot you.” He said that he was going to kill her and then kill himself. Mrs Barker saw the respondent’s hand on the trigger of the gun. She also saw the respondent put 3 shotgun cartridges into his left hand shirt pocket.  
     
      
    14 The respondent did not carry out his threat and ultimately put the shotgun down. He then produced a length of rope, tied one end to the bedpost, and wrapped the rope around Mrs Barker’s throat at least twice. He then picked up the shotgun by the barrel and struck Mrs Barker twice on the head with the stock of the gun. Mrs Barker felt immediate pain and a sensation of blood coming from her head. She yelled out to her 2 daughters to get the police. The respondent told his daughters to stay out of the room and pacing up and down accused Mrs Barker of “having men, having parties up there.”  
     
      
    15 The police arrived about 11.30 pm. The respondent emerged from the bedroom and came down the hallway. He had blood on his face and hands. He told some untruths to the police, including that there were no firearms in the house. The police searched the premises and found Mrs Barker who had retreated to the second bedroom. She had a large amount of blood covering her clothing, face and head. When taken to hospital she was found to have 2 deep lacerations on the vertex of her scalp measuring 6 and 7 cms in length. The wounds required stitches. Mrs Barker subsequently developed symptoms consistent with a stroke and was transferred from Bourke Hospital to Dubbo Base Hospital for treatment. 
     
      
    16 The respondent was searched. He was found to have 6 shotgun rounds in the side pockets of his jacket. Blood was found on the shotgun barrel and there was blood on the bedroom mattress and doona cover. The shotgun was found to contain one unused cartridge. The respondent accused the police officer of planting the round in the weapon. 
     
      
    17 When the premises were searched a large knife was found in the bathroom basin. Both the blade and the basin had apparent blood staining. The police found a length of rope on the floor in front of the toilet. The rope was stained with blood and one end of it appeared to have been cleanly cut. In the main bedroom the police found a piece of white rope tied to one of the bed head posts. Its free end was cleanly cut and had the appearance of being blood stained. 
     
      
    18 The respondent’s cottage on the rural station was searched and the police found four live shotgun shells in a suitcase under the bed, a live .22 round on a coffee table and a loaded Winchester .22 lever action rifle which contained 3 bullets. 
     
      
    19 When the respondent was interviewed by police he said that he had “a few to drink.” He said he had only put the rope partly around Mrs Barker’s neck because he was trying to get information from her. He said that he was trying to frighten her because he wanted to know what was happening with “the affair with another fella.” He said he never intended to hurt her but just to frighten her. He said that he did not know that the shotgun was loaded. 
     
      
    20 He says that he brought the firearm from “out at Booker” which is further from Bourke than his usual residence. He said that he got it out of a rubbish tin. He told the police that he had not used firearms before and had no licence. He said that when he found the firearm he did not check if it was loaded. 
     
      
       
      The remarks of the sentencing judge 
       
      
    21 The sentencing judge gave careful consideration to the circumstances of each offence and the personal situation of the respondent. His Honour accepted that when questioned about the matter of the gun being loaded the respondent’s answer was not correct. However, he was not “satisfied beyond reasonable doubt it was deliberately untrue.” 
     
      
    22 His Honour accepted that although the respondent gave some answers which were helpful when interviewed some of what he said was not true. His Honour was satisfied that the respondent had put the rope around his wife’s neck to try and get information from her about another boyfriend. His Honour did not accept that the respondent obtained the shotgun in the manner he had suggested. He said: “my view is the firearm was somewhere on (the station).” His Honour was sceptical about the respondent’s suggestion that he brought the firearm only with the intention of frightening his wife “because she wouldn’t let me know what was happening about the affair with another fella.” His Honour observed that the respondent brought the gun to the premises before he knew that his wife would not cooperate. 
     
      
    23 His Honour accepted that the respondent felt sorry about what he had done. Although in his statement the respondent said he was thinking “revengeful thoughts” when hitting his wife, having regard to the respondent’s poor level of literacy, his Honour believed that the word “revengeful” had probably been suggested to him. His Honour accepted that the respondent had had nothing to eat during the day. However, his Honour did not accept that the respondent’s evidence that he had not used firearms before. 
     
      
    24 The sentencing judge was satisfied that the respondent was affected by alcohol and that he had consumed more than he usually would because of the impact the malicious gossip about his wife had upon him. His Honour was satisfied that the respondent believed that what he had been told about his wife was true. A prior arrangement had been made for his wife to ring him at about 7 pm that evening. When this did not happen the respondent believed it was because his wife was being unfaithful to him. The sentencing judge was satisfied that the respondent was “deeply troubled, distressed, dismayed by his beliefs which when coupled with alcohol morphed into an anger and a determination to frighten his wife and find, out if he could, more about what was happening.” 
     
      
    25 Although the respondent was carrying a knife his Honour was not satisfied that it was in his possession for any purpose related to his anger. His Honour was satisfied that upon entering the bedroom and finding two occupants in the bed, his worst fears were realised (wrongly as it turned out) and that discovery contributed to his subsequent behaviour. 
     
      
    26 At the time of the incident the property upon which the respondent worked was about to be sold. His Honour accepted that this caused the respondent concern that he may lose his job and that because of his age, and race, his employment prospects on the open market would be uncertain. 
     
      
    27 His Honour found that the respondent had used the rope to tie his wife to the bed so that she was unable to move to release herself. His Honour concluded that the daughter had used a knife to cut the rope. Although a bloodstained knife was found in the bathroom his Honour believed this had been handled by the daughter and not by the respondent. 
     
      
    28 His Honour considered the objective criminality of the offences. In so doing he was careful to identify the fact that all citizens have a right to the “integrity of their body.” His Honour said that “any authority that a male once had to chastise his partner has long, long been abolished.” His Honour also observed that these issues were of particular concern in Aboriginal communities. 
     
      
    29 His Honour recognised that one of the prime purposes of sentencing is the protection of the community and in that respect one of the largest groups in the community who are in peril are female partners from abusing male partners. His Honour recognised that the law seeks to protect the whole community and does not distinguish on the basis of gender, colour or race. His Honour said “a belief that one’s partner has been unfaithful, no matter how painfully held, or how reasonably held, cannot, excuse any physical assault, let alone having the violence of this assault.”  
     
      
    30 His Honour found that the wounding was caused by 2 strikes with the butt of a shotgun. The wounds bled. At the time Mrs Barker had only a limited capacity to move her head having been tied in a manner which restricted her movements. His Honour found that “beyond reasonable doubt the stock of the shotgun was aimed at her head the level of recklessness involved was high.” His Honour found that in effect 3 weapons were used, the polythene pipe, the shotgun and the rope. His Honour concluded that the use of the rope aggravated the wounding charge. Mrs Barker was a vulnerable victim because of her health problems and the fact that she was surprised in her bed at home. His Honour was satisfied that “the presentation of a shotgun a foot or so from her must have been simply terrifying.” He said that “the pointing of a loaded shotgun accompanied by the words ‘you’re not going to see your grandkids grow up, cause I’m going to shoot you’, his announcement that he was going to kill himself”, were all matters that must have caused extreme levels of fear and stress. His Honour was satisfied that Mrs Barker was under attack for a sustained period although its full duration was unclear. Although he found that the respondent came equipped to frighten his wife he accepted that the wounding offence was not planned and was the result of rising anger at the scene. His Honour was satisfied that he took the weapon with him in order to frighten his wife. His Honour accepted that the respondent did not know that the shot gun was loaded and found that the endangerment of life came from aiming it at Mrs Barker coupled with the threat of discharge and from using it to strike his wife on the forehead. 
     
      
    31 Although his Honour was of the view that the respondent’s belief that his wife had been unfaithful was no excuse for his behaviour he found that it was genuinely held and that it was not unreasonable that he came to such a belief. His Honour concluded that he may have been more vulnerable to responding emotionally because of his prevailing uncertainty about his prospects of employment. His Honour accepted that he consumed more than his usual amount of alcohol because of his emotional distress at the time. 
     
      
    32 His Honour concluded that the objective factors relevant to the offence indicated a level of objective seriousness falling “below the lower rungs of the mid range of seriousness.” His Honour rejected a Crown submission that the respondent had a plan to wound his wife concluding that there was a plan to frighten her. His Honour concluded that the offences were at the lower area of the mid range because the wounds were relatively modest. Although his Honour concluded that the use of a shotgun was common to both offences “in the wounding offence the result of the use of the weapon are the two wounds.” In relation to the firearm offence his Honour concluded that “the result of its possession was the endangering of life.” 
     
      
    33 With respect to subjective matters his Honour identified the fact that the respondent was 59 years of age. He has four children with his wife and a number of grandchildren. His son works with him and he watches out for and directs him at his work. 
     
      
    34 The respondent left school at age 14. Although he is able to read he is not fluent. He has worked his entire life on rural properties. He has been employed for approximately 45 years and has worked to acquire his own home. The concerns which the respondent experienced when the rural station was sold have not materialised. The new owners have kept the respondent on and have indicated a preparedness to resume his employment when he is released from custody. The previous owner gave the respondent a reference in which he said that at times “Barker had complete access and control of the property on his own.” This is not without significance. The rural property runs sheep and cattle over a total area of 50,000 hectares. 
     
      
    35 The respondent suffers from high blood pressure and asthma both of which are controlled. Although it is apparent that he consumes significant quantities of alcohol it appears that he is not dependent on it. He does not smoke and denied that he uses any illicit substances.  
     
      
    36 Until this incident there was no evidence that the respondent had ever been violent to his wife. He had no prior convictions. His Honour accepted that he “regretted his behaviour and loved his wife” and … “genuinely believed his wife had been unfaithful.” His Honour found that before leaving the house after his arrest his actions were to “grab his wife, kiss her, and tell her he was sorry.” 
     
      
    37 His Honour indicated that he would make a finding in relation to “a malicious wounding charge”. I assume that his Honour was referring to the charge of “reckless wounding.” His Honour said that when taking account of the objective seriousness of the offence it fell below the mid range of seriousness and that the subjective features would take the offence below the mid range to a point “half way between a trivial offence and a mid range offence.” 
     
      
    38 His Honour remarked on the need for deterrence both general and personal to be reflected in sentences for domestic violence. However, his Honour concluded that the respondent’s actions were an aberration and that he was most unlikely to reoffend diminishing the need for a sentence reflecting personal deterrence. When passing sentence his Honour emphasised that “full weight must be given to the competing public interest and rehabilitation of the offender and avoidance of recidivism.” His Honour concluded that a period of full time imprisonment was inevitable and “that a short sharp period of custody is called for.” His Honour found special circumstances and although a prison term was necessary to punish the offender in other respects the respondent would have been better left in the community to rehabilitate himself.  
     
      
       
      The Crown submissions 
       
      
    39 The appellant submitted that his Honour had made a number of factual errors and, because of those matters and other errors, this Court should intervene and impose a more significant sentence. Although I would have been sceptical about the issue, as a matter of fact his Honour’s finding that the respondent did not know that the shotgun was loaded was open to him. There was no evidence to the contrary. However, that finding was contrary to the plea which the respondent had entered. It was open to his Honour to find that the respondent obtained the shotgun from the rural station rather than from another location. The Crown submitted his Honour’s finding that it was unlikely that the respondent used the word “revengeful” without it being suggested to him was not open. I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in this respect but if he did, it was an error without consequence. 
     
      
    40 Apart from these factual matters the appellant submitted that his Honour erred in his findings with respect to the objective seriousness of the reckless wounding offence and as a consequence imposed a sentence which was manifestly inadequate. A similar submission was made in relation to the offence relating to the possession of a loaded firearm. It was further submitted that his Honour erred by ordering that the sentences should be served concurrently. 
     
      
    41 I have previously related some of his Honour’s remarks in relation to the offence of reckless wounding. The sentencing judge concluded that the objective factors brought the offence within the lower rungs of the mid range of seriousness. His Honour then found that the subjective features of the respondent had the consequence that the offence was “about half way between a trivial offence and a mid range offence.” By considering subjective matters to be relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence his Honour erred. 
     
      
    42 The principles which must be considered when the penalty for an offence includes a standard non-parole period were summarised by Kirby J in MLP v R (2006) 164 A Crim R 93 at 33-34 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The non parole period is, of course, but one aspect of the sentence. In respect of an offence where there is a standard non parole period, the sentencing Judge must at some point address the following issues when imposing a custodial sentence: 
        
       
       
        
         
          First, what term of imprisonment is appropriate having regard to the offence and the circumstances of the offender? Guidance may be provided by the maximum penalty, statistics from the Judicial Commission and the collective wisdom emerging from a range of sentences involving similar conduct (cf R v Trevenna (2004) 149 A Crim R 505, per Barr J; R v George (2004) 149 A crim R 38). 
         
         
          Secondly, should the offence be characterised as being in the mid-range of objective seriousness? That task should be approached in the manner suggested by Simpson J, intuitively evaluating the objective seriousness of the offence and looking to those matters in s 21A, aggravating or mitigating, that relate to the offence (including the offender's state of mind). Matters in s 21A which form part of what is usually termed ""the subjective case"" of the offender are not relevant to the issue of whether the offence falls within the mid-range. If the offence falls within the mid-range, the standard non parole period should apply, subject to the remaining issues. 
         
         
          Thirdly, are there other reasons in the matters identified in s 21A (relating to the offender) for departing from the standard non parole period? The subjective case of the offender (issues such as youth or prospects of rehabilitation (s 21A(3)(h)) may furnish reasons for departing from the standard non parole period. It should be noted that s 21A(1) provides that the matters specifically identified in the subparagraphs of s 21A are in addition to any other matter that the Court is required or permitted to take into account under any Act or rule of law. The fact that the offender may need to serve his sentence in protection, for instance, although not mentioned in s 21A(3), may be taken into account in determining whether there should be a departure from the standard non parole period. 
         
         
          Fourthly, there is the issue of special circumstances. Ordinarily, the non parole period bears a relationship to the term of the sentence defined by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that is, the non parole period must not be less than three quarters of the term, unless there are special circumstances. The sentencing Judge is therefore required to address that issue. If there is to be an adjustment, then it must not so deplete the non parole period that it is reduced below the minimum term which justice requires the offender to serve (Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628; Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525; 47 A Crim R 433). 
         
         
        There is no requirement that these issues be addressed in any particular order (R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114; 49 A Crim R 20), although the issues are obviously inter-related such that a decision on one aspect may have implications for another. In addressing these issues, the sentencing Judge should, however, bear in the mind the following advice provided in R v Way: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The desirability of a judge adopting the practice of standing back after reaching a provisional sentence, and of reviewing it so as to be sure that it is appropriate for the offence at hand (see the observations made in R v McGourty [2002] NSWCCA 335 at [45]) cannot be understated, and the existence of a standard non-parole period is likely to be of assistance in this respect.’ “ 
          
         
        
       
      
    43 MLP followed the consideration given to the relevant principles in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 particularly at [122]. When for reasons which may include a plea of guilty, the standard non-parole period is not of direct relevance it nevertheless remains relevant as a guidepost in the sentencing process (R v Jenkins [2006] NSWCCA 412 at [27]) see also R v Tory and Tory [2006] NSWCCA 18 at [42]. 
     
      
    44 The appellant also submitted that his Honour failed to properly evaluate the objective criminality of the offence of reckless wounding. The appellant emphasised that the attack upon his wife by the respondent was “prolonged, escalating, frightening and inherently dangerous due to her poor health”. After hitting her with the plastic pipe he threatened to kill her with a gun. He hit her over the head with the stock of the rifle not once but twice and bound her by the neck to the bed head with a rope. He had invaded her bedroom for the purpose.  
     
      
    45 It was submitted that his Honour had placed too much emphasis on the nature of the wounds inflicted when coming to his decision and that apart from the wounds there were other significant matters relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    46 The appellant further submitted that his Honour had made another significant error when considering the penalty for the offence contrary to s 93G. One of the elements of the offence was that he possessed “a loaded gun.” Accordingly, by his plea he admitted that he knew that the gun which he pointed at his wife was loaded. However, as I have indicated previously his Honour found that the respondent did not believe it was loaded, a finding which was contrary to the effect of the plea. 
     
      
    47 It was further submitted that the sentencing process was flawed because of a failure by his Honour to comply with the principles of Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 which requires the court to “fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider the question of accumulation or concurrence as well, of course, as questions of totality.” It was submitted that rather than give separate consideration to the appropriate sentence in each offence his Honour merely defined the same penalty with the same commencing dates. It was submitted that accordingly his Honour failed to give separate consideration to each offence and consider whether they should be made wholly or partially concurrent. It was submitted by so doing his Honour failed to identify and impose a penalty which reflected the gravity of the s 93G offence. 
     
      
    48 In my opinion the complaints which the appellant makes in the respects which I have identified are all to varying degrees justified. The plea acknowledged that the respondent knew the gun was loaded. Furthermore, as I have indicated his Honour failed to appropriately consider the matters relevant to the objective seriousness of the offences. I am satisfied that both offences were serious and leaving aside the respondent’s subjective circumstances both of them justified a significant prison term. The respondent violently attacked his wife, inflicted physical injuries and put her in fear of her life. She, effectively defenceless, was tied to her bed and humiliated. The courts must be mindful of the very serious impact which actions of this nature can have on the victim. In many situations, including the present case, women are vulnerable and effectively defenceless against violent attacks from men with whom they have a domestic relationship. The courts must ensure that the punishment imposed is adequate to both protect persons and deter others from perpetrating similar offences. 
     
      
    49 Although his Honour found the subjective circumstances of the respondent were of significance they could not ameliorate the seriousness of the offences to the degree identified by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    50 I am also satisfied that the criticism which the appellant made of the individual sentences is justified. His Honour did not approach the sentencing task as required by Pearce. There is no indication that he separately evaluated each offence determined the appropriate individual sentence and then considered issues of totality. 
     
      
    51 Notwithstanding these matters I have come to the conclusion that this is an exceptional case justifying this Court in the exercise of its residual discretion dismissing the appeal.  
     
      
    52 This Court has a residual discretion to refuse to intervene even when error has been established. For this purpose the court may look at matters which have occurred since the original sentence was imposed. In R v Todorovic [2008] NSWCCA 49 at [28] James J, with Mason P and Hislop J agreeing, said:  
     
      
       
        
        “On the hearing of Crown appeals against sentence the Court routinely admits evidence of matters occurring after the date of the original sentencing, on the limited basis that the evidence can be taken into account, if the Court proceeds to a re-sentencing of the respondent (and, indeed, in deciding the prior question whether, although a ground of appeal against sentence has been made out, the Court should, in the exercise of its discretion, decline to allow the Crown appeal).” 
        
       
      
    53 The factors that bear upon the exercise of the discretion are varied. The health of the respondent is one such factor (Regina v Hansel [2004] NSWCCA 436.) In the case of R v Yang [2002] NSWCCA 464; 135 A Crim R 237 at [45] Carruthers AJ, with Simpson J and Mathews AJ agreeing, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Bearing in mind the serious nature of the offence which the respondent committed and giving full weight to the subjective circumstances including her prior good character, it is necessary to conclude that a full time custodial sentence was called for. The resolution of this matter by the imposition of a recognisance was, if I may respectfully say so, manifestly inadequate.  
        
       
       
        
        However, that said, the question arises whether, bearing in mind the evidence now before this Court, it should dismiss the appeal in the exercise of its residual discretion. In view of the fragile state of the respondent’s health, which may in some way have contributed to the commission of the subject offence, I am of the view that this is a case which calls for the exercise of the Court’s residual discretion. I do not agree that a community service order is an appropriate alternative.  
        
       
       
        
        Justice must be tempered with mercy, and, accordingly I would propose that the appeal be dismissed.” 
        
       
      
    54 In the present case the respondent in an apparently drunken rage and provoked by talk that his wife was unfaithful to him lost control of himself committing the crimes to which he pleaded guilty. The offences were entirely out of character. His Honour found that the respondent is genuinely remorseful and will not reoffend.  
     
      
    55 There is evidence before this Court which was not objected to by the appellant (see R v Deng Mading Deng (2007) 176 A Crim R 1 at [28]) which indicates that the respondent has suffered greatly from his incarceration. He has been used to living and working on extensive rural properties outside of Bourke. He is not used to physical constraints and has been fearful for his safety within the prison system. He has been removed from his usual environment and transported to a corrective establishment in the Sydney region. He has attempted to commit suicide. 
     
      
    56 An unusual feature of the respondent’s circumstances is the support that he has received from his employer. The evidence before the sentencing judge was that he has for many years been given a position of very considerable responsibility in the management of his employer’s very large rural holding. Notwithstanding his offending his employers, a husband and wife, have continued to support him and will continue to employ him on his release from custody. Testament to their determination to assist the respondent’s rehabilitation was evident from their presence in court during the hearing of the appeal. If this Court was now to intervene and impose a further term of imprisonment it is likely that his adverse response to his incarceration will continue and maybe increased. His prospect of effective rehabilitation may be lost. 
     
      
    57 To my mind the total sentence imposed on the respondent was excessively lenient. A total sentence of 4 years with a 2 year non-parole period would have been more appropriate. But for my conclusion that this is a case when the residual discretion should be exercised a sentence of that order would have been appropriate. However, for the reasons I joined in the orders dismissing the appeal. 
     
      
    58 R A HULME J: I agree with the reasons of McClellan CJ at CL for the dismissal of the Crown appeal. 
     
      
    59 DAVIES J: I agree with the reasons of McClellan CJ at CL for the dismissal of the Crown appeal.

   JUDGMENT1. Archie Allen Shepherd is clearly very damaged goods packaged in the form a young athletic looking Aboriginal man. His evidence is that he was “raised to be wild”. Since adulthood (2004) he has been in and out of gaol four times. He sees, with some sense of frustration, that if this cycle keeps up he will die in custody. My view is that there is a very real possibility he will be a traumatic death in custody. 2. On this occasion his offending conduct, to which I shall shortly come, is so serious in its criminality he must spend a substantial period in custody. Archie Shepherd’s personal needs, particularly for psychotherapy and for some form of real personal support outside the gaol system are unlikely to be addressed within the gaol system. 3. Currently, he is housed in a gaol that appears to offer prisoners little more than a place to play cards and gamble tobacco rations. So far as I can determine none of his other periods in custody offered him any more. He was released from prison on 26 August 2008. Within a month he was on bail charged with an unrelated earlier assault upon the same victim. 4. By 11 November 2008, less than three months after his last release from gaol he was in custody again this time charged with the most serious offence of personal violence to date. The criminality of that offence is reflected in the charge presently before the Court to which he has pleaded guilty, namely, that between 29 October 2008 and 4 November 2008 at Broken Hill he recklessly wounded Twylla Dutton. There is also a summary charge to be sentenced and another to be withdrawn pursuant to s.166 Criminal Procedure Act . 5. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I try to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence before this Court committed by this offender harming this victim in this community. See Gladue v The Queen [1999] 1SCR 688 [80]. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to him, subjective matters. The starting point for such assessment requires me to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and the offender. 6. My fact finding task has been circumscribed in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts to which I shall shortly return. It is sufficient at this point that I remind the Court a judge is not a party to the agreed set of facts. The tender of agreed facts does not relieve the judge from his fact finding responsibility it simply limits the material from which those facts may be found. To that extent, if it be the case that the facts as agreed do not reflect the actual events that occurred it must be remembered that the Court can only find facts from the evidence placed before it.7. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, totality, back-up charges brought from the Local Court to be finalised in this Court, whether the offence attracts a standard non-parole period and if so the length of the parole period and finally, of course, the ultimate term of imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed. None of that can be determined until the primary facts are sorted out. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined. See R v Cuthbert (1967) 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740. 8. From the agreed set of facts that have been tendered I take the following to be established. Twylla Dutton and the offender, Archie Shepherd, had been in a casual boyfriend/girlfriend relationship, although they had known each other for most of their lives. On Friday 31 October 2008, Dutton and Shepherd began drinking VB beer between 9am and 10am at Chelsea Bugmy’s house in Creedy Street, Broken Hill. 9. Between 9pm and 10pm the victim and offender have attended 89 Creedy Street, Broken Hill. Once inside those premises they walked to a middle bedroom of that house and whilst in that room had consensual sexual intercourse. Shepherd then went to the toilet. 10. Upon his return he became enraged in relation to an old family feud between their respective families involving, as I understand it, the murder of a relative of Shepherd’s. He started abusing her; calling her a slut, whore and other derogative remarks. He shoved her onto the bed and ripped all her clothing off including her underwear.  11. He located a piece of curtain tubing approximately 600 to 800 millimetres in length and began using it to assault her around the body numerous times causing immediate pain and bruising. During the assault he stabbed her with the sharp end of the tubing causing a laceration to her left foot and left thigh area causing immediate pain with the wound bleeding. He told her to sit on the corner of the double bed with her legs spread open and to insert the tubing into her vagina. I have no doubt he did not use that language. 12. She told him she did not want to do this, closed her legs in a cross over fashion tightly so that he would be unable to do this to her. He hit her around the top of the thigh causing pain. He attempted to push the tubing closer to the vagina but she grabbed the tubing and pushed it away from her. This further enraged him, he began to strike her with the tubing around her body causing marks and pain. He bit her on the right thigh just above the right knee leaving an imprinted bite mark on her skin that was visible seven days later when the photographs were taken. He grabbed her left hand placing two of her fingers in his mouth and bit them causing immediate pain. She hit him three or four times with her closed fist attempting, successfully, to free her hand from his mouth. 13. Ms Dutton told police the assault stopped at sunrise. She was given clothing by him different to the clothing she earlier wore so that they could leave those premises together. They walked towards the police station so he could report on bail in relation to the earlier assault I mentioned upon her. Shepherd attended his bail reporting, once out of the station they walked to 413 William Street Broken Hill. At this address they went to a bedroom and began watching television. 14. She again asked to be allowed to seek medical assistance as her leg was in pain as was her mouth. She was refused. She fell asleep waking approximately twelve hours later around 8pm on Saturday 1 November. She awoke to soreness to her head and body area. Again, she requested to leave to attend hospital. He threatened to flog her as he had the previous night. 15. On Sunday, fearing she would be assaulted further she did not attend hospital or the police station to report the matter. On Monday 3 November 2008, she awoke at 413 William Street and was assaulted by his punching her to the mouth area causing the already existing injury on her lip to split and bleed again. The two attended the Centrelink office in Argent Street, Broken Hill so that he could submit a claim form. 16. It is at this time she informed Shepherd she had an appointment with the office and entered an office area. She then explained to a staff member that she required someone to contact the Aboriginal Health Service so that she could get away from the offender and receive medical treatment for her injuries. The call was made and a short time later she was collected in the rear lane. Whilst this was occurring Shepherd left Centrelink. 17. Ms Dutton went to Maari Ma Health Clinic and was treated for her injuries including four sutures to her lip area. The expert report makes this comment so far as some of the wounds were concerned: 
     
      
      “The patient had single wounds to her left thigh and dorsum of her left foot. Both were similar in appearance and several days old. They measured approximately one centimetre by a half centimetre and involved epidermal and dermal skin layers. They had purulent ooze and surrounding erythema indicative of infection”.  
      
    That’s what happens when you don’t treat your wounds and the infection can lead to all sorts of more serious complications. Having finished with Maari Ma Health Clinic she hid herself with her sister to avoid further contact with the offender. 18. On Monday 10 November, that is seven days later, she attended Broken Hill Police Station with her sister and reported the matter to police. A comprehensive statement was obtained, photographs obtained and a buccal swab undertaken. 19. At 9:45am on Tuesday the 11th, Archie Shepherd was arrested at Broken Hill at the police station after he reported on bail. I noted the photos were taken seven or eight days after the assault. They show fourteen injury sites including a semicircular site on the right leg that could only be consistent with a bite. The ill treatment of Ms Dutton continued from the point in time when the offender returned to the bedroom and began abusing her on late 31 October or early 1 November until 3 November 2008. 20. Archie Shepherd says in evidence, he was thinking of the demise of his young son and took it out upon the complainant. In the agreed facts, it was the violent death of his relative at the hands of some member of the Dutton family. I accept that he may well have been troubled by each of these sad, indeed traumatic events at the time of his offending, but am at a loss to understand the causal link between these terrible memories and his sudden and prolonged assault upon a person who he was in the process of courting. Objective Criminality21. From the facts as he finds them to be the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of Archie Shepherd. That will be done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in this case with criminality of other offences of a similar kind. It is in that way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of this offence can be measured. The objective criminality has an important, indeed the most important, impact upon the sentencing outcome. 22. It goes without saying that the fundamental right of all citizens is the right to the integrity of their body. Put simply, no one, not even officials of the government such as police or Corrective Service officers have the right to harm anyone without some lawful authority. While that authority may take various forms, absent lawful authority any harm coming to another is viewed as anti social conduct, that is, conduct against society and therefore a breach of the criminal law. 23. Some Aboriginal men may argue that traditional Aboriginal culture tolerated violence by a man towards his woman. Whatever may be the true position so far as past traditional Aboriginal culture is concerned, the continual and widespread reporting of domestic violence by Aboriginal women makes clear that Aboriginal women are no longer prepared to tolerate a domestic relationship that permits violence towards them, and for my money they are the heroines in this. 24. In this country whatever past or foreign culture may have permitted, violence within a domestic situation is regarded as a crime subject to the same maximum sentences that crime would carry if committed against other citizens outside the domestic situation. There is no law that says, “If you wound a stranger in a pub with a broken beer bottle the maximum penalty is seven years, but if you wound your partner in the bedroom in the same way, or indeed in other way, the maximum penalty should only be a rap over the knuckles.” 25. One of the prime purposes of sentencing is the protection of the community. One of the largest groups in our community who are in peril are female partners from abusing male partners. A considerable size or percentage of that group are indigenous women. The law seeks to protect the whole community, it does not distinguish on the basis of gender, ethnicity or colour. Indigenous women are entitled to protection, the law is required to do all it can to progress that protection. 26. This is an offence where the victim had been personally targeted, unlike say an assault in a pub brawl where a victim is in the wrong place at the wrong time. Twylla Dutton was targeted because of who she was and I think because of what she was to the accused. 27. As earlier mentioned the wounding occurred against a background of a sustained period of assault and ill treatment. The wounding occurred by use of a weapon, namely, a hollow piece of metal curtain rod. That by comparison with other weapons is not as dangerous as many other weapons but nonetheless it was capable of inflicting pain and wound. The wounding included a laceration to the left foot, to the left thigh; there was a third significant wound to the lip when it was split and she began to bleed again. There is what appears to be another wound to the right inner aspect of the hand close to where the right thumb joins it. There are other sites which look as they also may have been wound sites but I am unable to be satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt. These wounds are constituted by lacerations rather than stab wounds. They were not life threatening and did not require hospitalisation although did require medical treatment at the Maari ma Primary Health Care Centre including stitching for the lip. 28. The circumstances in which the wounding occurred were humiliating, demeaning and as to the injuries to the foot and thigh, in an atmosphere heavy with unsavoury and degrading sexual overtones. What aggravates the seriousness of this wounding are the circumstances in which it occurred- ongoing violence and ill treatment of Ms Dutton for a period from late 31 October to 3 November; the fact that he had attacked the same victim on an earlier occasion and was on bail for that offence; and finally, his persistent refusals to allow her out of his sight so she could seek medical attention. For reasons I have given this offence falls only just below a mid-range of seriousness of reckless wounding offences. It will be seen that I have rejected the submission of the prosecution. It is saved from falling into the mid-range by the relatively superficial level of wounding but as I said is aggravated by those features I referred to a moment ago lifting it to a more serious level. Victim Impact Statement29. I have received a victim impact statement from Twylla Dutton. The material contained in the statement is not sworn evidence and has not been subject to cross-examination. To the extent that opinions are expressed in it I recognise they are not opinions of a qualified expert. The victim impact statement coming as it does from the primary victim may if I accept it as reliable provide unsworn evidence as to the facts of the offences and their effect upon her. 30. The function of statements such as this one is firstly, to give the opportunity of being heard in sentencing proceedings to the victim by publicly identifying the impact of the trauma visited upon her by the actions of this offender. Secondly, to enable the sentence proceedings to assist her as she moves towards some closure of grief, resentment and brooding arising from the criminal conduct of the offender. Thirdly, the victim impact statement contributes to an offender at least hearing at first hand in a calmer atmosphere and perhaps gaining insight into the impact his offending had upon his victim. Finally, it is a constant reminder to judicial officers of trauma that is visited upon ordinary men and women as a result of criminal activity. Twylla Dutton says this in her victim impact statement: 
     
      
      “I am the victim of the acts of violence described in the statement of facts. After I was assaulted I was left with several physical injuries. I had a deep bite mark on my thigh, cuts on my arms, hand and palm, stab wound to the foot and scratches under my arm and chest. I also had a split lip, which needed four stitches. I can see the scar, which reminds me of what happened. After the incident my whole body was battered and sore. I suffered pain and discomfort for several weeks. While most of my physical injuries eventually faded the emotional scars have remained. Sometimes I can’t sleep because I blame myself. I wonder why he did it and all I can do is blame myself. I feel as though I deserved it and that I did something to make him angry. I know this isn’t true but I can’t help feeling like this every now and again. Other times I have nightmares about him and what he did to me. I don’t think I will ever stop being frightened of him. 
       
       
      After the assault I was embarrassed because everyone would stare at me and ask what had happened. They would ask me how he did it or why he did it. It was hard for me because being part of the Aboriginal community means that everyone in the community knows us. I know they make judgments about what happened and I feel like his family will blame me if he goes to gaol. I don't like the attention and I don't like having to explain the situation. Before the incident I was quite social and would happily go out with my friends and cousins. Afterwards while my injuries were still obvious, I would avoid doing these things as I felt embarrassed and guilty. I still feel self-conscious when I am in public even when I am no longer in Broken Hill. These events have also affected my family. I have three children who I did my best to hide to try and hide my injuries from. I hated for them to see the state I was in. I would lie to my daughter and say that I had fallen over when I was drunk or that I had run into a door. You could see the sadness in my daughter’s eyes when she would look at me, she would cuddle me and cry and tell me she loved me. It would make me feel heartbroken because I knew that she knew the truth. My mother also suffered. She worries a lot as she was the one who looked after me when I was injured. She stresses about me and my future. I am sad that she has been affected like this. After the acts of violence occurred, I had to leave Broken Hill. I couldn’t stand having people look at me. It made me feel like I shouldn’t be here in Broken Hill. I took my children to live in Bourke near their father as I wanted to make sure that they were in a stable home. I didn’t want their lives to be affected by all this. I didn’t want them to have to listen to all the talk or be exposed to the court case. While I lived in Bourke, I re-started my relationship with their father but that has since ended because of all of these legal matters. He didn’t like that I was always going to court. I want to live in Broken Hill but I’m afraid of the offender. I fear for my life and I feel like I have no choice but to move. I am really sad because most of my immediate family live in Broken Hill. I have had to leave my mother, stepfather, sisters and some cousins who all live here. I now have to start my life over somewhere else”. 
       
       
      
    31. And that concludes the victim impact statement.Subjective Matters32. I turn now to the subjective matters. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence but I am also sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to the offender may offer to the court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by this offender or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate.Family Background and Relationship33. Archie Shepherd is a single, twenty-six year old Aboriginal man born in Broken Hill. He told the Probation and Parole he was “given away” as a baby by his natural parents. He was raised by a maternal aunt and maternal grandmother. He first met his parents who by this time were separated when he was twelve. His father lives in Sydney, his mother in Darwin. There are occasions in the past four or five years when one or more of the natural parents and he have been in contact. My assessment is that he is really isolated. His maternal aunt died when he was seventeen or eighteen. One of her children whom he regarded as a brother and a person of importance, Bradley Johnson, has moved on. His grandmother lives in Adelaide. He had a son from a prior liaison although it would seem he played little part in the young (aged three or four) boy’s life because of custody and an AVO. He was confronted with the boy’s death whilst the child had been on a dentist’s chair during a dental procedure. At this time he was in custody. His father came from Sydney to bring the news. He was allowed to the funeral. My understanding is the relationship Twylla Dutton had ended with the first assault. As a child he witnessed domestic violence and habitual drunkenness. As best I can tell, he grew up mostly in Wilcannia. He said in evidence he found it hard to behave. “I was reared to be wild”. It seems these words sum up his upbringing. Education, Skills and Work Experience34. His evidence was that although he went to school he mostly wagged. He attended special classes. He repeated classes a couple of times before leaving school at the age of thirteen. It would appear he finished school at the end of year 7. There are notes on his PSR suggesting he may have played rugby league with sufficient skill to be selected for a representative side to play in south Australia. He told Probation and Parole he enjoys painting which he said he was good at. Regrettably I have not seen any of that work. When in the community he has no leisure interests or hobbies. It would appear he keeps fit whilst in custody.General Health35. As far as one can tell, Archie Shepherd is athletically fit. There would not appear to be any physical ailments that would inhibit his rehabilitation.Mental Health Issues36. This is a case in which the court would have been assisted by a full background personality and mental health profile. Without a report it is difficult to assess the effect of the numerous stressors and past dangerous health practices upon this offender’s psychic. 
     
     He was abandoned by both parents shortly after birth in circumstances that have clearly not been satisfactorily explained to him.  
     He lost two significant persons at the age of seventeen with the death of his surrogate mother and the departure of Bradley Johnson, a significant person who he respected and I dare say, loved as a brother. 
     He lost his first born son suddenly whilst in custody in circumstances of not knowing that boy well, although probably wanting to, and in circumstances where he had no access to the child for most of that boy’s life. 
     Two members of his family have been murdered including another aunty. 
      He told Probation and Parole he did not believe anyone would miss him if he killed himself and “no-one loves me”. As a young child he experienced levels of violence and other expressions of drunken dis-inhibition, some perhaps not yet revealed. 
      He concedes he used to get an adrenalin rush from watching people giving violence to others. My sense is at least superficially, he is not appalled by violence but experiences an emotional high from it. But what is further beneath the surface I cannot say. 
     He has abused himself with drugs and petrol to a point of probably acquiring brain damage. 
     He has attempted suicide by hanging while under the influence of some substance or other. 
     He says he finds it hard to behave when in the community and it would also seem while he is in custody. 
     His behaviour with his past two partners appears self- destructive in the extreme and contrary to his need for close personal support. As a matter of some urgency, he should be assessed by Justice Health as to his mental health and personality profiles. If, as I suspect, there are serious deficits in his mental health profile, best they are addressed while he is still relatively young and while he will have some time to serve. 
    Drugs and Alcohol37. Archie Shepherd in his evidence said he was sniffing petrol daily at the age of eleven. However in the Probation and Parole report of February 2008, he said he had started at six. It is more likely that the latter is correct. He told the court it made him feel as though he was in another world. His body would get numb. He would sometimes sniff to the point of being sick. 38. It was Bradley Johnson who got him off the petrol sniffing which says a lot about Bradley Johnson and a lot about the interaction between Johnson on the one hand and Archie Shepherd on the other. From the evidence it is difficult to determine with precision when that occurred but it is likely to have been between fourteen and sixteen. 39. He has been smoking cannabis since the age of twelve. He smokes ten cones daily. That level for such a long period must be potentially dangerous. When in the community, he daily consumes alcohol, I suspect most frequently to a point of inebriation. He went to a full-time drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre as part of his bail conditions on one occasion but he says there were no drug and alcohol programmes being conducted there so he left. I note there are no drug and alcohol programmes offered for him at Broken Hill Correctional Centre. It seems management has been unable, or more likely unwilling, to fill a vacancy allocated to the Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Services.Character and Criminal History40. Archie Shepherd is a fit young Aboriginal man with serious attitudinal and probably mental health issues. He has been raised in an environment of alcohol and drug related violence both social and domestic. Indeed he described in evidence the difference between Wilcannia and Sydney by noting “They don’t fight in the streets in Sydney”. He had been in and out of gaol during his adult life. On the four occasions he has been in thus far, he has already clocked up more than two and a half years. He seems to have difficulty both in the community and in gaol. Since 2004, he has thirteen disciplinary charges including fighting, intimidation, damaging property and throwing articles, all expressions of anger. As a minor he was charged with being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence and common assault, breaking and entering buildings, car related offending, robbery armed with offensive weapon, further breaking and entering, intimidating police, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and malicious damage. As an adult there are break and enters, malicious damage, common assaults.Attitude to Offence41. He has expressed regret for his offending. He told the court he was very sorry for what he had done. I am satisfied he is deeply troubled by the fact that he is getting into trouble and unable to interact with others without problems. Indeed during the course of his evidence his mood swung from one of open and forthright cooperation and frankness to one of sullen, smouldering anger. In fairness I note there were no outbursts but he returned to the dock in a far more sour mood than when he came from the dock to the witness box. There was nothing aggressive, unfair or harassing about the Crown’s cross-examination that provided any explanation to me, it was simply something that had happened that obviously upset him. In such a person, true insight and meaningfully and personally directed contrition is hard to find. But I do accept that he is certainly troubled by the way things have gone.Plea42. This matter was listed for trial at this sittings. There had already been a trial re the issues although it had not yet reached the jury but not in respect of the charge that Mr Shepherd was arraigned on before me. When offered the recklessly wound charge, he pleaded at the first opportunity. Even so, a jury was summoned for the trial and had to be discharged by the court. The utilitarian value of this plea is therefore compromised, nonetheless there was a value in it and I intend to give a twelve and a half per cent discount on any sentence I otherwise would have set.Rehabilitation Prospects43. Mr Shepherd’s rehabilitation prospects are bleak. I am sad to say. I would assess the likelihood of further offending as high. He has no support within the community and appears to have a capacity to alienate any support he might be likely to receive. He has been raised in the fields of violence, has been damaged by death of persons of importance to him, his recent and remote pasts are sign posted by offences of violence and dishonesty. He abuses drugs and alcohol.Setting the Sentence44. The nature of this offence, that is domestic violence, and his recent past offending, call for weight to be given to general and personal deterrence.Standard Non-Parole Period45. I have assessed the objective criminality as marginally below the mid-range of seriousness. While the offender’s subjective circumstances give some insight into the dynamics of his past life and its subsequent impact upon his behaviour, they do not drive the objective seriousness any higher. This is a case in which the standard non-parole period will not apply. Having said that, I acknowledge that it still has work to do in that it indicates the legislature wants matters such as these dealt with more severely than in the past.Totality46. During the period since his arrest he has served a sentence of five months. But for that sentence, the remainder of his time has been related only to this offence. The Crown submitted, and on reflection I have decided to accept, that an appropriate period of accumulation of that five months sentence is two of those five months.Special Circumstances47. It is appropriate to find special circumstances. This is a case which attracts the principles enunciated in R v Stanley Edward Fernando (1992) 76 A.Crim.R. 58. In particular I note the following:  
     
      
      (a) The same sentencing principles are to be applied in every case regardless of the identity of the particular offender or his membership of an ethnic or other group. But that does not mean that the sentencing court ignores those facts which exist only by reason of the offender’s membership of the Aboriginal community. 
       
      (b) The relevance of Aboriginality is not necessarily to mitigate punishment but to explain or throw light on the offence and the circumstances of the offender. Hopefully I have given proper attention to both. 
       
      (c) Problems of alcohol abuse and violence go hand in hand with Aboriginal communities and their cure requires more subtle remedies than the criminal law can provide by way of imprisonment. 
       
      (d) The court must be careful in pursuit of sentencing policies not to deprive other Aborigines of the protection which it is assumed punishment provides. 
       
      (e) In sentencing persons of Aboriginal descent, the court must avoid any hint of racism, paternalism or collective guilt, but assess realistically the objective seriousness of the crime within the local setting and by reference to the particular subjective circumstances in this case of Archie Shepherd. 
       
      (f) In sentencing an Aborigine who has come from a deprived background or otherwise disadvantaged by reason or social or economic factors, a lengthy term of imprisonment may be particularly, even unduly harsh when served in an environment which is foreign to him and dominated by inmates and prison officers of European background.  
      
    48. Since those remarks were made by Wood J, more attention in the custodial system has been given to the housing of Aboriginal inmates. Broken Hill, although it is deprived in many ways of resources, it seems to me, at least has a predominance of other Aboriginal men and women within the confines of the prison walls. Wellington and Yetta Dhinnakkal are two other prisons, and I think Tamworth as well, are prisons that have large Aboriginal inmate populations. 
     
      
      (g) It is important to ensure that the punishment fits the crime and not lose sight of the objective seriousness of the offence but  
      full weight must be given to the competing public interests to rehabilitation of the offender and the avoidance of recidivism on his part 
      .  
      
    49. The way in which Wood J approached that problem in Fernando is instructive. His Honour resolved the competing tensions by giving, in Fernando's case, a head sentence of four and a half years with a non-parole of nine months. That mechanism in today’s sentencing regime would require a finding of special circumstances and I intend to do so.50. Mr Shepherd would you stand up please.51. Archie Shepherd, I convict you of the offence that you between 29 October 2008 and 4 November 2008 at Broken Hill in the State of New South Wales recklessly wounded Twylla Dutton. For that offence but for your plea of guilty I would have set an overall sentence of three and a half years. I have reduced that sentence to three years and one month, that is taking five months off it which is twelve and a half per cent as near as I can go. I sentence you to a non-parole period of eighteen months to date from 11 January 2009 and to expire on 10 July 2010 and a balance of term of nineteen months which goes to 10 February 2012. In respect of the s 166 matters, sequence 2, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, leave is given to the Crown to withdraw that. In respect of the sequence 3, contravene apprehended domestic violence order, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six months to date from 11 January 2009 and to expire on 10 July 2009.HIS HONOUR: Mr Shepherd because you have been sentenced to a sentence of imprisonment of more than three years, I cannot order your parole. You will have to persuade the Parole board that you are a suitable candidate to be released to parole. That will include persuading them that you have accommodation and persuading them that there is no danger to the community or to yourself when you are released. Do you understand that?OFFENDER: Yes.SIMPSON: There should be an automatic non-association order as well your Honour for the period of the sentence so that should expire January 2012.HIS HONOUR: Apprehended personal violence order--SIMPSON: Under section 39 your Honour.HIS HONOUR: There will issue an apprehended personal violence order, with the protected person being Twylla Dutton, in terms of 1 and 2 and to not to approach Twylla Dutton directly or indirectly for a period expiring on 10 February 2012.

    2 GROVE J: I agree with R A Hulme J 
     
      
    3 R A HULME J: Garry Anthony Smale (“the applicant’) was sentenced by his Honour Judge Graham (“the judge”) in the District Court on 9 September 2005 for four offences to a total term of 7 years with a non-parole component of 5 years. 4 For an offence of break, enter and steal (s 112(1) Crimes Act 1900 – maximum penalty imprisonment for 14 years) there was a sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years. For an offence of specially aggravated break, enter and steal (s 112(3) – 25 years) there was a sentence of imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. For an offence of assault (s 61 – 2 years) there was a fixed term of imprisonment for 1 year and for an offence of larceny (s 117/s 154A – 5 years) there was a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years. All of the sentences were specified to commence on 18 September 2012 which is three years before the expiration of a non-parole period specified in respect of a pre-existing sentence. Accordingly the effect of the sentencing orders made by the judge was to extend the minimum time the applicant will be in custody by two years.5 In sentencing the applicant for the specially aggravated break and enter offence the judge also took into account the applicant’s guilt in respect of 8 further offences listed on two Form 1 documents pursuant to s 33 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.6 A notice of application for leave to appeal was filed on the applicant’s behalf on 15 April 2009, an extension of time having earlier being granted. The proposed appeal is concerned only with the sentence imposed for the offence against s 112(3) for understandable reasons.Facts7 The offence of break, enter and steal was committed on 12 August 2001. The applicant was seen entering a property in Lloyd Street, Sans Souci at around 4.00pm. He gained entry through a man-hole in the roof of the verandah and stole a quantity of jewellery from inside the house. A person who witnessed the entry approached the front door and knocked. The applicant decamped after breaking a window at the rear of the house. He ran towards the street and in doing so came into contact with the witness. A scuffle ensued (Form 1 – assault). Police arrived and were involved in a further scuffle with the applicant as they endeavoured to arrest him (Form 1 – resist police officer in execution of duty). The applicant had earlier been seen to be driving a motor vehicle in Lloyd Street that had been stolen from Ashfield a fortnight earlier (Form 1 – drive conveyance without consent). The vehicle had false/stolen number plates affixed to it (Form 1 – driver display unauthorised number plate). 8 There was a dispute as to certain facts relating to the offence of specially aggravated break, enter and steal which was committed on 17 September 2001. As it is an issue on this application it is best to quote from the judge’s sentencing remarks. 
     
      
       
        
        “The episode on 17 September also involved violence. That involved a break-in at a community centre in Marrickville. There was a confrontation between the offender and the sixty-three year old maintenance man at the community centre. At about 8.30am, he found the offender standing at a desk holding a pinch bar in his left hand and a plastic bag in his right hand. There is a dispute in the evidence, and having regard to the absence of any cross-examination specifically directed to the offender’s version of events, with some reluctance, the court must proceed to sentence on the basis that the offender’s version ought to be accepted for the purpose of sentencing. According to the offender, both men left the office and, in the course of it, the offender tripped on a tree root and was then confronted by his victim. In the course of fending him off, he struck out with the pinch bar, which happened to be in his hand. As I have said, that version is accepted with some reluctance, having regard to the statement of the complainant, which gives a significantly different version of the events, and, indeed, having regard to the significant corroboration available in the statement of the victim of the assault which took place shortly afterwards, that victim herself having seen an incident described in very similar terms to those described by the male victim of the specially aggravated breaking and entering. That offence alleges that the special aggravation was the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm. The version given by the offender is, at least, consistent with a reckless act on his part, and indeed is sufficient, in my view, to treat it as an intentional form of malice. In any event, the victim sustained two broken bones in his left wrist. His wound required stitching and the fractures required plastering. 
         
         
        The next phase of that episode involved a confrontation with a woman who was working at the centre and a demand for the car keys. This demand was accompanied by the swinging of the crowbar towards her head. She held out the keys. The offender ran to her vehicle and drove it out of the car park and to a position outside the main office, where he opened the doors, went into the office and wheeled out a chair with a safe on it and put that safe into the vehicle. A witness then ran towards the vehicle, at which time the offender accelerated away. The safe contained about $530 in Australian currency and cheque books and various cheques. That episode concludes, in terms of the principal offences before the court, with an offence of larceny of a motor vehicle, that being the vehicle of the assault victim.” 
        
       
      
    9 Apart from the offences committed in conjunction with the break, enter and steal offence of 12 August 2001 there were four further offences listed on the Form 1 documents. There was an offence of break, enter and steal committed on 16 August 2001 at Arncliffe when the applicant broke into the home of an eighty year old woman and stole a quantity of jewellery including a wedding ring. When the owner returned home she saw him leave through a rear window and enter a stolen car and drive off, the latter being an offence of driving a conveyance taken without the owner’s consent. There was a further offence of break, enter and steal committed on 17 September 2001 at St Peters when property to the value of about $2,500 was taken. When the applicant was arrested the following day he was found to be in possession of housebreaking implements.10 The offences committed by the applicant in August 2001 were at a time when he was the subject of a suspended sentence bond. In addition to that bond, the offences in September 2001 where also committed whilst he was on bail for the August matters. Related events11 It is necessary to set out the detail of some other events in order to understand some aspects of the sentences imposed by the judge, including the dates of commencement, and also to set the background for two of the proposed grounds of appeal.12 On the 16 March 2001 the applicant received a two year sentence of imprisonment which was suspended upon him entering into a bond pursuant to s12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for an offence of supplying a prohibited drug for financial reward. He was found to be in breach of that bond and was dealt with in the District Court in respect of that on 11 October 2001. The order suspending execution of the sentence was revoked and the sentence was activated. The sentence was specified to commence on 18 September 2001 with the non-parole period of 18 months expiring on 17 March 2003.13 At some stage following his arrest on 18 September 2001 the applicant was charged with offences of murder and robbery in company whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. Those offences occurred on 19 July 2001. He pleaded guilty to the robbery but went to trial in respect of the murder. A jury returned a verdict of guilty. On 26 August 2005, Patten AJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 18 years with a non-parole period of 13 years and 6 months. He specified that the sentence was to commence on 18 March 2002, that is six months after the sentence for the drug supply offence had commenced.14 Although the applicant had pleaded guilty to the offences with which this application is concerned in July and September 2002, the matter did not proceed to sentence until September 2005, that is after the matters of murder and robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon had been finalised in the Supreme Court.Subjective features15 The applicant was born in 1958 and so he was aged 44 at the time of the offences and 47 at the time he stood for sentence.16 The judge noted that he has a “very substantial criminal history” which started in the Children’s Court when he was aged 13. The judge noted, however, that apart from the period of offending in July to September 2001, the previous history of criminality was notably free of any significant offences of violence. He noted that the majority of the history related to property crime. The applicant has a history of drug use and many of his previous offences were related to his long standing and very serious drug habit. The applicant told the judge in his evidence that in 2001 he was using heroin and cocaine on a daily basis. He claimed that since going into custody he had undertaken counselling as well as drug and alcohol courses. 17 The applicant also expressed regret and remorse for his actions during the course of his evidence. He was cross-examined by the representative of the Crown on this subject and specifically as to how he felt at the time of committing the offences. His explanation, in effect, was that when he was withdrawing from drugs he would think of little else other than obtaining the wherewithal to procure more drugs, but afterwards he would reflect on his actions and feel regret.18 It is obvious from the remarks on sentence that the judge paid close attention to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. That was a difficult issue given that the applicant was not due for release until a little over ten years hence. The judge referred to the applicant’s evidence that despite a lifetime of criminality he had changed his outlook, particularly as a result of his involvement in the Supreme Court matters. The judge noted that the applicant’s culpability for the murder was on an extended joint criminal enterprise basis. However, he then went on to remark: 
     
      
       
        
        “His conduct in July, August and September of 2001 revealed a significant escalation in the nature of his criminality, more particularly in relation to the intrusion into it of a significant element of violence. That was apparent in the offences committed on 12 August, when he assaulted the neighbour who came to investigate, and the offences of 17 September 2001, where there was a serious assault on the maintenance man and the offence of common assault on the female owner of the vehicle which he used as a getaway vehicle. Obviously, the violence for which he became legally responsible in the course of the armed robbery and the armed robbery itself indicate an escalation of his criminality.” 
        
       
      
    19 The judge then proceeded to note that the applicant had sought to take steps while in custody to do what could be done by way of courses and becoming involved in a more structured program. Noting that the offences in 2001 had the common theme of being related to the need to fund his drug addiction and also perhaps by the common theme of having a state of mind affected by the urgent desire to get the wherewithal to buy or obtain further drugs the judge went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “Clearly if he is able to maintain his present attitude of overcoming that addiction, then, whilst his prospects of rehabilitation would not be regarded as exceptionally good, having regard to the entrenched history of criminality, nonetheless, given the age at which he would be released from custody and given that resolve, then the prospects of rehabilitation would be markedly better than might have been the case at the time of the commission of the offences four years ago.” 
        
       
      
    Proposed grounds of appeal20 Four grounds of appeal were notified: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The sentencing judge failed to properly take into account the fact that the effective period on parole resulting from the sentences was only 2 years 6 months, in a total effective sentence of 18 years and 6 months. 
         
         
        2. In all the circumstances the fact that the effective period on parole resulting from the sentences was only 2 years and 6 months, in a total effective sentence of 18 years and 6 months, amounted to an error of law. 
         
         
        3. The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
         
         
        4. The applicant was sentenced on the basis that the grievous bodily harm in the offence of specially aggravated breaking and entering had been intentionally inflicted, rather than recklessly. Having accepted the applicant’s evidence on this aspect of the matter, and not having rejected it beyond a reasonable doubt, this finding of fact was not open to his Honour. 
        
       
      
    Submissions in relation to grounds 1 and 221 In written submissions counsel for the applicant, who was not counsel who appeared at the hearing of the application, made the point that by the combination of the revoked suspended sentence, the murder and associated armed robbery sentence, and the sentences imposed in these proceedings, the applicant was serving a total effective sentence of 18 years 6 months commencing on 18 September 2001 and concluding on 17 March 2020. There was an effective non-parole period of 16 years concluding on 17 September 2017. Thus, the non-parole period amounted to 86.49% of the total effective sentence. Reference was made to a portion of the judge’s remarks on the subject of special circumstances: 
     
      
       
        
        “There are some special circumstances; the extent to which this sentence is accumulated will be one of them, and the extent of the accumulation will affect the weight of that special circumstance. The other is clearly that there will be a significant period of time required for the supervision of this offender. The way in which the sentence will be structured will, however, appropriately provide a sufficient period for that purpose. In fixing a non-parole period, I am conscious of the special circumstances but their weight, it seems to me, would not need to be as great as would be the case should the ultimate decision be to fully accumulate that sentence on the expiration of the non-parole period on the murder charge.” 
        
       
      
    22 It was submitted that the judge did not achieve his stated purpose of properly taking into account “the extent to which this sentence will be accumulated” by virtue of the fact that the parole period was only 2 years and 6 months in a total sentence of 18 years 6 months. Such a parole period, it was submitted, was relatively short and inadequate for supervision on parole and assistance with reintegration into the community, particularly where the judge was of the opinion that “a significant period of time (would be) required for the supervision of this offender.”23 Reference was made to a number of cases in which a parole period was held to be inadequate in the context of the overall sentence imposed. In Salvaggio v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 136 the total effective sentence was one of 4 years with the non-parole component being 3 years 6 months. The sentencing judge provided no explanation as to why the parole period was so relatively short. Smart AJ remarked that a period of supervision longer than 6 months would have been beneficial in assisting the applicant to re-establish himself in the community. The appeal, however, was dismissed. 24 In Morris, Morris and Snelson v R [2008] NSWCCA 182 the total effective sentence for one of the applicants was also one of 4 years with a non-parole component of 3 years 6 months. The sentencing judge had stated an intention to find special circumstances. Hidden J remarked that the fact of accumulation of sentences was itself a special circumstance. The Crown conceded the point and the applicant was re-sentenced.25 In Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 14 a judge accumulated a sentence upon a pre-existing sentence so that the overall result was a total term of 12 years with a non-parole component of 10 years. Howie J said that the parole period was out of proportion to the non-parole period and that it was erroneous for the sentencing judge to have failed to consider whether the accumulation amounted to special circumstances. Nevertheless, I note, the court intervened only to the extent necessary to correct a technical error and not to change the structure of the sentence, Howie J remarking that the seriousness of the offences warranted a non-parole period of at least 10 years.26 The Crown submitted that the judge was careful to consider the question of whether there were special circumstances, the principle of totality and the impact of the decision he was making to partially accumulate the sentence he was imposing upon the pre-existing sentence. Reference was made to other cases involving sentencing for multiple offences where the proportion of the overall sentence represented by the non-parole component exceeded seventy-five percent and in which this Court declined to intervene. Reliance was placed on authorities relating to the fixing of non-parole periods such as R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 in which Spigelman CJ stated: 
     
      
       
        
        [34] … Perhaps more significantly, it must also always be taken into account that the non-parole period is a minimum period which the convicted person must, in fact, serve. In formulating the non-parole period questions of general deterrence and similar considerations arising from the gravity of the offence may determine that the minimum period should not fall below a stipulated amount, even despite the need for extended supervision on parole. 
        
       
      
    Consideration of grounds 1 and 227 The judge was faced with something of a dilemma in formulating the appropriate sentence to impose upon the applicant and determining how it should be moulded, to use his expression, into the existing sentence. The combination of the two pre-existing sentences involved a total term of 18 years 6 months with a non-parole component of 14 years. Having first identified a sentence of imprisonment for 7 years as appropriate (as required by Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610), his Honour was then faced with the discretionary decision as to whether to order that it be served entirely concurrently, entirely consecutively, or partially concurrent and partially consecutive with the pre-existing non-parole period: s 55 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Complete concurrence would have failed to impose any effective punishment upon the applicant for a discrete and most serious offence (together with the offences taken into account) and, having regard to the totality principle, the judge was clearly of the view that complete accumulation was not warranted. 28 There is abundant authority in this Court as to how a sentencing judge should approach the making of this discretionary judgement. In Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41, Howie J summarised the relevant principles thus: 
     
      
       
        
        [27] In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both. 
        
       
      
    29 In setting the non-parole period for the sentence the judge clearly had in mind the need for parole supervision of the applicant upon release and the effect that the partial accumulation of the sentence would have upon the potential parole period. The circumstances were such that there was limited scope to provide for what would ordinarily be desirable in this respect. It must be borne in mind as well that 2 years 6 months is not an insignificant period of time. Senior counsel for the applicant was at a loss to suggest some alternative course that could have been taken by the judge. In my view, giving greater effect to a finding of special circumstances would have resulted in setting a non-parole period that failed adequately to reflect the criminality involved in the offence. This has been described as the “ultimate constraint” in setting the length of a non-parole period: per Spigelman CJ in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [63]. 30 I would reject grounds 1 and 2.31 There is an important observation to make before departing these grounds. There was no explanation provided for why the sentencing of the applicant was delayed for as long as it was. The pleas of guilty were entered, as I have said, in July and September 2002 but finalisation of the sentence proceedings was deferred until September 2005. I can only assume that it was thought necessary or appropriate to await the outcome of the proceedings on the murder and armed robbery charges in the Supreme Court. This is something that I have encountered in the past when an offender has proceedings in two different jurisdictions and it has been sought to defer finalisation of the less serious charge(s) until he or she is sentenced for the more serious charge(s). The present case demonstrates that this can serve to constrain the court dealing with what are usually less serious charges from imposing an appropriate sentence, or, as in this case, providing for a desirable period of parole. If the court sentencing second is the Local Court, there are statutory constraints upon the scope to accumulate sentences (s 58 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act).  
     
      
    Submissions in relation to ground 432 It is convenient next to deal with ground 4 which asserts that the judge erred by sentencing the applicant upon the basis that he intentionally, rather than recklessly, inflicted grievous bodily harm during the course of his confrontation with the maintenance man at the community centre. This contention centres upon the passage of the judge’s remarks in which he indicated that, albeit with his stated reluctance, he would assess the sentence upon the basis of the applicant’s version of events. In that context he said: 
     
      
       
        
        The version given by the offender is, at least, consistent with a reckless act on his part, and indeed is sufficient, in my view, to treat it as an intentional form of malice. 
        
       
      
    33 Senior counsel for the applicant drew attention to the distinction between the version of the victim, which he submitted described an “aggressive attack”, and the version of the applicant, which he submitted described a “fending off” without an intention to inflict harm. It was contended that by sentencing upon the basis that the harm was inflicted intentionally the judge must have regarded the offence as more serious than if he had regarded the harm as having been inflicted recklessly and that this was not something that was open to the judge to do because of his acceptance of the version of the applicant.34 The Crown submitted that it was not incumbent upon the judge to accept the applicant’s version given in his evidence which was markedly different to the version set out in the statement of facts and the statements of the victim and the eye-witness which were each tendered without objection. The Crown contended this was so notwithstanding the absence of cross-examination on the topic by the representative of the Crown. Reliance was placed upon the following in the judgment of Howie J said in R v Falls [2004] NSWCCA 335: 
     
      
       
        
        [34] In my opinion, the failure of the Crown to cross-examine the offender on a particular aspect of his or her evidence or to make submissions to the sentencing judge about that evidence does not mean that the sentencer is bound to accept the evidence. I do not believe that the tribunal of fact can be restricted by the conduct of the parties in that way: certainly not in sentencing proceedings which do not have the same formality or rigidity in procedure as, say, a criminal trial. It is for the tribunal of fact to weigh the evidence of the offender and determine whether to accept it to the required standard:  
        R v O’Neill 
         (1979) 2 NSWLR 582 at 597. That is so even where the Crown does not call witnesses but relies upon depositions or formal statements:  
        R v Blanchard 
         (NSWCCA, 10 September 1991, unreported). It seems to me that it must be so where there is tendered what purports to be an agreed statement of facts.  
         
         
        [35] The touchstone in the finding of facts by a sentencer is, of course, fairness to both parties. I see nothing unfair to an offender in the refusal of a sentencer to act upon his or her evidence, even if the evidence is undisputed by the Crown, at least where the offender has the onus of proof because it is a matter of extenuation or mitigation. Fairness may require that the sentencer indicate that he or she is not prepared to act upon the evidence in order to permit counsel to address on it or to lead further evidence to support it. Fairness may also mean that the Crown cannot seek to challenge the finding of the sentencer, for example on a Crown appeal, where that finding was not disputed at the hearing. 
        
       
      
    35 The Crown submitted that the judge, in accepting the version of the applicant, proceeded in a manner that was “unduly favourable” to him.Consideration of ground 436 Whilst it may have been open to the judge to reject the version of the applicant, the fact of the matter is that, rightly or wrongly, he decided to assess the appropriate sentence based upon that version. The question appears to me to be whether he was correct in regarding that version as a basis to conclude that the applicant acted intentionally, as opposed to recklessly, in the infliction of harm upon the victim. I would answer that question in the affirmative. Acting upon the applicant’s version of the incident the judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the course of fending him off, he  
        struck out 
         with the pinch bar, which happened to be in his hand”. (Emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    37 The judge expressed the view that this was “at least” consistent with a reckless act but immediately proceeded to state that it was sufficient, in his view, to “treat it as an intentional form of malice”. That was a finding that was open to him on the evidence. I would reject ground 4.Submissions in relation to ground 338 Rejection of ground 4 takes away part of the principal argument advanced on the applicant’s behalf on this ground alleging manifest excess. The Court was, however, also taken to sentencing statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission, both those that were provided to the judge and more recent statistics filed with the written submissions. It was submitted that the latter statistics demonstrated that the sentence imposed upon the applicant, “although not at the top of the range, was quite severe”. 39 Counsel conceded that the severity of the sentence could be partly explained by the fact that the offence was committed whilst the applicant was in the community under two forms of conditional liberty, bail and a suspended sentence bond, and also by the fact that further offences on the Form 1 documents were taken into account. 40 The Crown submitted that far from being manifestly excessive, the sentence imposed for the specially aggravated break and enter offence was “somewhat lenient”. Reference was made to a mistake made by the judge as to the maximum penalty, he having said that it was imprisonment for 20 years rather than 25 years. I note, however that this was a result of being misinformed by the representative of the Crown. It was also submitted that the decision to order that all of the sentences have the one commencement date was “a particularly lenient approach” having regard to the fact that they were each for separate and serious offences. Then there was the need to impose a longer sentence because the judge was required to take into account eight further offences on the Form 1 documents involving different episodes of criminality, including two unrelated offences of break, enter and steal. Finally, reference was made to the conditional liberty status of the applicant when the offences were committed.Consideration of ground 341 The statistics that were before the judge were based upon 36 cases in which 31% involved a longer sentence and 58% a shorter sentence. The statistics filed with the written submissions were based upon 21 cases in which there had been a plea of guilty finalised in the period January 2001 to December 2007. In 24% of those cases there was a longer sentence and 58% a shorter sentence. The use of statistics in this context is something that must be approached with caution: Regina v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734. Those upon which the applicant relies do not take account of the features of the present case that militated in favour of a more severe sentence – the Form 1 offences and the applicant’s conditional liberty status. I do not regard the statistical material relied upon by the applicant as providing any support for the proposition that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 42 In my view, the sentence imposed by the judge was well within the range of the sound sentencing discretion. I would reject ground 3.Orders43 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
        
        1 Leave to appeal is granted 
         
         
        2 The appeal is dismissed.

   1 On 7 September 2009, the accused filed an election to be tried by judge alone to which the Director of Public Prosecutions had consented. I was satisfied that, before he made the election, the accused had sought and received advice from a legal practitioner.2 On 8 September 2009, the accused was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the charge that, on 10 September 2008 at Woollamia, he supplied the prohibited drug cannabis leaf (particularised as 9708.5g).General Directions3 The Crown has the task of proving the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The Crown does not have to prove the truth of each statement of each Crown witness. What the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt is each legal element of the charge. If I have a reasonable doubt in relation to whether the Crown has proved any element that it is required to prove, I must return a verdict of not guilty. In this trial, the Crown case is one of ""deemed supply"". Consequently, if the Crown proves the legal elements that it is required to prove, including possession of the prohibited drug, the onus shifts to the accused to prove on the balance of probabilities that he possessed the drug for a purpose other than supply.4 In making findings of fact, I must rely upon the evidence, i.e. the evidence given by the witnesses and the evidence contained in the exhibits. I must apply my common sense.5 As a matter of practical reality, in this trial the issues are: first, whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused possessed the cannabis leaf in the old bus on his property (in effect, whether he intentionally exercised exclusive control over it); and, second, whether I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused possessed cannabis leaf for a purpose other than supply.6 The accused gave evidence on oath. He was not obliged to do that. It is not for an accused to prove his innocence but for the Crown to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The accused could have said nothing but he chose to give evidence and subject himself to cross-examination. That does not mean that his evidence was necessarily true. In assessing the reliability of the accused’s evidence, I adopt the approach applicable to assessing the reliability of any witness.7 The accused is 62 years old. The Crown conceded that the only matters recorded against the accused are traffic matters and the last traffic offence occurred in 1992. The evidence of good character is to be taken into account in relation both to the accused’s guilt and to his credibility as a witness. The fact that the accused is a person of prior good character is to be considered both when determining whether the accused conducted himself in the manner alleged and when determining the reliability of his evidence.Elements of the Offence8 At law, the meaning of ""supply"" is broader than its ordinary meaning. Inter alia, a person ""supplies"" a drug if he/ she has the drug in his/ her possession for the purpose of supply. 9 Parliament foresaw the potential difficulty in proving that a person is in possession of a drug for the purpose of supply, so it introduced the concept of the ""deemed supply"" of a drug. A person who has in his/her possession an amount of a prohibited drug that is not less than the ""trafficable quantity"" applicable to that drug is deemed to have the drug in his/her possession for the purpose of supply, subject to a defence to which I will refer. The ""trafficable quantity"" is a quantity set by the Parliament. It differs for different prohibited drugs.10 Where, as in this trial, the Crown relies on the deeming provision to prove possession for supply, the Crown must prove three legal elements beyond reasonable doubt.(1). The substance was a prohibited drug. Cannabis leaf is a prohibited drug. (2). The accused was in possession of the drug. A person possesses a drug if, at the relevant time, he/she intentionally has exclusive physical control of the drug, or has the ability to control it to the exclusion of others. ""Intentional"" possession means that the possessor knows that he/she possesses the substance and intends to possess it. The possessor must know of the presence or likely presence of the substance. He/she must know that the relevant substance is or might well be a prohibited drug. It is the accused's actual knowledge or belief that must be proved, not what a reasonable person would have known or believed. Knowledge of a thing and intention to control it may be inferred from the circumstances. (3). The drug weighed not less than the trafficable quantity applicable to that drug. The ""trafficable quantity"" of cannabis leaf is 300g. It is not necessary that 100% of a substance is a prohibited drug. It is only necessary that a prohibited drug forms part of the mixture.11 If the Crown proves each of these legal elements beyond reasonable doubt, then the onus shifts to the accused to prove on the balance of probabilities - that it is more likely than not - that he possessed the drug other than for supply.The Crown Case12 On 10 September 2008, police executed a search warrant at a property at Woollamia. The accused resided alone at the property. He had owned the property since the 1980s. The property was just under 10 acres in size. At the beginning of the search, the accused was cautioned. During the search, the accused conversed with police. Police seized vegetable matter and other items from a bathroom/laundry area and other parts of the residence. They found $20,845 in a safe within the residence. They seized a firearm, ammunition and a crossbow from the residence. These items are the subject of charges to which the accused has pleaded guilty. 13 After leaving the residence, police searched a caravan, where they seized further vegetable material and other items. They went to a shed that contained a growing area. They seized plants from inside the shed and from a garden just outside the shed. The plants are the subject of a cultivation charge to which the accused has pleaded guilty. Police then seized more vegetable material from an old bus located in dense undergrowth. 14 Exhibit A, an analyst's certificate under section 43 of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985, provides evidence that all the vegetable material that was seized by police was cannabis leaf and that the total quantity was 9708 g. Some of the cannabis leaf was ""head"", a more potent and valuable part of the drug that - according to the officer in charge - typically retails for about $4000 per kilo. The remaining drug was ""leaf"". ""Leaf"" commonly retails for about $2000 per kilo. Of the total quantity of 9708 g, 373 g was found in the house (345 g of ""head"" and 28 g of ""leaf""), 3010 g was found in the caravan (625 g of ""head"" and 2385 g of ""leaf""), and 6326 g was found in the bus (483 g of ""head"" and 5843 g of ""leaf"").15 On the basis of the analyst's certificate, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the vegetable matter that was seized by police was cannabis leaf and that the total quantity exceeded the ""trafficable quantity"" for cannabis leaf. The accused did not argue to the contrary.16 The accused denied any knowledge of the cannabis leaf found in the bus. He conceded that he knew about the other cannabis leaf. The other cannabis leaf was located on property that the accused owned and in relation to which he was the sole occupant, I find beyond reasonable doubt that he ""possessed"" the other cannabis leaf in that he intentionally exercised exclusive physical control over it.17 Despite the accused's prior good character, I reject his evidence that he knew nothing about the cannabis in the old bus and, based on the following circumstances, I conclude that the only rational inference is that the accused knew that there was vegetable matter in the bus, knew that the vegetable matter was cannabis leaf and intentionally exercised exclusive control over that cannabis leaf.(1). The cannabis leaf in the bus was not the only cannabis that was stored away from the house. As the Crown submitted, ""there was cannabis everywhere on the property"". The accused was well aware of the cannabis leaf elsewhere on the property. (2). The accused resided alone on the property. The property was only 10 acres in size. The accused had owned the property for a long time and had resided on the property for a significant period of time. (3). Although the bus was situated in dense scrub, there was a ""fairly well worn"" bush track to the bus and the bus was quite close to the house (Exhibit C, page 82).(4). There was a large quantity of cannabis leaf in the bus. It had been there for a considerable time. Although it was of poor quality, according to the officer in charge, it was saleable. It is most unlikely that someone other than the accused would have abandoned a valuable item on the accused's property.(5). When the officer in charge informed the accused that police had seen the bus and intended to search it, the accused responded ""oh, shit"", suggesting concern about the outcome of the search (Exhibit C, page 80).18 In relation to all the cannabis leaf found on the property, the Crown has established each of the three legal elements beyond reasonable doubt.The Case for the Accused19 The accused gave evidence that he had intended to smoke the cannabis ""head"" found in the bathroom that became Exhibit A items 1.2 and 1.3.1. As to the remainder of the cannabis in the residence and caravan, he said that it was discarded ""rubbish"", much of which he had intended to burn.20 On the balance of probabilities, I am prepared to accept that the accused intended to make personal use of items 1.2 and 1.3.1 (a total quantity of 207 g). At the outset, the accused told police that it was for personal use. He has consistently maintained that, in the period preceding the offence, he used small quantities of cannabis to relieve arthritic pain. He told police that he used a small quantity every day or every second day (Exhibit C). In evidence, he referred to using a gram or two grams per session, but said that he did not use cannabis every day. He agreed that he may have used a bit less or a bit more than 365 g a year.21 On the balance of probabilities, as to the cannabis in the bus I find that it may well have been permanently discarded. At least, as at 10 September 2008, the accused had no intention to supply it and did not possess it for that purpose. By all accounts, the cannabis was relatively old and of low quality. It was not stored in a manner that would protect its value. Most of the cannabis was stored in open plastic shopping bags. During the search, an officer remarked of the ""head"" in the bus that it looked as though it had been there for a long time (Exhibit C page 81). The bus had no door and was open to the elements. Unlike the caravan, the bus was not locked or secured in any way. There was a rat's nest in the bus and an old paper (2004), suggesting a lack of recent human activity in the bus (Exhibit C page 81).22 However, I do not accept the accused's assertion that the other cannabis found in the house and the cannabis in the caravan was ""rubbish"" which he had no intention of supplying and which, generally speaking, was not fit for consumption.23 In assessing the accused's credibility, I take into account his prior good character. Nevertheless, I find that he was not a credible witness.(1). For the reasons stated above, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he lied when he said that he knew nothing of the cannabis in the old bus.(2). The accused maintained that the crop in the shed was a poor crop which had largely been eaten by rabbits. However, the DVD of the search and the photographs in Exhibit E show apparently healthy plants. If the crop was useless then the accused would not have bothered maintaining it, and would not have kept it under lock and key. (3). The accused's explanation of the sum of $20,845 is not believable. In effect, he said that, despite having a bank account, he had kept the cash for 10 or 12 years (during which time the money had earned no interest) because it was convenient to have ready cash. It is true that some of the cash may have been in the safe for a long time (it was held by elastic bands that had perished) and that the evidence does not support the existence of a thriving cannabis business from which the accused derived a substantial income. However, I do not accept the accused's explanation about the money. Rather than being a circumstance consistent with the accused supplying drugs for profit, I treat the evidence about the money as tending to undermine the credit of the accused.(4). At the time of the search, the accused lied to the police. Initially, when he showed the police a small quantity of cannabis leaf in the bathroom which he said was for personal use, the accused assured them that he had nothing else to declare (Exhibit C, page 4). Whenever further cannabis was located, the accused dismissed it as forgotten ""rubbish"". When the police asked about the locked door at the back of the shed, the accused failed to disclose that it secured a growing area, instead stating that the door led to the back paddock (Exhibit C, pages 58 - 59). After the police discovered the cannabis leaf in the shed and before they announced that they had located and intended to search the old bus, the accused again stated that there was no further cannabis (Exhibit C, page 65).(5). The accused gave evidence of the amount of usable cannabis leaf that he had harvested from each annual crop grown between 2004 and 2007. That evidence must have been false because, had it been true, the accused would have consumed the entire harvest of each crop and, as at September 2008, he would not have possessed any cannabis leaf for personal consumption.24 The following evidence is consistent with the accused possessing part of the cannabis leaf in the house and the cannabis leaf in the caravan for the purpose of supply.(1). The caravan contained a makeshift drying rack (Exhibit E, photographs 16 and 17) and had the appearance of being used to sort and dry cannabis, consistent with an operation designed to produce a significantly greater quantity of dried cannabis leaf than that which the accused required for his modest personal needs. (2). In the caravan, police located a set of scales and a box of zip lock bags packed into a cardboard box (Exhibit E, photograph 14). The 624 g of ""head"" found in the caravan was located in 14 re-sealable plastic bags (Exhibit E, photographs 12 and 13). In the residence, police located another set of digital scales. There was cannabis residue on the scales. If cannabis was grown solely for personal consumption, there would have been no need to weigh it on digital scales. Very often, cannabis leaf that is to be supplied to others is weighed on digital scales and stored in re-sealable plastic bags. (3). Although in Exhibit C at page 45 he said that ""most (bags of leaf found in the caravan) are just harvested stem"" and that the ""head"" in the caravan was ""a tad mouldy"", in evidence the officer in charge said that the ""leaf"" found in the caravan was reasonable but not high quality, contained some ""head"" and did not appear to be exceptionally old. He rated it 6 out of 10 for quality. He said that both the ""head"" and the ""leaf"" in the caravan were reasonable street quality. ""Head"" has a typical street value of about $4000 per kilo and ""leaf"" has a typical street value of $2000 per kilo. Accepting that the cannabis in the caravan was less than average quality, the accused was nevertheless in possession of an asset worth thousands of dollars. He had a modest annual income of approximately $24,000 to 30,000, which only just met his outgoings. Common sense suggests that a person in the accused's financial circumstances would not destroy or discard such a valuable commodity on the basis that it was ""rubbish"".(4). The caravan was locked. The accused had to open it with a key. This evidence suggests that the accused valued the contents.25 In the house, the police located a vacuum sealing kit. Such an item may be used to seal bags of cannabis in order to preserve the drug. However, I place no weight on the finding of the vacuum sealing kit because such kits may be used for a variety of purposes and there is no evidence that any such kit was ever used in connection with cannabis. Similarly, in relation to the firearm and associated ammunition found in the residence, there is no basis to conclude that the accused possessed those items for the purpose of protecting his cannabis leaf rather than - as he asserted - for the purpose of killing vermin or putting down stock. As to the crossbow found at the residence, the police did not find any arrows. In relation to the scanner, there is no evidence that it was in working order. It is not illegal to possess such an item.26 I accept the submission made on behalf of the accused that the search revealed a haphazard and unsophisticated operation. There was no evidence of a large-scale ongoing and profitable business operation. A relatively small quantity of cannabis leaf had been packed into re-sealable plastic bags. In relation to the cannabis that had been packed into re-sealable plastic bags, the quantity in each bag differed and no plastic bag held a typical sale quantity such as a quarter ounce, a half-ounce or 1 ounce of cannabis leaf.27 However, the accused was an unreliable witness. Taking into account all of the evidence, I am far from satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused possessed some of the cannabis leaf in the residence and the cannabis leaf in the caravan for a purpose other than supply. Indeed, there is strong circumstantial evidence suggesting that the accused possessed that cannabis leaf for the purpose of supply, although the nature and method of such supply are unclear. 28 In relation to part of the drug found in the house and the drug found in the caravan, I return a verdict of guilty.

     HEADNOTE 
     
     
      
       
      FACTS  
       
      In April 2006 the appellant leased a mail delivery box at a newsagency, taken in a false name with other false particulars. There was communication between the appellant and a person in Venezuela. In late August of 2006 a woman in Venezuela lodged with DHL a parcel for delivery to Mrs D Jackson at the mail delivery box. This parcel contained a jewellery box which had secreted in its sides and bottom several packages of powder.  
       
       
      Employees of DHL in Venezuela became suspicious of the box, opened it and found some of the powder. The Venezuelan National Guard was notified and the powder was analysed as being a marketable quantity of cocaine. The drugs were destroyed, substituted under the House Airways Bill, and forwarded to Australia with the Australian Federal Police being informed. The AFP made a further substitution of the substance and a federal agent representing himself as a DHL officer took the parcel to the mail-box address.  
       
       
      The federal agent made several telephone contacts with the appellant. In these, the appellant used methods of communication designed to avoid identification. The appellant made attempts to distance himself from personal collection of the parcel. When these attempts failed, the appellant agreed to collect the parcel from an address belonging to Mr Anderson, a previous work colleague. When the federal agent attended the address to deliver the parcel, the appellant was not present. Anderson contacted the appellant and arranged to pick him up from a train station. When collecting the parcel, the appellant identified himself with a false name. The prisoner, as well as Anderson and his partner, were arrested.  
       
       
      The appellant was arraigned before Freeman DCJ on a single count that he “did attempt to possess a substance, being a border-controlled drug, namely cocaine, which had been unlawfully imported, and the quantity being a marketable quantity”.  
       
       
      The appellant pleaded not guilty. On 5 May 2008, the jury returned a verdict of guilty.  
       
       
      The trial judge sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for seven years and ten months, with a non-parole period of four years and ten months to commence on 5 May 2008. The trial judge had determined the appropriate penalty to be nine years with a six-year non-parole period, and adjusted this to take into account periods of pre-trial custody.  
       
       
      The appellant appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against his sentence.  
       
       
       
      ISSUES  
       
      1. Did the trial judge err in not directing a verdict of not guilty?  
       
        
       (a) Can an offence of attempting to possess a border-controlled drug which had been unlawfully imported, be committed when there has not been actual importation of a border-controlled drug?  
       (b) Does the absence of an element of the offence give rise to a defence, limitation or qualifying provision under s 11.1(6) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth)?  
       (c) Does the defence within s 307.6(5) of the Criminal Code apply when an accused believed and intended to receive a border-controlled drug, but could not know this, as it was not the fact?  
       
       
      2. Was the sentence imposed manifestly excessive?  
       
        
        (a) Does the reasoning in  
        R v Ferrer-Esis 
         (1991) 55 A Crim R 231 apply?  
        (b) Was the sentence outside the range open to the trial judge?  
        
       
       
       
      HELD 
       (Appeal against conviction dismissed; leave to appeal against sentence granted and appeal against sentence dismissed) 
       
       
      ( 
      Per Hodgson JA, McClellan CJ at CL, Howie, Hoeben and Fullerton JJ agreeing 
      )  
       
       
      1. No. 
       
        
       (a) Yes. An accused must intend each element of the relevant crime, and in pursuance of that intention do acts that are not merely preparatory but are sufficiently proximate to the intended commission of the crime. Where an element of the relevant offence is that there be a border-controlled drug that has been imported into Australia, then for there to be an attempt there must be an intention that there be such a drug that has been imported; but it is not necessary that this actually be the case. The effect of s 11.1(2), (3) and (4)(a) of the  
       Criminal Code 
        is no different from that of the general law.

          R v Mai 
           (1992) 26 NSWLR 371 approved.  
          R v Barbouttis (1995) 37 NSWLR 256 considered. 
          
         
        
       (b) No. The expressions in s 11.1(6) are apt to refer to matters extrinsic to the elements of the offence, rather than to the requirement on the prosecution to prove all the elements of the offence.  
       (c) No. Whilst s 307.6(5) is a defence within s 11.6 of the Criminal Code, it is directed to, and limited to, the situation where there is in fact a border-controlled drug that has been unlawfully imported, but the accused proves that he or she did not know this fact.  
       
       
      2. No. 
       
        
        (a) There was no error by the trial judge in giving less weight to the appellant’s youth and lack of prior convictions, having regard to the nature of the offence.  
        (b) The sentence was within the range open to the trial judge, having regard to the circumstances of the case.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 21 April 2008, the appellant was arraigned before Freeman DCJ on a single count, namely that he  
     
      
       
        
        between about 4 September 2006 and about 7 September 2006 at Sydney, New South Wales, did attempt to possess a substance, being a border-controlled drug, namely cocaine, which had been unlawfully imported, and the quantity being a marketable quantity.  
        
       
      
    2 This charge was brought pursuant to s 11.1 and s 307.6 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Code), which are as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        11.1 Attempt  
        (1) A person who attempts to commit an offence is guilty of the offence of attempting to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence attempted had been committed.  
        (2) For the person to be guilty, the person’s conduct must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence. The question whether conduct is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence is one of fact.  
        (3) For the offence of attempting to commit an offence, intention and knowledge are fault elements in relation to each physical element of the offence attempted.  
        Note: Under section 3.2, only one of the fault elements of intention or knowledge would need to be established in respect of each physical element of the offence attempted.  
        (3A) Subsection (3) has effect subject to subsection (6A).  
        (4) A person may be found guilty even if:  
         
          
         (a) committing the offence attempted is impossible; or  
         (b) the person actually committed the offence attempted.  
         
         
        (5) A person who is found guilty of attempting to commit an offence cannot be subsequently charged with the completed offence.  
        (6) Any defences, procedures, limitations or qualifying provisions that apply to an offence apply also to the offence of attempting to commit that offence.  
        (6A) Any special liability provisions that apply to an offence apply also to the offence of attempting to commit that offence.  
        (7) It is not an offence to attempt to commit an offence against section 11.2 (complicity and common purpose), section 11.5 (conspiracy to commit an offence) or section 135.4 (conspiracy to defraud).307.6 Possessing marketable quantities of unlawfully imported border controlled drugs or border controlled plants  
        (1) person commits an offence if:  
         
          
         (a) the person possesses a substance; and  
         (b) the substance was unlawfully imported; and  
         (c) the substance is a border controlled drug or border controlled plant; and  
         (d) the quantity possessed is a marketable quantity.  
         
         
        Penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years or 5,000 penalty units, or both.  
        (2) Absolute liability applies to paragraphs (1)(b) and (d).  
        (3) The fault element for paragraph (1)(c) is recklessness.  
        (4) Subsection (1) does not apply if the person proves that he or she neither intended, nor believed that another person intended, to sell any of the border controlled drug or any of the border controlled plant or its products.  
        (5) Subsection (1) does not apply if the person proves that he or she did not know that the border controlled drug or border controlled plant was unlawfully imported.  
        Note: A defendant bears a legal burden in relation to the matters in subsections (4) and (5) (see section 13.4).  
        
       
      
    3 The maximum penalty is imprisonment for twenty-five years and/or a fine not exceeding $550,000.  
     
      
    4 The appellant pleaded not guilty, and was tried before the trial judge and a jury. On 5 May 2008, the jury returned a verdict of guilty.  
     
      
    5 On 20 June 2008, the trial judge sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for seven years and ten months, with a non-parole period of four years and ten months to commence on 5 May 2008. The trial judge had determined the appropriate penalty to be nine years with a six year non-parole period, and adjusted this to take into account periods of pre-trial custody.  
     
      
    6 The appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against his sentence. For reasons I will give, in my opinion the appeal against conviction should be dismissed, and the sentence should not be disturbed.  
     
      
       
      Factual circumstances  
      
    7 The facts on the basis of which the appellant was convicted and sentenced were summarised as follows by the trial judge, in a way that has not been challenged on appeal:  
     
      
       
        
        The facts, which the jury must have found, include the following:- In April 2006 the prisoner leased a mail delivery box at the newsagency situated at 37 Rocky Point Road, Kogarah. This was a conveniently short distance from where he was then living, namely at 11 Rocky Point Road. The box was taken in a false name, with other false particulars, including an address reminiscent of but slightly different from the one at which the prisoner had previously resided.  
        There was communication, both by voice and SMS with a person in Venezuela on the part of the prisoner. There may have been email communication. In late August of 2006 a woman in Caracas Venezuela lodged with DHL a parcel for delivery to Mrs D Jackson at the mailbox namely, 16/37 Rocky Point Road, Kogarah, Australia. This parcel contained a jewellery box which had secreted in its sides and bottom several packages of powder.  
        An employee of DHL in Caracas being suspicious, for various reasons, of this parcel opened it and found some at least of those packages. The National Guard was called in, the parcel was taken for deconstruction and for its contents to be analysed. The packages contained in total an amount of 229.6 grams of powder, which was 47% pure cocaine. The weight of cocaine therefore was 107.2 grams. The marketable quantity of cocaine is 2 grams. The commercial quantity is 2 kilograms.  
        The Venezuelan authorities seized and ultimately destroyed the drug. Under the same distinctive House Airways Bill a substitute parcel was forwarded to Australia with the Australian Federal Police being informed. When that parcel was received at the DHL office in Sydney the Australian Federal Police made a further substitution and a federal agent representing himself as a DHL delivery driver took that parcel to the mail box address. There he left a notification of attempted delivery. In this notification he included a mobile phone number on which he could be contacted to arrange personal delivery. There followed a series of telephone calls from the prisoner to the agent.  
        The prisoner did not use for that purpose either of the mobile phones in his possession. Each of those phones was subscribed in a false name with false addresses. Indeed whenever he contacted the man he thought was the DHL courier the prisoner used public phones, sometimes changing from one phone to another within a relatively short period of time. The DHL courier was able to record part of the first of these calls on equipment contained within his phone. Detailed notes were made of the other calls.  
        The first few of these calls at least consisted of attempts by the prisoner to persuade the courier to leave the parcel without him, the prisoner, being present. He gave a variety of reasons as to why he desired this course of action. Ultimately, being unable to arrange for the parcel to be simply left, the prisoner gave the agent an address in Eschol Park, a suburb near Campbelltown, and a long way removed from Kogarah. That address belonged to Mr Brian Anderson.  
        Mr Anderson gave evidence that the prisoner, with whom he had worked sometime before, and with whom he retained some social contact, had asked him to allow his address to be used for the delivery of a parcel. The arrangement was that the prisoner would be on hand at those premises to sign for the parcel itself. When the courier/agent arrived with the parcel on 7 September the prisoner was not in fact present. Mr Anderson could not sign for the parcel. He contacted the prisoner by phone and arranged to pick him up at Leumeah railway station to bring him back to his, Mr Anderson's home, to meet with the courier. The prisoner claimed that he had been delayed in his train travel and this was the reason for him not being there at the appointed time.  
        When Mr Anderson had brought the prisoner back to his Eschol Park home the prisoner identified himself as David Jackson, signed for the parcel and was then driven by Mr Anderson back to Leumeah railway station. It is clear, and he conceded himself, that he was not travelling by train. He had in fact been brought to Leumeah station by the somewhat shadowy and elusive Mr Williams, with whom he made telephone contact, speaking in the Igbolanguage whilst in Mr Anderson's car.  
        The conclusion, based on his own evidence, is that he was to be driven back from the station by Mr Williams who, incidentally it appears, was driving a car registered to the prisoner's wife. Instead the prisoner, together with Mr Anderson and Mr Anderson's partner, were arrested. On arrest the prisoner had in his possession the documentation, including the House airways bill which had previously been firmly affixed to the side of the parcel.  
        He was taken to the Australian Federal Police headquarters and interviewed. In the course of that interview he denied any knowledge of the parcel or, at least, of its contents. He claimed that he had been persuaded by Mr Anderson to sign for the parcel. In the end, at the trial, he gave evidence to a similar effect. That evidence was rejected by the jury.  
        The following facts, it appears to me, emerge from that brief summary:  
        1. The prisoner had contacts in Venezuela, the state of origin of the drugs and he had been in contact with that person or persons between the time of taking the lease of the mailbox and the delivery of the parcel.  
        2. He knew the House airways bill number, but as Mr Fliece points out that may have been obtained by him from the notification left by the Federal Agent masquerading as a courier.  
        3. He had some considerable time before these events to set up the mail box to which the parcel was addressed.  
        4. He attempted several times, by different methods, to distance himself from any personal role in accepting the parcel.  
        5. He set up Mr Anderson to be the recipient and when that did not work he finally emerged to take the parcel himself.  
        6. His methods of communication were designed to avoid discovery and identification. His use of mobile phones in false names, his singular use of public telephones when communicating with the agent/courier, establish that intention.  
        
       
       
      Issues on appeal  
      
    8 The grounds of appeal relied on by the appellant are as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        Appeal against conviction:  
         
         
        1. His Honour erred in not directing a verdict of not guilty.  
         
         
        Appeal against sentence:  
         
         
        2. His Honour erred in giving very limited weight to the Appellant’s youth and lack of prior convictions.  
         
         
        3. The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.  
        
       
      
    9 I will deal in turn with the appeal against conviction and the application for leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
       
      Appeal against conviction  
      
    10 Mr Stratton SC for the appellant submitted that the elements of the substantive offence under s 307.6 of the Code were that:  
     
      
      (a) the person possesses a substance; and  
      (b) the substance was unlawfully imported; and  
      (c) the substance is a border-controlled drug or border-controlled plant; and  
      (d) the quantity possessed is a marketable quantity.  
      
    11 The only element requiring conduct by the alleged offender is the possession; and accordingly, Mr Stratton submitted, for an attempt to commit an offence under s 307.6, the attempt must relate to possession. Such an attempt, he submitted, would only be a criminal act if the other elements of the offence were made out; but in this case, neither element (b) nor element (c) were made out, because the only relevant border-controlled substance, the cocaine, remained in Venezuela.  
     
      
    12 Accordingly, he submitted, the trial judge should have directed a verdict of acquittal.  
     
      
    13 Mr Stratton submitted that this argument was supported by R v Barbouttis (1995) 37 NSWLR 256, and that R v Mai (1992) 26 NSWLR 371 was distinguishable.  
     
      
    14 It was submitted for the Crown that there could be an attempt to commit an offence under s 307.6 even where there had not been an actual importation of a border-controlled drug; and the Crown relied on Britten v Alpogut [1987] VR 929 and Mai. The Crown submitted that Barbouttis did not support the appellant’s contention. The Crown also submitted that this was confirmed by s 11.1 of the Code.  
     
      
    15 Because the appeal could involve reconsideration of Barbouttis, a previous decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, a bench of five was constituted for the hearing of the appeal.  
     
      
    16 Barbouttis concerned a charge arising out of a police operation in which, for the purpose of exposing persons suspected of dealing in stolen cigarettes, an undercover police officer sought out persons interested in acquiring, at a very cheap price, cigarettes were represented to have been stolen. The undercover officer made contact with the three persons charged and others; and they expressed an interest in buying stolen cigarettes from him. After a number of meetings, an agreement was entered into: the undercover officer had a truck in which there were loaded eighty boxes of cigarettes, and according to the Crown, the persons charged (and others) agreed to purchase fifty of those boxes.  
     
      
    17 The charge was that the persons in question “did conspire … to commit a criminal offence, namely the offence of receiving stolen property”. The particulars, included in the indictment, were expressed as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        The object of the conspiracy was the purchase of cigarettes which the accused believed were stolen. At no stage were these cigarettes stolen. The cigarettes were obtained and placed in a truck by police officers for the purpose of satisfying the accused that there were in fact cigarettes available to be supplied to them upon the payment of money.  
        
       
      
    18 In the District Court, Graham DCJ quashed the indictment. An appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed by majority (Smart and Dunford JJ, Gleeson CJ dissenting). Special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia was granted, but when the appeal was argued the High Court revoked special leave, giving the following reasons:  
     
      
       
        
        In this case, an indictment was presented charging a conspiracy to receive stolen property, namely specific cartons of cigarettes in the back of a particular truck. The cigarettes were not in fact stolen. The indictment was quashed by the trial judge and, by majority (Smart and Dunford JJ; Gleeson CJ dissenting), the Court of Criminal Appeal affirmed that decision. The Crown obtained special leave to appeal in order to address the question whether impossibility of commission of an offence precluded conviction for a conspiracy to commit that offence. However, on analysis a problem arises from the pleading of the particulars in the indictment. The particulars allege:  
         
         
        The object of the conspiracy was the purchase of cigarettes which the Accused believed were stolen.  
         
         
        The phrase ""which the Accused believed were stolen"" was accepted to be merely descriptive of the cigarettes and not an object of the conspiracy. Although the Solicitor-General accepts that the beliefs of the alleged conspirators would have to be communicated one to the other - either expressly or impliedly - before the element of ""stolen-ness"" would be encompassed by the conspiracy, the indictment made no such allegation. The belief of the respective Accused is alleged merely as a state of mind, not as an element of the agreement that was allegedly made.  
         
         
        Because the indictment is framed in this way, no question of impossibility arises. The real problem in the case is simply one of identifying the confines of the agreement charged in the indictment. As the question of impossibility does not arise, the appropriate order is that the grant of special leave be revoked. The Court orders accordingly.  
        
       
       
      The Queen v Barbouttis 
       S51/1996 [1996] HCATrans 397 (2 October 1996) 
       
      
    19 It appears that the High Court decided that case on an interpretation of the indictment, as not alleging an agreement to receive stolen property, but merely as alleging an agreement to receive particular property which the accused persons (individually, and possibly without communication of this belief among themselves) believed was stolen. It would thus not have been inconsistent with the High Court decision for a fresh indictment to have been presented, with particulars making it clear that the allegation was that the agreement among the accused was to receive stolen property, namely the particular property having the character of stolen property, as they all (to the knowledge of all of them) believed the particular property to be.  
     
      
    20 So far as concerns the Court of Criminal Appeal decision, it seems that the judgment of Dunford J may have proceeded on the same basis as the High Court decision: he agreed with Gleeson CJ as to the status of relevant authorities (to some of which I will return); but having identified the alleged agreement as being to receive the particular cigarettes, he said that the carrying out of that agreement would not have been criminal, irrespective of the beliefs of the accused (37 NSWLR at 278-279). Although it is not entirely clear, it could be that if the alleged agreement had been to receive stolen property, namely the particular cigarettes having the character of stolen property, Dunford J may have agreed with Gleeson CJ.  
     
      
    21 Smart J took a different view as to the status of the authorities; and it does not appear that his decision depended crucially on the particular way the indictment was framed.  
     
      
    22 Gleeson CJ, in dissent, addressed the question of the proper characterisation of the agreement alleged in that case ((1995) 37 NSWLR 256 at 265-6) as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        In the context of conspiracy, the matter must depend upon the proper characterisation of the object of the agreement made by the conspirators, or what the Court of Appeal of New Zealand called “the common design”. In the present case, as particularised by the Crown, was the obtaining of stolen goods part of the common design, or can the agreement, for the purposes of the criminal law, be characterised accurately and adequately as an agreement to acquire fifty particular boxes of cigarettes for a certain price, such agreement being accompanied by a merely incidental belief that the reason the cigarettes were so cheap was that they were stolen? 
        If the cigarettes had in truth been stolen, then such a characterisation would certainly not have been regarded as either accurate or adequate for the purposes of the criminal law. Far from being incidental, the belief that the cigarettes were stolen would have been of the essence of the agreement. How can that belief cease to be of the essence of the agreement because of an objective fact unknown to the parties to the agreement?  
        On the facts alleged by the Crown, the common design of the respondents and the other parties to the agreement was to obtain stolen property. The law relating to conspiracy punishes people because of the nature of the agreement they have made. I find it impossible to regard the (alleged) belief on the part of the parties to the agreement that the cigarettes were stolen as a merely incidental matter. For the reasons advanced by Professor Glanville Williams, the motivation theory, which underlies the argument that the belief was incidental, cannot be sustained. If a person intends to receive goods which he knows or believes are stolen, than he intends to receive stolen goods.  
        
       
      
    23 Plainly, the High Court did not agree with that analysis as the correct construction of the indictment in that case: the High Court held to the effect that, although the charge alleged a conspiracy (and thus an agreement) to receive stolen property, the particulars showed that the agreement alleged did not have that character. On the other hand, it is clear from that passage from the judgment of Gleeson CJ that he did not consider that the particulars detracted in that way from what was alleged in the charge itself; and in effect construed the charge and particulars together as alleging an agreement to receive stolen property, that is, the particular cigarettes having the character of stolen property.  
     
      
    24 Accepting that the construction of the charge and particulars adopted by the High Court was correct, I would make the comment that it would perhaps be expected that a first instance judge or an intermediate court of appeal, having full power to deal with the merits of the case, would identify such a technical problem; so that, if the real issue was seen as one of substance, the judge or court could allow or foreshadow allowance of any necessary amendment of the indictment and deal with the question of substance.  
     
      
    25 Returning to the judgments in Barbouttis in the Court of Criminal Appeal, in my opinion the analysis of the cases by Gleeson CJ is correct, and of relevance both to charges of conspiracy and to charges of attempt (although I accept that these different offences can raise different issues). I would respectfully adopt that analysis in its entirety, in preference to that of Smart J. Thus I would endorse the following paragraph from the judgment of Dunford J in Barbouttis (at 277):  
     
      
       
        
        For the reasons given by the Chief Justice, I agree that  
        R v Smith 
         ( 
        Roger 
        ) [1975] AC 476 and  
        Anderton v Ryan 
         [1985] AC 560 no longer reflect the law in Australia relating to criminal attempts to commit offences which are impossible and that such law is as laid down by this Court in  
        R v Mai 
         (1992) 26 NSWLR 371 following  
        Britten v Alpogut 
         [1987] VR 929 and  
        R v Lee 
         (1990) 47 A Crim R 187. I likewise agree with him that the status of  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Nock 
         [1978] AC 979 as a persuasive authority in this State of the law relating to conspiracies to achieve the impossible has been undermined by the decision of the House of Lords in  
        R v Shivpuri 
         [1987] AC 1 not to follow  
        R v Smith 
         and  
        Anderton v Ryan 
        , and by the subsequent refusal by the Australian courts, including this Court, to follow  
        R v Smith 
        .  
        
       
       
      See also  
      R v El Azzi 
       (2001) 125 A Crim R 113 and  
      R v El Azzi 
       [2004] NSWCCA 455.  
       
      
    26 Thus, in my opinion, both Britten and Mai were correctly decided.  
     
      
    27 In Britten, the charge was one of attempting to import prohibited imports into Australia contrary to the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). The defendant believed he was importing, and intended to import, cannabis; but the substance which he believed to be cannabis was found to be another substance which was not a prohibited import. It was held that, in order to prove the statutory crime of attempting to import prohibited imports into Australia, what the Crown had to prove was that the accused intended to import something which was, as a matter of law, a prohibited import, as he knew, and that in pursuance of that intention he did acts sufficiently proximate to the intended commission of the crime; so that the magistrate had been in error to dismiss the information in reliance on Haughton v Smith [1975] AC 476.  
     
      
    28 In Mai the defendant was charged with attempting to obtain possession of heroin illegally imported into Australia. Heroin illegally imported into Australia had been removed from a suitcase by Federal Police and they had substituted plaster of Paris; and the defendant came to be in possession of plaster of Paris, believing it to be heroin. The Court of Criminal Appeal held he was properly convicted.  
     
      
    29 Mr Stratton submitted that Mai was distinguishable from the present case, because in Mai the substitution did not take place until after the heroin arrived in Australia; so that there was in truth a substance illegally imported into Australia, possession of which the accused attempted to obtain.  
     
      
    30 If one restricts attention to the elements of the attempted offence, then, in my opinion, in accordance with Britten, the question in truth turns on whether an accused person intends each element of the relevant crime to occur, and in pursuance of that intention does acts that are not merely preparatory but are sufficiently proximate to the intended commission of the crime. Where an element of the relevant offence is that there be a border-controlled drug that has been imported into Australia, then for there to be an attempt there must be an intention that there be such a drug that has been imported; but it is not necessary that this actually be the case. (However, as appears below, the distinction between the facts of this case and those of Mai could possibly have significance in relation to the defence provided by s 307.6(5) of the Code.)  
     
      
    31 Mr Stratton also submitted that the approach supported by Mai would produce unsatisfactory results:  
     
      
       
        
        16. Consider the case of a man who marries a woman believing that her husband is still alive. In fact the husband has recently died (see  
        Haughton v Smith 
         [1975] AC 476 at 500). On the reasoning of  
        Regina v Mai 
        , the man could be convicted of attempted bigamy.  
        17. Consider the case of a man who has sexual intercourse with a girl who he believes is under the age of 16, whereas in truth she is over the age of 16. On the reasoning of Regina v Mai, he could not be convicted of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 16 (s.66C), but he could be convicted of attempting to have sexual intercourse with the girl (see Regina v Barbouttis at 261, per Gleeson CJ).  
        18. Consider the case of a man who takes an umbrella from an umbrella stand, intending to steal it, and believing it not to be his own. However, it turns out that in truth the umbrella belonged to him (see Regina v Collins (1864) 9 Cox CC 497). On the reasoning of Regina v Mai, he would be guilty of attempted larceny even though objectively no larceny had taken place.  
        
       
      
    32 I accept that, on the approach supported by Mai, there could be conviction for attempt in these three cases; although it does seem unlikely that in cases such as these there would be evidence capable of proving intent beyond reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    33 So far, I have dealt with the question of attempt on the basis of case law; but in the present case it must be determined on the basis of s 11.1. In my opinion, the effect of s 11.1(2), (3) and (4)(a) is no different from that of the general law, as expounded in the cases and judgments referred to above which I consider to be correct. Thus, subject to what I say about s 11.1(6), a conviction for attempt was available in this case.  
     
      
    34 However, a question arises whether s 11.1(6) has some different effect. Mr Stratton referred the Court to a publication of the Commonwealth Attorney-General’s Department entitled “The Commonwealth Criminal Code – a Guide for Practitioners”, which at pages 241 and 243 contains the following commentary on s 11.1(6):  
     
      
       
        
        Most applications of the principle are obvious: self defence, duress and sudden or extraordinary emergency will excuse both assault and attempted assault. If Parliament chooses to impose a limitation period for prosecution of an offence, the limitation applies equally to the pendant offence of attempt. Applications of the principle cause no problem in these cases because the distinction between defences or procedural rules and the elements of an offence are obvious. Applications of the principle in cases involving ""limitations"" or ""qualifying provisions"" require more care. Take a simple example first of all. In state and territorial jurisdictions the traditional form of the prohibition against unlawful abortion takes the following form: ""Whosoever, being a woman with child, unlawfully administers to herself...&c."" A woman who took an abortifacient drug in the mistaken belief that she was pregnant cannot be held guilty of the offence of course: pregnancy is an essential circumstantial element of the offence. Suppose she is charged instead with an attempt to commit the offence. It seems highly unlikely that the common law would permit conviction of an attempt in these circumstances. Since the attempt and completed offence are equally punishable at common law, the legislative rationale for restricting the offence to pregnant women applies with equal force to the attempt. If a provision such as s 11.1(6) were to govern the interpretation of the offence it would reinforce that inference of legislative intention. The pregnancy limitation is a ""limitation or qualifying provision"" which governs the offence and the attempt alike. The Commonwealth  
        Customs Act 
         provisions on narcotic drugs contain a similar, though more contentious example. There is no doubt that a person who packs a parcel of oregano in a hollow walking stick and brings it into Australia, in the mistaken belief that it is cannabis, is guilty of an attempt to import cannabis, a prohibited import; impossibility of success is no answer to a charge of attempted importation. Suppose, however, that this incompetent is charged with one of the offences of attempted possession of a prohibited drug contrary to s233B(1). In each of these possession offences, conviction of the principal offence requires proof that the drug was ""imported into Australia in contravention of this Act"". That limitation or qualification on liability for the principal offence should equally apply to the attempt so as to bar the possibility of conviction. The legislative rationale for the exception is the same, whether the attempt, or completed offence is in issue.  
        
       
      
    35 This discussion raises the question of whether the absence of an element of an offence could give rise to a defence, limitation or qualifying provision that applies to the offence, within s 11.1(6). In my opinion, generally it could not: those expressions in s 11.1(6) are apt to refer to matters extrinsic to the elements of the offence, rather than to the requirement on the prosecution to prove all the elements of the offence.  
     
      
    36 Where it is only a limited class of persons who can commit the offence, such as a woman with child, then it is arguable that this is not so much an element of the offence as a limitation or qualifying provision; in which case, arguably, a person who is not a woman with child could not be guilty of an attempt in the circumstances described in the quoted passage. Another example might be an offence that can only be committed by breaching something of the nature of an apprehended violence order: if a person mistakenly believes that he or she is affected by such an order, intends to breach that (supposed) order, and does an act that would be in breach of the order if it existed, it is arguable that this would not amount to a criminal offence of attempting to breach an apprehended violence order, because the limitation of the offence to the particular class of persons is a limitation or qualifying provision within s 11.1(6). (Indeed, I am inclined to think the same would apply at general law: where what is made criminal is not conduct by persons at large but only conduct by a limited class of persons, it is arguable that it is not intended that attempts other than by persons who are in fact within the limited class should also be criminal.)  
     
      
    37 As regards s 233B of the Customs Act, that section, as it was in 1975, was considered in Beckwith v The Queen [1976] HCA 55; (1976) 135 CLR 569; and it was held that s 233B disclosed an intention that an attempt to commit an offence against s 233B(1)(ca) should not be an offence. At that time, s 233B(1)(ca) provided that any person who without reasonable excuse (proof of which shall lie upon him) has in his possession any prohibited imports to which this section applies which are reasonably suspected of being imported into Australia in contravention of this Act, shall be guilty of an offence. A defence to such a charge was provided by s 233B(1B) if “the person proves that the goods were not imported into Australia or were not imported into Australia in contravention of this Act”.  
     
      
    38 If (contrary to the decision in Beckwith) there could have been a charge of attempting to commit an offence against s 233B(1)(ca) as it then was, then the defence under s 233B(1B) would in my opinion have been a defence as the word is used in s 11.1(6), and thus according to s 11.1(6) a defence to a charge of attempt. However, if “importation into Australia in contravention of this Act” is truly an element of an offence (rather than a defence of the kind provided by s 233(1B) as it then was), then in my opinion the absence of that element would not be a defence, limitation or qualification that applies to the offence, within s 11.1(6). To that extent, I would disagree with the comment towards the end of the quotation set out above.  
     
      
    39 However, the above discussion points to a possible significance of s 307.6(5), which in my opinion is plainly a defence within s 11.1(6) and thus would apply to attempts to commit a s 307.6 offence.  
     
      
    40 It could be argued that it was in this case established that there was no border-controlled drug that the appellant knew was unlawfully imported. Thus, it could be argued, the appellant fell within the words of s 307.6(5) in that he “did not know that the border-controlled drug was unlawfully imported”; so that by reason of s 11.1(6), the appellant had a defence to the charge of attempt. It could be contended that while the appellant believed and intended that the package received in Australia contained a border-controlled drug that was unlawfully imported, he did not and could not know this, because it was not the fact. It could be contended that the appellant also believed and intended that the border-controlled drug that had been seized in Venezuela was unlawfully imported into Australia, but for the same reason he did not and could not know this.  
     
      
    41 The contrary position is that s 307.6(5) is directed to, and limited to, the situation where there is in fact a border-controlled drug that has been unlawfully imported, but the accused proves he or she did not know this fact.  
     
      
    42 In support of the availability of s 307.6(5) as a defence in the present case, it can be said that the literal requirements of s 307.6(5) are met in the way set out above, with the accused’s onus of proof being satisfied by evidence led in the prosecution case; that while in its application to a substantive offence under s 307.6, s 307.6(5) operates in a situation where there is in fact a border-controlled drug that has been unlawfully imported, that does not mean it can only operate in that way in its application to an attempt; and that any doubt about the application of s 307.6(5) should be resolved in favour of the accused (cf Beckwith at 576-577, R v Adams [1935] HCA 62; (1935) 53 CLR 563 at 567-568).  
     
      
    43 However, in my opinion the better view (which I adopt) is that s 307.6(5) is not available as a defence in a case like the present, for the following reasons:  
     
      
      (1) The language of s 307.6(5), in the context of s 307.6 as a whole, strongly implies that it operates only where there is in fact a border-controlled drug that has been unlawfully imported, but the accused did not know this: that is, that it should be read as if it applied if the accused “did not know that the border-controlled drug (that is, the border-controlled drug which was in fact unlawfully imported) was unlawfully imported”.  
      (2) This implication has strong confirmation from the consideration that, under s 307.6(5), it is the accused who must prove lack of knowledge, whereas exclusion of “knowledge” because of the non-existence of the fact can arise (as it did in this case) from the prosecution evidence.  
      (3) The whole rationale of the s 307.6(5) defence has to do with lack of mens rea, which would not apply in relation to a case such as the present.  
      
    44 For those reasons, in my opinion, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.  
     
      
       
      Application for leave to appeal against sentence  
      
    45 In support of ground 2, Mr Stratton referred to R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231, where Hunt J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Lee CJ at CL agreed) said (at 238):  
     
      
       
        
        The judge did take into account the circumstance that the respondent had no previous convictions. That was an error. Couriers are usually selected because they have no criminal records, and this Court has said on many occasions that the leniency extended to first offenders does not ordinarily benefit couriers: see, eg,  
        Leroy 
         [1984] 2 NSWLR 441 at 446-7; (1984) 13 A Crim R 469 at 447;  
        Poyner 
         (1986) 17 A Crim R 162 at 164;  
        Thiagarajah 
         (1989) 41 A Crim R 45 at 49;  
        Cartwright 
         at 248.  
        
       
      
    46 Mr Stratton referred to the following passage from the sentencing remarks of the trial judge:  
     
      
       
        
        It is accepted that he has no prior criminal record but, as is pointed out in a number of authorities, including  
        Ferrer-Esis 
        , a case which has been followed many times since, the possession of good character and youth are of much less weight in offences of this description because frequently those who possess those qualities are deliberately drawn to commit the crimes in the hope that they will not be detected because of their known propensities or record.  
        
       
      
    47 Mr Stratton submitted that the reasoning in Ferrer-Esis did not apply, because there was no suggestion that the appellant had been recruited or selected by anyone; so that the appellant was entitled to have his youth and prior good character taken into account on sentence.  
     
      
    48 On ground 3, Mr Stratton submitted that the trial judge’s starting point for the head sentence (nine years) and the non-parole period (six years) were according to Judicial Commission statistics for the offence of importing a marketable quantity of cocaine, equal to the highest such sentence, despite the fact that the quantity involved in this case was towards the bottom of the marketable quantity. Mr Stratton referred also to R v Wong and Leung [1999] NSWCCA 420; (1999) 48 NSWLR 340, R v Chapple [2001] NSWCCA 183, R v Hendricks [2001] NSWCCA 396; (2001) 125 A Crim R 303, and R v Boulghourgian [2001] NSWCCA 460; (2001) 125 A Crim R 540.  
     
      
    49 In my opinion, as submitted by the Crown, there was no error by the trial judge in giving less weight to the appellant’s youth and lack of prior convictions, having regard to the nature of the offence: cf Okafor v R [2007] NSWCCA 147 at [47].  
     
      
    50 Also, as submitted by the Crown, cases such as Korgbara v R [2007] NSWCCA 84; (2007) 71 NSWLR 187 and El Ghourani v R [2009] NSWCCA 140 indicate that the sentence in this case is within the range open to the trial judge, having regard to the circumstances of this case.  
     
      
    51 For those reasons, in my opinion, the challenge to sentence is not made out.  
     
      
       
      ORDER  
      
    52 For the reasons I have given, I propose the following orders:  
     
      
      (1) Appeal against conviction dismissed.  
      (2) Leave to appeal against sentence granted and appeal against sentence dismissed.

    JUDGMENT1. Dean Harold Irwin came before me in July it would seem of last year on two aggravated break enter and steal offences for which he had pleaded guilty before the magistrate. He spent a total of two hundred and something days in custody to that time although - I think it was two hundred and fifty something days of custody but not all of that time was referable solely to the two offences, or either of them that are before me. 2. There was something in the subjective material that indicated to me two matters. Firstly, that his behaviour such as it was may have had an explanation. He has not known his own father and at about the time he began his criminal spree he had made contact with his paternal grandparents and was hoping that from that there would be some communication with his father. That did not occur and he may have been angry about that, he certainly may have been depressed about it. Both the anger and the depression resulted in his consumption of alcohol for which he apparently has a taste. He concedes now that he is an alcoholic. It was inevitably in the course of his being drunk that he would commit the offences, at least the two offences that are before me. 3. As happens often with a lot of us in society the point comes when one realises that one parent or the other, or both, are having nothing to do with the child.4. In this case it would appear that one parent that is the natural father has made a choice not to make connections with the child. There may be all sorts of reasons for that and it is not appropriate to speculate. There are two ways in which that can be handled it seems to me by a person. One is the relatively immature way in which it was handled, that is to be angry and seek solace in the alcohol. Or the other is to use it to become a stronger person. I would have thought that somebody who has displayed the obvious courage that I have seen from this young man ought to have looked firstly in trying to use it to strengthen himself rather that the other. 5. The second was an indication somewhere in the material that he just might have come to a point where he’d had enough of custody and of the lifestyle. I cannot quite pick that up at the moment. It was for that reason that I, with a good deal of trepidation I might say, decided that I would give him a chance. The trepidation was that my primary responsibility when I do these things is to be concerned for the safety of the community and the rate at which he had been criminally offending was, for a young man, quite alarming. 6. Part of his bail conditions were that he was required to go into full time rehabilitation. During the course of that period he was treated for a disciplinary matter when, doing the best I can to remember, someone or perhaps more than one of his colleagues participating in the rehabilitation had used, or had access to drugs and had used I cannot quite remember that scenario; and it was agreed as a term of his entry that he would disclose those sorts of matters if and when they came about. He did not disclose them and was put out for a week or two, I think it might have been two weeks.7. He became concerned once he was outside the structure of that organisation. Each day returned to them to ask them to reconsider. After three days they did and took him in. I remember asking him what it was that concerned him. He felt that he was all alone and was, I guess, terrified that he might fall back on to alcohol or drugs. That then raised for me a new problem which was “How would he settle once he had finished the course”. It no doubt was a matter that he also was concerned with but to his credit he has looked for and obtained and apprenticeship - sorry, continuing his apprenticeship, but obtained work with a registered qualified plumber, Metro Plumbing Services, as an apprentice. He has plans at the completion of his apprenticeship, and presumably when it is appropriate for him so to do in terms of his experience, to set himself up in his own business as a tradesman; that looks good. 8. As a condition of his bail he was required to do something in respect of community participation. In particular it seems to me the obvious community participation he should do was to participate in some sporting activity. He chose to play with Waverley old Boys in Rugby. Waverley Christian Brothers was a school that he had been at, but had expelled him for drinking and fighting on the football field. I have some experience with sub district rugby and I know them to be a relatively strong club and staffed by, if staffed is the right word, members, being so far as I am aware relatively good people, and some of them actually quite good footballers. He tells me that he may look to participate in under twenty-one rugby with Randwick. I have seen sport as service to the community. 9. The logic of that from my point of view is, and you only have to think about the season we are currently at, we have Australia playing the Maori’s tonight; we have the finals of the rugby union; we have the semi-finals of the rugby league; we have just finished watching a friendly soccer game against Korea. Australians have a great love of sport, they use their sporting heroes as role models. Sometimes it’s not a good thing to be a sporting hero because there is an extra duty placed upon them of being a role model. Certainly participation in community life and very frequently in my experience with footballers is that it leads to further participation either in connection with the administration of football or in other areas. I see that as a good thing.10. I said at the time that I dealt with this, I must have because it is just so obvious that it really needs no repeating, when I dealt with this in my initial remarks that the offences were serious. They are bad examples of breaking and entering. The appellant would have been given sentences at least of the order of two years and probably more in respect of each, although it is fair to say he would not have necessarily been given - I cannot say at this distance, would not necessarily have been given a full two year sentence, but he was pretty out of control and rehabilitation was a factor I would have had to take into account. 11. I am far more confident now about the rehabilitation prospects than I was then and in fact Mr Irwin needs to be complemented, I guess, for the immense progress that he has made. My intention in respect of these two offences is now they can be best dealt with by giving him a suspended sentence in respect of each. In a way I have approached this the wrong way because in the normal course of events, I would assess the appropriate penalty and then look at the question of a discount but I have decided to give him the benefit of the discount, one, by giving him the s 11 and two, by suspending the sentence when I ultimately have imposed it. 12. I will note that the Crown initially did dispute but now does not dispute the awarding of a suspended sentence for these offences. I would say that is in part because of the tremendous progress that has been made in the course of the last twelve months.13. The formal orders I make are that Dean Irwin is convicted of each offence. I should have done that already because I need to do that before I give a s 11. In respect of each he is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years. That term will be suspended upon condition that he enter into a bond pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to be of good behaviour for a period of two years from today. That Bond will have as its conditions that he continue with AA for the next twelve months at least, and that he continue with private counselling with the gentlemen he described as Derek(?) until such time as Derek says that his counselling is no longer required. And finally I had better make it subject to supervision of Probation and Parole simply to guarantee that those two things are done. 14. There may be a bit of drug and alcohol counselling that they will also recommend for you but I should hope not because you are getting it really.

     Headnote 
    The appellant was indicted and faced trial before a jury on 11 counts, 10 of which concerned the supply of drugs. The events giving rise to the charges spanned the period between 13 March 2006 and 19 May 2006. At the trial the Crown gave notice under s 101 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) in order to lead, as tendency evidence, a series of taped conversations of the appellant which occurred on dates other than on the dates on which the charged offences occurred. The trial judge heard argument about the admissibility of these recordings. Defence counsel submitted a global objection to particular conversations in the notice based on potential prejudice if the jury gave unnecessary emphasis to events not the subject of the charge. The trial judge admitted the evidence. The trial judge gave directions about the use of the tendency evidence both before the evidence was seen by the jury and again at the conclusion of the trial. There was no objection from defence counsel at the trial as to the form of the directions. The jury found the appellant guilty of five counts on his indictment of supplying a prohibited drug and one count of supplying an amount of a prohibited drug not being an amount less than a commercial quantity of the drug (accumulated over two separate supplies). The appellant was sentenced to an overall head sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of five and a half years. The appellant appealed against the conviction and if unsuccessful sought leave to appeal against his sentence. The appeal grounds against conviction were: 
     
      
      i) the trial miscarried because of the admission into evidence of the tendency evidence; and 
       
      ii) the trial miscarried because the learned trial judge did not give the jury adequate directions about what use could be made of the tendency evidence. 
      
    The appeal grounds against sentence were: 
     
      
      iii) the trial judge erred in failing to consider s 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) with respect to the first count of conviction;  
       
      iv) the trial judge erred in failing to consider that the commercial quantity was reached by accumulating amounts individually supplied on two different occasions; and  
      
    v) the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. Held dismissing the appeal on conviction, allowing leave to appeal on sentence and dismissing the appeal against sentence:Conviction Allsop P (Price and Harrison JJ agreeing) 
     
      
      1) The trial did not miscarry due to the admission of the tendency evidence: 
       
        
        a) The objection to the tendency evidence made by the defence at trial only covered the particular identified conversations in the notice to which objection was raised and not all of the evidence: [31].  
         
        b) At trial defence counsel argued prejudice in the identified conversations on a “global” basis and the trial judge dealt with the objection in a way that reflected the manner in which the objection was argued: [35] -[36]. 
         
        c) The “global approach” and the nature of the expressed prejudice meant that what was put on appeal as prejudice was never articulated before the trial judge so there was no error: [36]. 
         
        d) The Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) ss 97 and 101 did not require the trial judge to examine each conversation in the evidence separately or to deal with the objections in a way differently to the overall global approach taken by counsel in argument: [37]. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      2) The trial did not miscarry due to the directions given to the jury in relation to the tendency evidence: 
       
        
        a) The jury needed to be given clear directions about how the tendency evidence should not be used: [41].  
         
        b) In this case the clarity of the directions can be seen from the terms of the words used and the lack of objection by counsel in the context of discussion that took place in the absence of the jury: [54]. 
         
        c) The directions given were adequate to deal with bad character. The jury were plainly told not to reason that the appellant was guilty of the offences charged because he had committed other offences: [58].  
        
       
      
    SentencingAllsop P (Price and Harrison JJ agreeing):  
     
      
      3) The trial judge did not fail to consider s 21A(3)(e) of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW): 
       
        
        a) Offences committed after the date of commission of the offence for which the offender stands for sentence may not be taken into account for the purpose of imposing a heavier sentence, but may be considered for deciding whether the offender is deserving of leniency: [69].  
         
        b) The trial judge’s remarks on sentencing reflect a view that the later offences could and should be taken into account when denying leniency and though the trial judge did not refer directly to s 21A3(e) the trail judge directed her remarks to it: [70]  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      4) The trial judge did not fail to consider the circumstances in which the count for commercial supply had been made out: 
       
        
        a) The fact that the commercial quantity had been reached only by accumulating amounts individually supplied on different occasions to different persons is a matter which may, when appropriate be taken into account when imposing sentence for the single offence charged: [72]  
         
        b) The remarks on sentence show no error in the way that the trial judge dealt with the two acts of supply and it was clear that the judge was aware of the relevant circumstances establishing the offence: [72] – [73]. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      5) The sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive. The sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness as below the midrange and the non parole period determined reflected that assessment: [77].

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: The appellant appeals against conviction and seeks leave to appeal against sentence in relation to six counts of supplying a prohibited drug. For the reasons that appear below the conviction appeal should be dismissed, leave should be granted on the sentence appeal and the sentence appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      The indictment and convictions 
       
      
    2 On 11 September 2007 the appellant was arraigned before a judge of the District Court and a jury of 12 at Parramatta. On the appellant’s indictment there were 11 counts, 10 of which concerned the supply of drugs and one concerned the sale of a prohibited firearm. The events giving rise to the charges spanned the period between 13 March 2006 and 19 May 2006.  
     
      
    3 Count 1 was that between 13 March 2006 and 16 March 2006 at Auburn the appellant supplied an amount of a prohibited drug namely 150 grams of MDMA (Ecstasy), being an amount not less than the commercial quantity for that drug. The appellant was convicted of this count.  
     
      
    4 Counts 2 and 3 were in the alternative to count 1 and dealt with the alleged supply on 14 March 2006 and 16 March 2006 at Auburn of MDMA (Ecstasy) in an amount of 25 grams and 125 grams, respectively. These two alleged supplies constituted the supply in Count 1. 
     
      
    5 Counts 4, 5 and 6 concerned events on 26 March 2006. Count 4 was that on 26 March 2006 at Auburn the appellant sold a prohibited firearm, namely an imitation of a Beretta self-loading pistol, to one Adam Jackson, who was not authorised to possess the prohibited firearm by licence or permit. The appellant was found not guilty of this charge. 
     
      
    6 Count 5 was that on 26 March 2006 at Auburn the appellant supplied a prohibited drug, namely cannabis, in an amount of 2.5 grams. The appellant was found not guilty of this charge by direction of the trial judge. 
     
      
    7 Count 6 was that on 26 March 2006 at Auburn the appellant supplied a prohibited drug namely methylamphetamine in an amount of 2.57 grams. The appellant was found not guilty of this charge. 
     
      
    8 Count 7 was that on 5 May 2006 at Auburn the appellant supplied a prohibited drug namely methylamphetamine in an amount of 1 gram. The appellant was found guilty of this charge. 
     
      
    9 Count 8 was that on 6 May 2006 at Auburn the appellant supplied a prohibited drug namely MDMA (Ecstasy) in an amount of 12 grams. The appellant was found guilty of this charge. 
     
      
    10 Count 9 was that on 18 May 2006 at Auburn the appellant supplied a prohibited drug namely methylamphetamine in an amount of about 0.3 grams. The appellant was found guilty of this charge. 
     
      
    11 Count 10 was that on 19 May 2006 at Auburn the appellant supplied a prohibited drug namely methylamphetamine in an amount of about 1 gram. The appellant was convicted of this charge. 
     
      
    12 Count 11 was that on 19 May 2006 at Auburn the appellant supplied a prohibited drug namely MDMA (Ecstasy) in an amount of about 0.5 grams. The appellant was convicted of this charge. 
     
      
    13 The Crown case relied principally upon telephone intercepts and an informer’s evidence. There was evidence as to language and the code used in language which was not disputed. Nor was it in dispute that the appellant during his many telephone discussions was talking about drugs. The appellant’s case at the trial as recounted in submissions in this Court, was based on the evidence he gave at the trial upon which he was cross-examined. He gave evidence that “I was talking about it but I’ve never done it” and “I had no intention of doing it at all”. The appellant’s evidence as summarised by the trial judge in the summing up was that “he did not intend to make a genuine offer to supply drugs and never had drugs in his possession for the purposes of supply.” The case for the appellant was that during the time covered by the charges he was a heavy user of methylamphetamine or ice and other drugs and he was “off his head” through the influence of these drugs. The trial judge in her summing up put the appellant’s case that: “The drugs made him lie and big note himself.” Further, as her Honour said, his case was: “He never had access to drugs to supply, nor did he ever intend to supply drugs.” 
     
      
    14 The evidence underlying the various counts was as follows. On 14 March 2006, the appellant had a telephone conversation with a man referred to as “Junior”. During that conversation, the appellant offered to supply 100 tablets of MDMA (Ecstasy) using code words. (This conversation was part of the evidence for Count 1 and the evidence for the alternative Count 2.) On 15 March 2006 the appellant had a telephone conversation with a man referred to as “Ronnie”. The Crown case was that in this conversation the appellant indicated that he had 500 MDMA (Ecstasy) tablets in his possession for the purpose of supply. (This conversation was also part of the evidence for Count 1 and the evidence for the alternative Count 3.) 
     
      
    15 Counts 4, 5 and 6 of which the appellant was found not guilty (as to count 5 by direction) concerned a number of telephone conversations with Mr Jackson. During these telephone conversations there were discussions between the appellant and Mr Jackson about the appellant supplying Mr Jackson with a gun and prohibited drugs. Mr Jackson gave evidence that on 26 March 2006 he met with the appellant in a car and purchased a gun and prohibited drugs. Police had the car under surveillance and subsequently arrested Mr Jackson. 
     
      
    16 On 5 May 2006, the appellant had a telephone conversation with “Junior” in which he agreed to supply “Junior” with one gram of “ice” (methylamphetamine) for $280. This was the evidence in relation to Count 7. 
     
      
    17 On 6 May 2006, the appellant had a telephone conversation with a man referred as “Nathan” and during the call he said that he had 48 tablets in his possession that he was delivering to “Junior”. This was the evidence for Count 8. 
     
      
    18 On 18 May 2006, the appellant had a telephone conversation with someone called “Brad”. In that call, the appellant agreed to supply Brad with three points of “ice cream” (methylamphetamine) for $100. This was the evidence for Count 9. 
     
      
    19 On 19 May 2006, the appellant had a telephone conversation with “Junior”. Junior agreed to sell a gram of “ice cream”. There was a subsequent offer by telephone conversation to reward “Junior” with two ecstasy tablets for selling the drugs. This was the evidence for Counts 10 and 11. 
     
      
       
      The conviction appeal – Ground 1 
       
       
      The trial miscarried because of the admission into evidence of inadmissible tendency evidence 
       
      
    20 At the trial, after the empanelling of the jury there was discussion regarding tendency evidence. The Crown Prosecutor provided a notice pursuant to the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 97 entitled “Notice: Tendency Evidence”. The notice stated that the tendency sought to be proved was the appellant’s “tendency to act in a particular way, namely to supply prohibited drugs.” The notice identified 19 pieces of evidence, including 16 telephone and text message intercepts. The transcript of the trial reveals that counsel for the appellant objected only to items 6 to 14 and items 16 and 17 of paragraph 3 of the notice, being calls 5 to 12 and 14 and 15 of exhibit B. 
     
      
    21 During the argument as to the admissibility of the evidence counsel for the appellant accepted that “there is strong probative value in that particular evidence” when referring to the tendency evidence. Counsel continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “[But] your Honour, as he’s not charged with events between those dates there is a danger I would respectfully submit of unfair prejudice and it may lead the jury to give undue weight to the other material that will be before your Honour.” 
        
       
      
    22 The trial judge in the debate as to admissibility came back shortly thereafter to the question of unfair prejudice. Counsel said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well specifically your Honour the Crown’s indictments are date specific.” 
        
       
      
    23 Counsel later said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It talks again in the main about agreeing to supply prohibited drugs, your Honour we would say that because it’s outside of the period of time in the indictment it’s obviously got strong probative value but the jury would give respectfully undue weight to it and it would therefore be unfairly prejudicial and that material ought to be excluded.” 
        
       
      
    24 The objections to the evidence were made by counsel appearing for the appellant on two bases. The first is identified above, that of prejudice because the evidence was said to be outside the specific dates in the indictment. The second basis was that calls relating to his arrest on 14 April 2006 were not admissible as he had been dealt with in relation to what occurred on that day only for possession of drugs. These were the prejudicial effects identified in discussion with the trial judge. In that discussion with the trial judge counsel clearly accepted that there was substantial probative value. He also accepted the following which came from her Honour in debate: 
     
      
       
        
        “and your global argument is that in any event notwithstanding that all of the evidence has – the prejudicial outweighs that substantial probative value.” 
        
       
      
    25 Defence counsel then explained various matters as to what his client would say about how he wanted to explain his conduct to the jury. In that context, the trial judge said that if character were put in issue the Crown would be entitled to cross-examine on the tendency material in any event. To this counsel said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yes, I suppose I hadn’t viewed it [like] that but I suppose your Honour is right in that.” 
        
       
       
      Later, the Court was informed that the defence would not be running good character. 
       
      
    26 Then, the trial judge asked to hear the Crown Prosecutor on prejudice, on the assumption that it was conceded that there was significant probative value in the evidence. To this the Crown Prosecutor, amongst other things, said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour, with a number of the counts of the indictment the Crown will be relying on an agreement to supply which is what is in the telephone intercepts. For those counts the jury has to be satisfied that the accused intended to make a genuine offer and for the person he’s talking to believes it’s a genuine offer, the jury doesn’t have to be satisfied that he actually had the capacity to supply the drugs …” 
        
       
      
    27 Defence counsel expressed agreement to this. 
     
      
    28 In a brief judgment on 11 September 2007 the trial judge stated the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “HER HONOUR: It having been conceded and there can be no doubt that the evidence which the Crown seeks to call by way of tendency evidence has significant probative value. I am satisfied that the tendency evidence is relevant to proof of facts in issue in the trial. 
        
       
       
        
        Just dealing, in particular, with calls six and seven I am satisfied that they are relevant to a fact in issue in relation to counts three and eight. There can be no doubt that tendency evidence has a prejudicial effect. In this case however I am satisfied that the probative value is substantial and outweighs any prejudicial effect which the evidence may cause taking into account of course the clear and careful directions that a trial judge must give a jury in relation to how to deal with this sort of evidence. I propose to admit it.” 
        
       
      
    29 A number of matters need to be noted before dealing with the arguments put on behalf of the appellant. First, there was only a limited degree of particular treatment of the evidence covered by the tendency notice. Counsel dealt with the evidence as to intercepts dealing with conversations about supply as outside the relevant range of dates (which was incorrect) and upon the likely over emphasis by the jury of evidence beyond the precise dates. Separate submissions were put in relation to the conviction on the possession count arising from the appellant’s arrest on 14 April. The arguments were put globally to the trial judge. The trial judge was not asked to deal with each telephone intercept individually. She did not have submissions put to her about each telephone intercept individually. The trial judge’s short two paragraph judgment is to be understood in the context of the debate that took place before her before delivery of the judgment.30 The submissions of the appellant first complain about call 3 in Exhibit B being a call made on 16 March 2006 in which the appellant made sexist and disparaging remarks about a woman. This was not one of the calls to which objection was taken. It was item 4 of paragraph 3 of the tendency notice. No objection having been taken below, it ought not be allowed to be argued on appeal. 
     
      
    31 The submissions of the appellant sought to construe the reference to a “global” objection as extending the objection to all parts of the tendency notice. This is not what was plainly meant by counsel and by the judge. The “global objection” was to the identified parts of the tendency notice. It was a reference to how counsel was approaching the question of prejudice. All aspects of prejudice were dealt with globally by what he said. He did not deal with each intercepted call individually; he did not ask the judge to do so; her Honour did not do so. No error therefore arose from not having done so.32 The second complaint relates to intercepted items 8, 14 and 16 in para 3 of the tendency notice, and being calls 7, 12 and 14 of Exhibit B. Item 8 (call 7 in exhibit B) contained the appellant saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “We want to go to something Flemington and they won’t let me go because I want to kidnap this guy that bashed …. (unintelligible)” 
        
       
      
    33 Item 14 (call 12 of the exhibit B) contained the appellant discussing burning two cars. Item 16 (call 14 of exhibit B) contained the appellant saying that he was going to “pop someone”. Later in the same tape, the appellant said “I am going to say to him ‘one person who could be bashed is your nephew, break his fuckin’ legs and let him sit at home for six months and recover’”. 
     
      
    34 The appellant complained that the trial judge had not dealt with the particular prejudice of these statements individually. 
     
      
    35 It is clear that the trial judge did not deal with these matters. That is explained, however, by the way the objection was argued. No objection was taken to the tendency material on these grounds or by reference to this content. The judge asked counsel what the prejudice was and received the responses to which I have referred. The essential prejudice asserted was the risk of unnecessary emphasis by the jury on other events not the subject of charges (all of which went to the question of whether or not the conversations related to the charges were to be understood as agreements to supply). 
     
      
    36 The “global” approach and the nature of the expressed prejudice meant that what was put on appeal as prejudice was never articulated before the trial judge. That is why her Honour did not deal with these matters. No error is therefore shown in this respect. 
     
      
    37 Finally, complaint was made based on cases such as R v RN [2005] NSWCCA 413 that the judge should in her reasons have examined each call individually in the assessment of prejudice. Once again, this is not how the matter was argued. The Evidence Act, ss 97 and 101 do not require the trial judge to deal with the objections in her reasons in a way differently to the overall global approach taken by counsel. 
     
      
    38 Ground 1 is not made out. 
     
      
       
      The conviction appeal – Ground 2 
       
       
      The trial miscarried because the trial judge did not give the duly adequate directions about what use could be made of the tendency evidence 
       
      
    39 The appellant submitted that the trial judge’s directions were confusing as to the use that could be made by the jury of the tendency evidence. Further, it was submitted that the trial judge did not warn the jury against using the dangerous form of reasoning that because the appellant had committed other crimes and because he was a person of apparently bad character he must have, or was more likely to have, committed the charged offences. 
     
      
    40 It was submitted that the tendency evidence that was admitted went not just to tendency to deal in drugs but it tended to establish that the appellant was a person who had a tendency to commit crimes generally and that he was a person of bad character. 
     
      
    41 In these submissions it was submitted that the jury should have been given clear directions about how the tendency evidence should not be used. In this respect the appellant referred to B v The Queen [1992] HCA 68; 175 CLR 599 at 619; Donnini v The Queen [1972] HCA 71; 128 CLR 114 at 123; BRS v The Queen [1977] HCA 47; 191 CLR 275; and Bull v The Queen [2000] HCA 24; 201 CLR 443. 
     
      
    42 This submission requires comprehensive reference to what the trial judge told the jury. It is necessary to begin with what the trial judge said to the jury prior to the tendency telephone intercepts (exhibit B) being played to the jury. The following was stated on 12 September 2007: 
     
      
       
        
        “HER HONOUR: Ladies and gentlemen you’re about to be played a second lot of tapes of conversations which took place between the accused and other people and the conversations that you’re about to hear don’t relate to any of the charges on the indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        You remember in relation to the first lot of conversations that you heard the Crown indicated against each transcript the particular charge that the conversation is said to respond to. 
        
       
       
        
        These conversations don’t relate to any of the charges but they occur in the timeframe of the dates of the charges on the indictment and the Crown says that these conversations show the accused offering to supply drugs and having drugs in his possession. 
        
       
       
        
        Now the accused is only charged with the crimes on the indictment and ordinarily it is not permissible to bring evidence of other alleged wrong acts against an accused that don’t relate to the charges against him. That’s because there’s a danger that a jury such as yourself may use it unfairly in this way. It would be unfair to say, well we think he committed crimes on some other occasion, therefore he must have committed the crimes on the indictment. And that’s why – you can see why ordinarily this evidence is not allowed to be brought. 
        
       
       
        
        In this case it’s being brought for a very limited purpose and it’s this. You can consider it in determining whether in that time the accused referred to himself as a drug supplier and offered to supply drugs and had drugs in his possession and you may use as part of the evidence in determining whether the Crown has proved its case on the charges beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        And I’m going to give you much more detailed directions about this at the end of the trial but I just want to say to you – now it’s important to understand that this evidence is not being brought, if you like, as substitute evidence so you can, well look we think he’s committed the crimes charged. It’s before you for a very limited purpose and you must only use that for that limited purpose and not unfairly reason in the way that I’ve discussed with you.” 
        
       
      
    43 Whilst not a direction, the above planted in the jury’s mind the notion of the limited purpose for which the evidence was being led. 
     
      
    44 During the course of the trial the judge sought and obtained assistance from counsel as to the appropriate direction to the jury regarding tendency evidence. Discussion took place in particular between the trial judge and the Crown Prosecutor on this subject matter. The discussions did however also involve defence counsel. The Crown Prosecutor handed up at least two drafts of the proposed direction. This detailed discussion was the background for the terms of the direction and the lack of objection to any part of it by defence counsel including the lack of any request by defence counsel for further direction. 
     
      
    45 The trial judge directed the jury in relation to tendency as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I want to talk to you about some of the evidence that was led in the trial and I gave you a special direction about it at the time. It concerns the evidence in exhibit B, the conversations in exhibit B and the circumstances of the arrest and charging of the accused on 14 April 2006. That evidence as a whole, does not directly relate to any of the charges on the indictment. In closing arguments, that evidence was referred to as tendency evidence. It is called that because if you accepted it beyond reasonable doubt, it can be used to show that a person has a tendency to act in a particular way in certain circumstances. That is why it is called tendency evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        As I said to you at the time the evidence was admitted, the accused is charged only with the counts on the indictment and ordinarily, a jury would not hear evidence of alleged misconduct unrelated to the charges in the indictment. That is because it might lead a jury to reason that if a person has committed an illegal act on some other occasion, then he must have committed an illegal act on some other occasion, then he must have committed the acts charged on the indictment, which is an unfair way of reasoning. That is why that evidence is ordinarily not given. In this case, you may consider the conversations in exhibit B and the evidence and circumstances of the accused’s arrest and charging on 14 April. The Crown says that you would find based on that evidence that during the period covered by the indictment, which is 13 March to 19 May 2006, the accused was acting as a supplier of drugs and had access to drugs for supply. Before you can consider this tendency evidence as part of the proof in the Crown case, you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this finding, that is that the accused was acting as a drug supplier and had access to drugs in this period, you must be satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt. If you are not satisfied of that finding beyond reasonable doubt, then you cannot use all of that evidence in proof of the Crown case and you would put it to one side. 
        
       
       
        
        If you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this evidence shows that during the period of the indictment the accused tended to act as a drug supplier and had access to drugs, then you may use it in the following limited ways. In considering the evidence in the Crown case and in particular the conversation in exhibit A and in the light of the finding, whether it makes it more likely that in those conversations when the accused offered to supply drugs, he intended the other person to believe that the offer was genuine and whether he had the capacity to get drugs. To have drugs in his possession. You can use it in assessing the credibility of the evidence that Mr Jackson gave. That he and the accused agreed that the accused would sell him a gun and drugs and in assessing the accused’s evidence, that he did not intend to make a genuine offer to supply drugs and never had drugs in his possession for the purposes of supply. They are the limited ways in which you may use the evidence. You may not use it to reason in this way. If the accused was acting as a drug dealer in that period and had the capacity to get drugs, then he must have committed the crimes. 
        
       
       
        
        But you may not use it in that way. Nor may you use it to substitute for proof of any of the elements in any of the charges. So for example you may not say, ‘Well we are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, on the evidence in the trial that the Crown has proved this charge, but we will use that finding to substitute for proof beyond reasonable doubt. So it you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the tendency evidence shows that the accused had a tendency to act as a drug dealer and had the capacity to get drugs in that period, then you may use it as proof of the Crown charges but not in substitution for the evidence in the Crown case. I hope I have made that clear.’ 
        
       
      
    46 The trial judge then referred the jury as to how not to use the evidence of other criminal activity: 
     
      
       
        
        “… In relation to both sets of tapes, exhibit A and B, if while listening to them, you form the view that the accused may have been involved in some criminal activities which are unrelated to the charges and which are outside the tendency evidence and the way in which I have told you, you may lawfully use that evidence. Or, if you thought that some of the people to whom he spoke in those conversations, may be engaged in or have engaged in illegal activities, you must then not reason, ‘Well if the accused has committed an offence before or his friends have committed offences, then he must have committed the offences charged on the indictment. That would not be a fair or proper use of the evidence that you have heard in the tapes. It is really important that you keep firmly in your mind that what you must do is determine whether the Crown has proved the charges on the indictment beyond reasonable doubt and use the evidence only in the way that I have said that you should. It is that tendency evidence”. 
        
       
      
    47 In addressing count 1 the trial judge directed in relation to the evidence in Exhibit B: 
     
      
       
        
        “… If you have found the tendency evidence proved beyond reasonable doubt, you may consider the conversations in exhibit B which the Crown says shows that the accused and Junior have a relationship in which the accused supplies drugs to Junior. It was argued to you by the defence that you would not draw that conclusion. It was said to you that the accused was heavily using drugs, Ice and other drugs and that he was, in his words, ‘off his head’ a lot of the time. He lied. He bragged. He big noted himself and that you would not draw that conclusion about is intention.” 
        
       
      
    48 The trial judge interrupted other parts of the summing up to return to the tendency direction in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “To prove that the accused had the drugs actually with him – there is something that I forgot to say so I am going to stop myself. I will go back a little bit. I told you about the tendency evidence. The conversations in exhibit B as a whole and also the evidence of the arrest. There are also some conversations in exhibit B which relate directly to the charges and which you may use in the way that you would use all of the other evidence in the Crown case. So they are outside that limited use and I am going to tell you what they are as we go along. Although they can be looked at as a whole, some of those conversations are actually directly related to the charges and you may use them in an unrestricted way.  
        
       
       
        
        I am sorry, I just realised that I did not say that. Let me go back two steps. Having in possession for supply. To prove that the accused actually had the possession of the drugs for the purpose of supply in the second conversation of the 15 
        th 
        , the Crown relies on what the accused actually said to Ronnie in that conversation on the 15 
        th 
        . The Crown also relies on a conversation between the accused and Nathan, which is tape 2 in exhibit B, which took place about 40 minutes before the accused spoke to Ronnie.” 
        
       
      
    49 There was then a break in the summing up and the judge asked both counsel if there was anything arising. She was informed by both that there was not. In relation to count 8 the trial judge then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… In proving this charge, the Crown relies on what the accused said in the conversation and it relies on the tendency evidence to prove that in this time, the accused was acting as a drug dealer and had the capacity to get drugs for the purposes of supply.” 
        
       
      
    50 Regarding count 10 the trial judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “‘The Crown relies on the tendency evidence which the Crown argues shows that the accused and Junior had a relationship, in which the accused would supply drugs to Junior to sell on his [behalf], in proof of this charge. Just to remind you, you cannot use the tendency evidence as I have said to you, to reason, that if it had happened in the past, then it must have happened at this time. That is an improper way of using it but you can use it as part of the way you look at the evidence on the charge, to determine whether the Crown has proved the charge in the indictment. You cannot use it as a substitution for the evidence in the Crown case”. 
        
       
      
    51 Regarding count 11 she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown case is that if you accept the tendency evidence, you would find that the accused had the capacity to have accessed the drugs and was acting as a drug dealer during the time frame and you can use that evidence on the Crown case as part of the proof of the charges against the accused. In the light of the tendency evidence, it is the Crown case that you would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conversations in exhibit A, on which the charges are based, that the accused intended to make a genuine offer for supply of drugs and he actually had the drugs in his possession when he said so in the calls.” 
        
       
      
    52 At the conclusion of summing up no further direction was sought.53 It can be seen from the summing up that the trial judge sought to make clear to the jury the use that could be made of the evidence. 
     
      
    54 In my view there was nothing confusing about what was said. The clarity with which the direction was given can be seen not only from the terms of the words used but the lack of objection by counsel in the context of the clear discussion as to relevant matters that took place in the absence of the jury. 
     
      
    55 The trial judge made clear for what purposes the evidence could be used and for what it could not be used. In particular, the trial judge made clear that the evidence could not be used against the appellant merely because it might show that he had engaged in some criminal activities unrelated to the charges. 
     
      
    56 The relationship of the evidence to the appellant’s tendency to act as a supplier of drugs and to assess the validity of his evidence that he had not meant what he had said because of his consumption of drugs was made clear. 
     
      
    57 In my view the summing up was not unclear and not confusing and did adequately identify what the evidence could be used for and what it could not be used for. 
     
      
    58 It was also submitted that the directions as to tendency above were inadequate to deal with bad character. It was submitted that it was not clear that the trial judge was talking about offences beyond drug dealing. In my view the directions were adequate and would not have been understood as so restricted. The directions concerned the tapes in exhibits A and B. The phrases “illegal activities” and “criminal activities” used were not restricted to drugs and the jury were plainly told that they were not to reason that the accused was guilty of the offences charged merely because he may have committed other offences. 
     
      
    59 The Crown submitted that even if there were error or confusion in the direction there was no substantial miscarriage of justice: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6. I agree with the Crown’s submissions on s 6. The appellant was involved in about 5000 calls on his mobile phone within a two month period. The calls tended to demonstrate that he frequently arranged to meet people to supply drugs or direct others to supply on his behalf. He had repeated conversations with some people. His defence was that he was addled by drugs and not genuine in his discussions with people. In those circumstances it is, as the Crown submits incredible that those he spoke with continued to deal with him in the circumstances. I agree with the Crown submissions that it would be remarkable for a jury to accept that he sustained this deluded state for about two months without anyone confronting him about his non-performance of the apparent agreements he was undertaking. He had scales in his possession. In all the circumstances, there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice even if it be the case that there was an inadequacy in the direction. 
     
      
       
      The sentence appeal 
       
      
    60 The appellant seeks to rely upon three grounds in support of the application to appeal on sentence. The sentences imposed were as follows:  
     
      
       
      Counts 7, 9, 10 and 11: 18 months fixed term to date from 31 January 2007, up to 30 July 2008. 
       
       
      Count 8: two years fixed term to date from 31 January 2007, up to 30 January 2009. 
       
       
      Count 1: four and a half years non parole period to date from 31 January 2008, up to 30 July 2012, with three and a half years additional term expiring on 30 January 2016.  
       
       
      Matters in a s 166 certificate: two months fixed term to date from 31 January 2007, up to 30 March 2007. 
       
      
    61 The overall effective sentence was five and a half years non-parole period with an additional term of three and a half years making an overall term of nine years. 
     
      
    62 The grounds of appeal concern only the sentence imposed on Count 1. The sentences for count 7, 9, 10 and 11 were subsumed entirely within the sentence for Count 8, as was the sentence for a related offence on the s 166 certificate. 
     
      
    63 The sentence for Count 1 was partially accumulated by one year on the sentences for Counts 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. The non-parole period referable only to Count 1 was an effective three and a half years not four and a half years. 
     
      
    64 Counts 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 were committed whilst the appellant was on bail for a drug offence committed on 14 April 2006. 
     
      
    65 Count 1 concerned the supply of 100 ecstasy tablets on 14 March 2006 and 500 ecstasy tablets on 15 March 2006. The weight of these two supplies of 600 tablets was about 150 grams. 
     
      
       
      The sentence Appeal – Ground 3 
       
      The sentencing judge failed to consider the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999  
      (NSW), s 21A(3)(e) with respect to Count 1 
      
    66 Section 21A(3)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence are as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (e) the defendant does not have any record (or any significant) record of previous convictions …” 
        
       
      
    67 In her Honour’s remarks on sentence the following was stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The appellant] has two convictions for possession of drugs in September 2006 for which he was fined and again in April 2007 which related to the offence for which he was arrested on 14 April 2006 and for which he was again fined. Although the convictions relate to drugs, they do not concern trafficking and I propose to take this criminal record into account as denying the offender the leniency normally given to a first offender.” 
        
       
      
    68 The date of the offences charged under Count 1 were between 13 and 16 March 2006, before the date of the offences for which the appellant had already been sentenced. 
     
      
    69 As the appellant submitted there is authority for the proposition that offences committed after the date of the commission of the offence for which the offender stands for sentence may not be taken into account for the purpose of imposing a heavier sentence, but may be considered for the purpose of deciding whether the offender is deserving of leniency: R v Hutchins (1958) 75 WN (NSW) 75; R v Kennedy (unreported 29 May 1990 NSW Court of Criminal Appeal); R v Boney (unreported 22 July 1991 NSW Court of Criminal Appeal); and see generally R v MAK and MSK [2006] NSWCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at [58] 173. 
     
      
    70 It was submitted that her Honour was in error because although she was entitled to take the later offences into account in an analysis of whether the appellant was deserving of leniency, she was in error in failing to consider s 21A(3)(e). It was also submitted that the offences were dealt with by the sentencing judge so automatically as to deny leniency. I disagree. I would read her Honour’s remarks as reflecting a view that the later offences could and should be taken into account by her in denying leniency. Though her Honour did not expressly refer to s 21A(3)(e), her Honour was referred to that provision and was, in my view, clearly directing her remarks to it. I do not consider that the remarks on sentence reveal that the sentencing judge did not recognise that there was a discretion in this aspect of the sentencing task. The appellant in my view is placing too much emphasis on the expression used by the sentencing judge “as denying the offender the leniency normally given”. Her Honour recognised, and was applying, a discretionary consideration. 
     
      
    71 I see no error in her Honour’s approach. 
     
      
       
      The sentence appeal – Ground 4 
       
       
      The trial judge erred in failing to consider that the commercial quantity was reached by accumulating amounts supplied individually on two different occasions. 
       
      
    72 In R v Hamzy (1994) 74 A Crim R 341 it was held at 351-352 that the fact that the commercial quantity had been reached only by accumulating amounts individually supplied on different occasions to different persons was a matter which may when appropriate be taken into account when imposing sentence for the single offence charged. A commercial quantity of MDMA (Ecstasy) was 125 grams. The amount supplied in relation to Count 1 was 150 grams (adding 125 grams to 25 grams). It was submitted that this was a matter her Honour was obliged to advert to in light of the fact that the addition of the two weights led to a total sum just over the commercial quantity. The remarks on sentence in relation to this were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Count 1: that the offender supplied not less than the commercial quantity of ecstasy. The amount supplied was 150 grams. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown relied on two acts of supply to make up this charge and which relate to two telephone conversations of the offender. In the first, on 14 March 2006 with a person referred to in the evidence as Junior and the other on 15 March 2006 with a person referred to as Ronnie.  
        
       
       
        
        In the conversation of 14 March, the offender offered to supply one hundred ecstasy tablets to Junior. What he said was that he would supply Junior with a ‘hunge’ of ‘lollies’. Evidence in the trial from a police officer who had expertise in drug terminology was that ‘lollies’ was a common reference to ecstasy and he said that a ‘hunge’ was reference to a hundred tablets. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown further relied on evidence of a drug analyst that the average weight of a tablet of ecstasy is .3 grams. A police officer with expertise in drug matters gave evidence that his experience is that the average weight of an ecstasy tablet is .25 grams. In this charge the Crown adopted the lower weight for the tablets. 
        
       
       
        
        In the conversation of 15 March, the offender told Ronnie that he had five hundred eccies which he was going out to deliver to someone who was waiting for him in Clyde Street. About forty minutes before the conversation between the offender and Ronnie the offender spoke to another of his associates and told him that he had five hundred and twenty-eight pills which he was counting and said that there should only have been five hundred. 
        
       
       
        
        The combination of these two supplies amount to 150 grams of ecstasy. The amount of ecstasy which comprises a commercial quantity for this drug is 125 grams”  
         
        
       
      
    73 It is clear that the judge was aware of the relevant circumstances establishing the offence. I see no error in the way her Honour dealt with the two acts of supply. 
     
      
       
      Sentence appeal - Ground 5 
       
       
      The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    74 Judicial Commission statistics were referred to which demonstrated that for offenders dealt with in the District Court for more than the commercial quantity 90 per cent of all offenders received a sentence of imprisonment, the 80 per cent range included sentences up to seven years and the 80 per cent range of non-parole periods included sentences up to three and a half years. 
     
      
    75 The point being made was that the eight years imprisonment was outside the 80 per cent range and four and a half years non-parole was outside the 80 per cent. 
     
      
    76 The appellant drew the Court’s attention to a number of what were said to be comparable cases: R v Chin [2003] NSWCCA 267; R v AMT [2005] NSWCCA 151; and Hutton v R [2008] NSWCCA 99. 
     
      
    77 In my view, the sentence was not manifestly excessive. The maximum penalty applicable was 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness as below the mid-range and the non-parole period determined reflected that, in particular having regard to the accumulation with an effective non-parole period of three and a half years. I do not find the cases relied upon truly comparable. In Chin the offender was much younger than the applicant; in AMT and Hutton the offenders were apparently couriers. Here, though the offence was found to fall below the mid range of objective seriousness, the appellant was as found by the sentencing judge “at the centre of a significant drug supply activity”. 
     
      
    78 In my view, the sentence was not manifestly excessive and no lesser sentence is warranted in law. 
     
      
    79 For the above reasons, the conviction appeal should be dismissed, leave to appeal against sentence be allowed and the appeal against sentence dismissed.

    JUDGMENT1. Craig Franklin graduated with BA Honours in philosophy in 1993. Ten years later he obtained his Master in Laws. The following year he graduated with a Diploma from the College of Law. He was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in June 2005. He set up his practice at Frederick Jordan Chambers. His arrival to the Bar was at the mature age of thirty-five. 2. Two years earlier he had met Tanya (not her real name) also a uni graduate working in human resources. A relationship developed; they shared accommodation. There were some tensions in the relationship. It took on some of the features of an “on-again-off-again” relationship with inappropriate behaviour coming from time to time from one party or the other. Some of that inappropriate behaviour within the relationship may well have had its origins in excessive alcohol consumption, at least so far as Franklin is concerned. 3. In the course of exploring the possibility of resuming the relationship, a weekend trip to the Canberra region was undertaken during Easter of 2007. During the course of this weekend Craig Franklin, who had never been in trouble with the law before, committed four criminal acts of violence upon Tanya. 4. He denied, and indeed still denies, he committed three of those acts. When arraigned in the Goulburn District Court in February of 2009 he pleaded not guilty to three indictable charges. After an eight-day trial the jury found him guilty of all three indictable offences. Today he is to be held accountable for those offences, together with the summary offence to which he earlier pleaded guilty. These offences reflect his criminal conduct during a twelve-hour period. 5. The charges are firstly on 9 April 2007 an assault upon “Tanya”; secondly, on the same date that he took the complainant without her consent and with the intent of obtaining an advantage; namely, sexual gratification, and thirdly that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent knowing that she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation; namely, that immediately before the commission of the offence he did occasion to her actual bodily harm. 6. As sentencing judge it falls to me to determine a number of competing tensions as I strive to find the appropriate sentence for these offences committed by this offender harming this victim in our community, Gladue v The Queen [1999] 1SCR 688 [80]. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender; that is, subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires me to make findings of fact from the evidence before the court relating to the offence and to the offender. My fact-finding task, at least in respect of the offence, necessarily requires me to find facts consistent with and reflective of the jury’s verdict. There is no obligation to find facts at either extreme of favourability or unfavourability to the accused.7. In this case the contested evidence only fell from one witness for either side. It is clear from the jury verdict that not only did the jury reject the accused’s evidence, but it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the complainant’s account; that is to say that it was both honest and accurate. That foundational finding by the jury should be reflected in my findings of fact. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. 8. There will be technical questions relating in particular to whether a standard non-parole period should apply; if not, whether special circumstances should be found; the matter on the Form 1 and finally, of course, the ultimate term of imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined; what weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus, the protection of the community, will also have need to be determined, see R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740. The FactsCount 1, the assault of complainant. 9. Franklin and Tanya had arrived at Rydges Eagle Hawk Resort about 8 April and had stayed overnight. The night of 8 April was a night where, so far as the court is concerned, nothing untoward occurred. The day of 9 April they spent viewing various places in Canberra. They returned after that to the Rydges Eagle Hawk Resort where they were staying. It is located on the New South Wales side of the ACT border. The couple had drunk at the restaurant; there was more drinking at the suite. In fairness to her, I should note the complainant was not as focused upon alcohol as was the accused; she had gone to bed at about 11pm. The accused continued to watch TV; sometime between 12.30 and 1 o’clock in the morning he came to bed. He made physical approaches to her consistent with indicating a desire for sexual activity. Her response was “No”. 10. From there matters deteriorated. He spoke dismissively to her; she told him to “fuck off”. There was ongoing abuse. She left the bedroom and used the sofa bed in the lounge room. He followed her. There were further exchanges. He returned to the bedroom in a heightened emotional state. She left the apartment to have a cigarette. He joined her. There were further heated words outside. He returned to the apartment. She followed shortly afterwards, returning to the sofa bed. He came to the bed saying further offensive things. I am satisfied she more than held her own in this heated discussion. He started to slap her several times, perhaps as many as five, to her face and head. She pushed him in the chest causing him to nearly lose balance. He began to leave but returned and resumed hitting her with an open hand. 11. The complainant estimates the whole episode lasted three minutes. If it lasted as long as that, most of it would have been occupied with verbal abuse. I do not accept the offender struck the complainant with an open hand more than say ten times. I am satisfied during this episode many disparaging and offensive comments were made by him towards her. I am satisfied when the criminal conduct happened Franklin was very well affected by alcohol, that he had consumed alcohol continuously since dinner, including the best part of two bottles post dinner. Count 2, the second charge, taking without consent with intent of obtaining advantage; namely, sexual gratification. 12. At the behest of the complainant the couple left the resort to return to Sydney early the following morning. As they travelled along the Federal Highway, Franklin was still abusive towards her. He struck her several times. One of his blows dislodged the lens from her glasses. They had not travelled far when he directed her to turn left off the highway. He directed her to pull over and in effect park the vehicle on the offside of the road so that it was pointing back towards the highway. She turned off the engine and lights. She was hit again and told, “Get in the back seat.” 13. The complainant’s assessment of the situation is important. She assessed that the accused now intended to drive. She was concerned at his capacity to do so because of what she believed was his high level of intoxication from the prior nights drinking. She said, “Please, Craig, no, you can’t drive.” It should be remembered that the vehicle they were using belonged to her. The offender responded, “Just get in the fucking back seat.” She took the keys from the ignition, escaped the car, snatched her handbag from the back seat and started running towards the highway. She had made some fifteen to twenty metres; she was grabbed, turned around and pulled towards the car. She said, “I’m sorry, I just don’t want you to drive.” He was striding quickly. When they reached the car he pushed her towards the driver’s side rear door; “Get in”, he said. She opened the door, he slammed the door behind her, then made his way to the passenger door, entered the car and began to strike her to the face and head with closed fists. She sought to protect herself with her arms and hands shielding her face. She raised her left foot against his chest. Franklin told her, “Move your fucking foot or I’m going to kill you.” Terrified she moved her foot. He demanded that she perform fellatio. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt when he ordered her into the back seat from the driver’s seat he had any sexual intent. Nor am I satisfied he had such an intent when he set off to capture her. But I am satisfied somewhere on the return journey of fifteen to twenty metres he formed the intent to have her fellate him and his forcing her into the back seat was for that purpose. The third count, sexual intercourse without consent knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation. 14. The offender undid the top button of his pants and undid his zipper. He lowered his pants enough to expose his penis which at that time was flaccid; he told her to suck it. She said, “I can’t, I can’t, I don’t have any saliva.” He replied, “I don’t care, just suck it. I don’t want any of that shit you did last time, just sucking on my knob, put my whole cock in your mouth.” The complainant suffers from a condition that causes her to have difficulty making saliva. The complainant was also told to wipe her nose. The offender gave her water from a bottle he had. 15. She performed oral sex. As his penis became more erect he told her “to put it in, to put it all in” and pushed the back of her head onto his penis. She was unable to accommodate him, gagged and had difficulty breathing. She was told to remove her hands from his penis, thus exposing more of his penis for her mouth. Her head was again pushed onto the penis. She was unable to breathe, she took her head from the penis, her body was shaking, her face was hurting. He told her a second time he was going to kill her; he punched her to the head. There was blood on his knuckles. He told her “Lick the blood off.” As she exposed her tongue he dragged his knuckles across her tongue. He told her to return to the driver’s seat. He returned to the passenger seat and the car was returned to its journey along the Federal Highway. Form 1 matter, assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 16. In respect of this matter the accused’s account is predicated upon a claim of no earlier offending conduct; the complainant’s account is predicated upon an account of several hours of ongoing violence. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the complainant’s account is correct. 17. On the return journey to Goulburn the complainant stopped at Anderson VC Reserve to obtain some water. Apparently there was none available but she retrieved some Coke from the car boot and gave it to the offender who was then sitting on the passenger side of the vehicle. She returned to the driver’s seat; there was further verbal abuse which graduated to physical abuse. Franklin smacked the complainant a number of times. This physical assault was accompanied by demeaning comments. As a consequence of the slapping there was bruising to the complainant’s face. Objective Criminality18. The most serious offence before the court is the charge of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation. The circumstance of aggravation occurs in the course of taking and detaining the complainant with the intention of obtaining advantage. Although the offence of take and detain for advantage was rendered slightly differently to the jury, than I have taken it on sentence, I am satisfied the jury must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that actual bodily harm was occasioned to the complainant before the commission of count 3. On more careful analysis, it is obvious the occasioning of actual bodily harm occurs as part of the taking and detaining offence; that is to say, the physical violence in addition to the sexual assault was not administered during the period covered by the sexual assault, that becomes obvious by virtue of the words of the charge. 19. The sexual assault was committed against the complainant by a person who had been in a domestic relationship with her. It was committed by one who had been sexually intimate with the complainant as part of that relationship, and indeed as recently as the prior night. Adams J speaking about domestic violence made comments that are well apposite to the present case. He noted in R v Dunn [2004] NSWCCA 41, a domestic violence case, two characteristics, the first being this:  
     
      
      “The offender usually believes that in a real sense what [he does is justified even that he is the true victim]”.  
      
      
    He made this further comment,  
     
      
      “That usually means that the victim never feels truly safe as a consequence, at least in any ongoing relationship.”  
      
      
       
      
    20. This offence constitutes a monumental exploitation of the offender’s physical power and dominance over a physically weaker human being. That unlawful exercise of physical power and dominance, at least so far as the sexual assault offence is concerned, began when he grabbed the complainant and physically dragged his ever-reluctant companion to the back seat of the vehicle. There was a callousness demonstrated by him in the unusual circumstances of this case. Her mouth was dry and her capacity to produce saliva was impaired. Water from a bottle was a most unsympathetic and ineffectual solution. Twice he forced his erect penis in beyond any comfort zone; indeed, to a point where she gagged and had difficulty breathing. The offender used the occasion to demean and humiliate the complainant. 21. Professor Starmer puts Franklin’s blood alcohol content somewhere between 0.124 and 0.267 millilitres per 100 millilitres of blood during the period 5.30 to 6am. Some support for a high reading is to be found in the complainant's evidence. It is to be remembered she was concerned that he was too drunk to drive when the car was first pulled over. Necessarily, there will be a lack of precision as to the degree of inebriation. Necessarily, the degree to which his cognitive abilities, demeanour, verbal responses, emotional ability and inappropriate aggression levels were impacted will also lack precision. Nonetheless, against a background of no other violence against women I am prepared to find all of these were significantly impaired during the period of his offending in and around the motor vehicle. 22. The take and detain offence was an offence that began when Franklin first began to return the complainant to her car and must have ended when she commenced to drive on. This is an offence that results in her being accessible and available for the sexual gratification. But the criminality of the 61J offence is limited to the period of time commencing after the actual bodily harm had been committed until she begins to drive on. 23. The Crown sought to argue the complainant was vulnerable. Necessarily, the nature of this offence is one whereby virtue of power imbalance an offender has his way with the victim; that is, exploits the vulnerability of the physically weaker victim. That is this case. But the complainant was not vulnerable in the sense of being physically fragile, such as the aged or physically disabled. Nor was she impaired by drug or alcohol or any mental condition. I do not regard the vulnerability that existed in being alone and physically weaker as constituting the sort of vulnerability captured in s 21A(2)(l) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 24. Within a relationship that had been ongoing for three years, albeit with ups and downs, sexual intimacy, as experienced in the relationship, will necessarily mean the complainant was aware of and usually would have experienced the various sexual practices that excite the offender. That being so, the varying degrees of intimacy achieved within the experience of a normal sexual relationship by oral, vaginal and, if it be the case, anal penetration have less impact than they might have in cases where the offender and victim are strangers. It is not open to the defence to argue, nor as I recall did it seek to do so, that oral intercourse is less serious than penile- vaginal or penile- anal intercourse. 25. The parties drew my attention after submissions had been completed sometime last week to a Court of Criminal Appeal decision Alseedi v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 185. In this case a passage from the remarks on sentence by Berman DCJ were referred to. His Honour said:  
     
      
      “I am satisfied the appropriate way of looking at the various forms of sexual intercourse is not to apply blanket determinations that one form is always more serious than another, but to look at all the circumstances in which the particular form of intercourse occurs. Thus, for example, while it may be thought that digital penetration will usually be less serious than other forms of sexual intercourse, that would not automatically be the case. In order to decide the seriousness of a particular act of intercourse much more needs to be looked at than the form of the intercourse.” 
       
       
      
    26. To his Honour’s remarks I would also add “although clearly the form of intercourse will necessarily be one of the matters taken into account”. Giles JA, Hidden and McCallum JJ agreeing, observed in respect of Berman DCJ’s remarks (absent my addendum), 
     
      
      “...the judge was correct to have regard to the circumstances of the particular offence rather than place the form of sexual intercourse in some kind of hierarchy. Forced fellatio is quite capable of achieving or exceeding the midpoint of objective seriousness. The physical force used by the appellant cannot correctly be described as minimal and failure to persist when he appeared to have achieved his objective of stimulation did not lessen the seriousness of the offence...” 
      
    at para 61. 27. This offence demonstrates a violent instance of penile oral intercourse. For the purposes of assessing the criminality of the sexual assault offence, I take into account adverse to the accused that it was done in course of criminal conduct, namely the taking of the complainant against her will back to the car. I also take into account that the offence was committed in the context of earlier assaults reaching back to the early hours of the morning. During the period of sexual assault his conversation was markedly aggressive culminating in a threat to kill her. The impact upon her was such as to terrify her; her body was shaking. The humiliation of her included having him wipe his bleeding knuckles clean against her outstretched tongue. I do not aggravate the offence on the account of the objective criminality of the two other offences I have just referred to. Each must be separately assessed and weighed when the question of totality comes into play its part in the sentencing outcome, but it is appropriate to have regard to the context in which this offence was committed.28. The Crown submitted the offence fell just above a midrange of seriousness. The starting point is the hotel room where the violence started. That violence was not violence to achieve the particular sexual assault that attracted the standard non-parole period. Indeed, the particular sexual assault was not even contemplated at that stage on anyone’s case. 29. While those background circumstances may be taken into account, as I have indicated in context as matters that may aggravate the offending, it is important to recognise the parameters of the 61J offence. For example, the Crown submitted that it was clearly the offender had the intent of using an isolated location for sexual purposes when he ordered the complainant off the Federal Highway. While I can accept the possibility that that may well be so, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that. 30. Where a couple had been arguing and violence has been displayed, and given the early hour of the morning and his drunken condition, there may well be other explanations equally feasible. For my part I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at some time when he was returning the complainant to the car, he had an intent to sexually assault her. I do not rule out that he was aroused in some way by the struggle between the complainant and he on the return to the car when she bolted. I am satisfied the isolation, the use of force upon a non-compliant female and the availability of a back seat were factors that manufactured an intent to sexually abuse her. 31. Again, this finding impacts upon the criminality. Had he chased after her for the purpose of having sexual intercourse, the offence would have been more serious; had he left the highway for that purpose, it would have been more serious still. His chasing after her may well have been because it was her car, because he was in no fit state to drive or because he was wanting to return to Sydney at that point. 32. The use of threat to kill and violence towards the complainant at the car for the purposes of having sexual intercourse are aggravating features. True, they establish an essential element that he knew she was not consenting, but they go beyond that to aggravate the violent nature of the non-consensual intercourse. 33. Given the parameters of the offence, I have found they do not extend to the boundaries the Crown sought in its submissions. The Crown defines the offence more expansively than do I. That may account for the difference in my view of the criminality. Nonetheless, my finding is the offence on its objective circumstances falls marginally above the lower border of the midrange of seriousness. That is to say it is within the midrange of seriousness but close to the lower rung of that midrange. The Victim Impact Statement34. I have received a victim impact statement. The material contained in the victim impact statement is not sworn evidence and has not been subject to cross-examination. To the extent that opinions are expressed in the statement I recognise they are not opinions of a qualified expert. The victim impact statement coming as it does from the primary victim may if I accept it as reliable, provide unsworn evidence as to facts of the offences and their effect upon her. 35. The functions of statements such as this is firstly to give victims an opportunity of having their voice heard in sentencing proceedings by publicly identifying the impact of the trauma visited upon them by the actions of an offender. Secondly, it enables sentencing proceedings to assist victims as they move towards some closure of grief, resentment and brooding arising from the criminal conduct of an offender. Thirdly, a victim impact statement may contribute to an offender at least hearing firsthand and perhaps gaining insight into the impact his offending conduct had upon her. Finally, the victim impact statement keeps this court mindful of the impact crimes have upon the ordinary men and women who are its victims. 36. The complainant says this: Physical injuries, impact on health and medical treatment, and a series of bullet points.  
     
      
      Due to head injuries I suffered I had a great amount of difficulty in lying in any position that did not cause pain and therefore I had trouble sleeping. 
      I underwent a number of tests including CAT scans and X-rays to determine whether any permanent head damage had occurred, in addition to requiring eye tests and new glasses.  
      I was unable to open my mouth for a period of time which prevented me eating and talking normally.  
      I have been receiving ongoing chiropractic treatment as a result of the constant tension I hold my body in since the event. 
      I had stress-related tonsillitis which caused me to be taken to an emergency room on one occasion prior to undergoing tonsillectomy operation in October 2008.  
      I continue to experience loss of energy and motivation and lack of interest in daily life and goals and I now take antidepressant medication which I did not do prior to the event. 
      I frequently suffer with insomnia and I have been prescribed sleeping tablets, while other times I suffer with oversleeping and not taking any sleeping tablets. 
      I regularly see my GP regarding depression. 
      
    37. I pause here to note that in respect of requiring new glasses and in respect of undergoing a tonsillectomy operation in October; my view is in the absence of expert evidence relating those causally to this event, I will not be taking them into account. Emotional impact: 
     
      
      Increased anger 
      Heightened irritability 
      Amplified impatience 
      My ability to deal with small level stressful situations was diminished even though I thrived on this before the event. 
      My temper is shorter and I am much, much less tolerant of situations I would have easily tolerated before. 
      I suffer with a diminished level of self esteem which affects my general thinking and behaviour. 
      Even though I can rationally explain most outcomes I often revert to self blame. 
      I experience heightened irritability to cope with every day stresses while previously I handled these situations without difficulty, I have since struggled with these things. 
      My outlook even as perceived by those closest to me is often that of general apathy. 
      Since the event my attitude has of times been one of defiance, this can make both social and work situations difficult as I do not wish to compromise. 
      
    Psychological and mental health impact: 
     
      
      A counsellor has advised me that I suffer with post traumatic stress disorder. Some of the symptoms I display include hyper vigilance, looking around on the streets or cars at number plates in fear of seeing him. I suffer with ongoing nightmares and flashbacks. 
      Medically I have been diagnosed with depression. Some of the symptoms include flatness of mood. I find it difficult to leave the house at times. 
      I lack motivation in general. I have poor focus and concentration and I am constantly fatigued and lethargic and suffer with both insomnia and oversleeping. I did not suffer with these symptoms prior to the event 
      From the optimistic person I have always been since the event I have become cynical and often pessimistic. 
      While I previously always looked for good in people I have become less trusting and I’m looking for reasons that they are being deceitful. 
      I express irritability at dealing with everyday situations and easily feel stretched. 
      
    Changes in normal coping skills:  
     
      
      My ability to concentrate on tasks has been severely compromised. 
      I have great difficulty and of times am unable to handle stressful situations and conflict. 
      My self doubt and constant questioning of my own ability to make decisions often results in inactivity. This is completely the opposite of how I coped previously. 
      Since the event I have lost interest in daily life and regular activities. Again this is completely the opposite of how I behaved previously. 
      
    Changes in social life and impact on relationships with others: 
     
      
      Due to my significant issues with trust as a result of the event I endure great difficulty in building and maintaining new relationships and suffer even more so with intimacy. 
      Even with existing relationships with family and friends I have become more detached. Previously I enjoyed being physically and emotionally close with others while I now generally keep people at distance. 
      I do not gain the same level of joy from social interactions as I did prior to this event. Whereas before I would go out of my way to get to many social functions I now select few to go to. 
      Although I previously held many close relationships and enjoyed empathising and spending time with others I have been less emotionally available and possess very low tolerance in general. 
      I now avoid sitting in the back seat of any car. 
      
    And her final heading is, Impact on financial situation and employment: 
     
      
       Prior to the event I demonstrated sharpness and clarity of mind. I was confident, driven and successful at work. I would often travel alone around Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia. Since the event I refuse to travel alone. My thinking has slowed and it is not sequential. I have lost confidence in myself, am not motivated, and lack direction which makes it very difficult to carry out work. 
      Prior to the event I constantly exceeded targets. Since then I have not even gotten close to reaching targets which has resulted not only in terrible financial loss but caused me to have my job threatened regularly thereby continuing to escalate my stress levels. 
      While I initially tried to continue with full time employment, the difficulty in getting out of bed, the diminished standard and quality of my work, and my lack of ability to focus, concentrate, make decisions, be responsive as required plus my suffering intrusive symptoms such as flash backs resulted in my attempting to work in a part time capacity. Due to these continuing issues and inability to handle the stress of even reduced every day work life I have stopped working altogether. This has severe financial implications. 
      
    Subjective Matters, Family Dynamics, Personal Background and Relationships38. Craig Franklin is a 42 year old expectant father with his new partner, Emma Burke. He and Burke met at an AA meeting during the course of each undergoing rehabilitation from alcoholism. He is the eldest of four siblings, two sons, two daughters. His parents are still alive. The family appear relatively close knit with the youngest son, father (Garry), daughter (Danielle), and now the offender all involved in the youngest son Trent’s family business, Enziron Insurance Solutions. The appointment to the family firm must have been relatively recently. More importantly however, it will be available to him upon release from custody. All family members, particularly the siblings, present as high achievers. 39. Emma Burke and the offender appear to have met about mid 2008. Within three months they were residing together at Franklin’s family home and more recently living independently in a rented accommodation. Their first child is expected in January of 2010. There is no history of domestic violence between her and the offender. 40. His first relationship commenced when he was twenty-one and lasted ten years. There was no domestic violence in that relationship. There was a second relationship in 1997 that lasted sixteen months with a solicitor. Again no violence. 41. The third long term relationship was with the complainant. That relationship commenced about 2003 and ended with the matters before the court in 2007. But for the events at Easter 2007 there has been no history of domestic violence in any of his prior relationships. Education, Skills and Employment42. Franklin obtained a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) Sydney University 2003, LlM 2002, Graduate Diploma in Law 2003, admitted initially as a solicitor and subsequently admitted in May 2005 as a Barrister practising, as I said, out of Frederick Jordan Chambers. So far as I can recall there was no work history of any significance prior to his legal practice. Even so it is likely the offender will settle into the family business. 43. I should note that it is likely the Bar Association will ensure the offender does not practise law, as least as a Barrister, in the foreseeable future. He has already taken his name from the roll of practising barristers and has not sought to practise since the allegations were first ventilated against him. By virtue of his actions he now fails to meet the criteria of “fit and proper person” necessary to practise law as a barrister. His exclusion from the profession is said to constitute extra curial punishment. That appears to me a valid argument. The Crown has not sought to be heard against him. No matter how he should rehabilitate, nor that he serves his sentence, the door to his practising will remains closed for the foreseeable future, see in re Davis (1947) 75 CLR 409 at 416-417; per Latham CJ; ex parte Davis (1962) 63 SR (NSW) 54. General Health44. The offender’s physical health does not appear to present him with any problems. He is probably overweight. During his period of heavy alcoholism his liver was under stress; but since he began abstaining it has recovered. 45. As a child he stuttered which caused numerous issues for him (see later). That stutter appears to have resolved itself or become so harnessed into his speech patterns that it is hardly noticeable. He has given evidence before the jury, and again before me on sentence. He presents as articulate and fluent in his replies to questions.Mental Health46. Franklin’s father says that he first became aware in Franklin’s early twenties that his son was stricken by the blight of extreme anxiety which progressively developed into clinical depression. Over the last twenty years he has lived for long periods in the family home, at times living in a darkened room under covers for twenty-four hours continuous, for weeks, with minimal food and no interest in accessing help. That is not to say Franklin has not sought help in the past for his anxiety and depression. In 2002-2003 and again it seems in 2006 he has seen psychiatrists who have prescribed varying forms of ante-depressants.47. During his recovery period from alcoholism in 2008 he was assisted by Dr Glenys Dore, consultant psychologist and a clinical doctor from North Sydney Drug and Alcohol Service and Dr Noeleen Latt a drug and alcohol physician. Dr Dore’s overview of his history was that Franklin had a long history of recurrent episodes of Major Depressive Disorder with onset in childhood when he was having difficulties with stuttering. Dr Westmore, gives the most recent diagnosis obtained for the defence, AXIS 1, alcohol abuse in remission; depression, in remission. It is probable he has suffered reactive depression known as adjustment disorder. He was not suffering depression at the time of conferring with Dr Westmore.Character48. This offender is one of four high achieving children. He has battled since his twenties with depression. He overcame his stuttering. He was probably affected during his school years with social anxiety, perhaps even subsequent. Even though he repeated a year or more at school he chose to study Law having obtained an honours level, Bachelor of Arts degree. He was admitted to the Bar in 2005 and was beginning to establish his practice in Law. Until these offences he was regarded as a “fit and proper person” to practise law. A standard of character deliberately demandingly high for the protection of the profession. 49. There are no criminal convictions. I am satisfied his conduct over Easter was entirely out of character for him. There seems little doubt the relationship with the complainant presented problems for him. Having committed the offences he immediately set about dealing with the areas of his behaviour and personality profile that contributed to his offending conduct. He is to be commended for that.Rehabilitation Prospects50. The Probation and Parole Service obtained a report from the Department of Corrective Services Forensic Psychology Services who reviewed Franklin for the purposes of assessing his risk of re-offending sexually. In a very thorough and detailed report Craig Baird assessed him at low risk of re-offending. Given the offender’s commitment to alcohol rehabilitation and dealing with depression and other personality profile type problems I am satisfied on all material before me, including Mr Baird’s report, that Franklin’s risk of re-offending is low to negligible. I should also note he attended and completed a relationships course entitled “Taking Responsibility”; that course lasting for some six months. Attitude to Offence51. Franklin admitted occasioning actual bodily harm to the complainant. That admission may well have been sincere. On the other hand the circumstances of his arrest and the presentation of the complainant at that time made any course other than a frank admission difficult for him in the extreme. He has, however, denied, and still denies, the earlier assault at the motel, the detaining and sexual intercourse offences. In respect of these offences he cannot claim contrition. He does say he is genuinely sorry for the assault occasion actual bodily harm- s 166 offence and will be given credit for that contrition when sentenced for this offence. 52. Co-incidentally I noted, I think in Alseedi [2009] NSWCCA 185, that that appeal turned upon a proposition that there can be rehabilitation without confession and offenders found guilty after trial are not all but automatically deprived of a finding of good prospects on rehabilitation, when they acknowledge their guilt. For my own part I have sought to give emphasis to that in any event. But I also take a view that sometimes publicly claimed contrition may be missing when silent, or contrition sub silentio, is really being experienced. I have not ruled that out as a possibility in this case.Totality53. All of this offending conduct has been captured by four charges. Three on indictment and one being dealt with pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The criminality takes place over a period of less than twelve hours. Of course that is substantially longer than other episodes of ongoing criminal conduct the courts frequently deal with when dealing with multiple charges. An example close at hand is Alseedi. However, concurrent sentences would reflect the closeness in time of the offending conduct and the impact of alcohol consumption that helped cause it. The sentence for the sexual assault, while still reflecting its criminality, will be weighted somewhat to reflect the total criminality. The standard non-parole period does not apply. 54. The aggravated sexual intercourse offence carries a standard non-parole period of seven years. That applies to an offence falling within the mid range of seriousness. I have assessed this offence as falling just within the mid range. On that basis the offence would attract a standard non-parole period. There are though, three other bases that would excuse the offence from a standard non-parole period. The offender’s prior good character, including no record for similar offences. His highly assessed rehabilitation prospects would also have the effect of bringing the sentence outside the requirement of a standard non-parole period, if I understand the reasoning in Way (R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168) correctly. 55. If I have understood Way, it holds that the effect of s 54D of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is to pose a question: “Are there any reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period?” That question is answered first by a consideration of the objective seriousness of the offence considered in the light of the factors which relate directly to the commission of the offence, and secondly by a consideration of the circumstances of aggravation and mitigation in this case which applied to this offender as set out in s 21A(2) and s 21A(3). Consideration in either or both of the categories may provide justification for departure from the standard non-parole period as otherwise required by s 54B. 56. In the light of the three matters which I have mentioned and in my view should be given substantial weight at sentencing proceedings, I have determined that the standard non-parole period will not apply. Nonetheless the standard non-parole period remains an important reference point even where the standard non-parole period does not apply. Mulatto v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [20] per Spigelmann CJs, Simpson agreeing. Setting the Sentence57. In setting the sentence I regard the total objective criminality of Franklin’s offending as greater than Alsidee’s. I regard Franklin’s subjective features as being more favourable than Alsidee’s. I noticed the sentence imposed on Alsidee by the Court of Criminal Appeal when determining his appeal against severity was an overall sentence of seven years with a four-year non-parole period. That sentence was not meant to be a benchmark but an expression of the exercise of the Court of Criminal Appeal’s judgment and discretion. Of course I would take proper notice of that Court’s reasons and the result of those reasons as expressed in the sentencing discretion. 58. The maximum penalties available are the assault two years, the detain fourteen years, the aggravated sexual assault without consent 20 years and the assault occasioning actual bodily harm when treated summarily I have two years but I am not confident of it.FOX: It is two years if it could be dealt with summarily Your Honour - did note earlier that the standard non-parole for the aggravated sexual intercourse was seven years, my understanding is ten.HIS HONOUR: Ten--FOX: The offence of sexual intercourse without consent is seven--HIS HONOUR: Wait a minute. Let me have a look at it. I thought I read somewhere seven, that is why I put it down. You are right. Aggravated sexual assault ten years standard non-parole period. Thanks for that.59. It should be noted that my attention has just been drawn to my references of a seven year standard non-parole period as being incorrect and I am advised, and in fact have confirmed, the standard non-parole period for this offence, that is the aggravated sexual intercourse offence, is one of ten years. 60. Finding special circumstances this is an appropriate case to find special circumstances. Dr Westmore, an experienced forensic psychiatrist well versed in prison culture makes the following point in his report,  
     
      
      “Obviously incarceration will be very difficult for this man. I note at his age his educational and professional background and the nature of the offence itself. All of these factors will make him a prisoner at risk. He does not have an anti-social personality disorder, despite the nature of the matters before the court, and that will also separate him from a large part of the prison population and make him more vulnerable.” 
       
      
    61. I also note his child will be born in the first few months of his incarceration. Having a first born child the community at a time when he is excluded from it will make his custody the harder. That is a matter that I have taken into account in fixing special circumstances rather than in otherwise mitigating the penalty. Finally, his rehabilitation is best achieved in the community. There was a fourth reason, which I have in my notes here, in finding special circumstances and it was that this was his first time in custody. 62. It will be seen from the sentences that I impose that I have rejected Mr Barker of Queen’s Counsel's submission of a suspended sentence. When counsel as eminent as Mr Barker makes a submission it must be seriously considered. However, the criminality exhibited in the major offence and the impact of legislative intent in the introduction of standard non-parole periods are forces so strong as to make that submission of Mr Barker unworkable even with prior good character, strong family support, and most impressive rehabilitation progress. 63. Would you stand up please Mr Franklin?64. Craig Franklin I convict you of the offence that you on or about 9 April at Sutton in the state of New South Wales did assault the complainant. For that offence I set a sentence of three months to date from today’s date 18 September 2009 and to expire on 12 December 2009. 65. I also convict you that on 9 April 2007 at Sutton you took the complainant without her consent and with intent of obtaining an advantage, namely sexual gratification. In respect of that sentence I set a fixed term of twenty-four months imprisonment to date from today 18 September 2009 and to expire on 17 September 2011.66. I likewise convict you that on 9 April 2007 at Sutton the same time and place you had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation namely that immediately before the commission of that offence you did occasion actual bodily harm to her. For that offence I set a non-parole period of four and a half years to date from 18 September 2009 and to expire on 17 March 2014. I set a balance of term of three years to expire on 17 March 2017. 67. In respect of the 166 matter I set a sentence of six months to commence on 18 September 2009 and to expire on 17 March 2010. Please sit down. I must tell you that I cannot order your parole or your release, the Parole Board will do that. They will only do that in circumstances where they are satisfied that it is safe to release you, and it is safe for you to be released, that is your own health will not be undermined by you being released. You can best achieve that particularly by doing a sex offender’s program. It will be a matter entirely for you what you do but I have been around for a while and you may think there is some value to that, it’s a matter for you.You may say goodbye to your family before I remit you to the custody of the custodial officers. Would you go into the dock now please. Is there any other order Mr Crown?FOX: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Is there any other order Mr Kintominas?KINTOMINAS: No, your Honour. Sorry, a moment your Honour. Your Honour, I don’t know in the form of an order as such but It occasionally happens that prisoners are at slightly more risk in the first twenty-four hours or forty-eight hours before the gaol authorities assess the situation. If there’s any recommendation that your Honour can make to ensure it’s safe.HIS HONOUR: I recommend the urgent classification of this offender by the custodial authorities and I recommend that caution be taken in placing him anywhere in the interim on account of his profession, or past profession.KINTOMINAS: Thank you, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: He should not be placed in protective custody unless he requests it, incidentally.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender has pleaded guilty to one count of murder. The offence occurred on 21 May 2008. It carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of 20 years. 
     
      
    2 On the day of the offence the offender and a friend called Thomas Smith aka Thomas Dargan met in Redfern. Throughout the day they drank some alcohol and smoked “ice” (methylamphetamine hydrochloride) on 4 separate occasions and consumed some cannabis. According to Thomas Smith the offender may have consumed about $500 worth of “ice”, $400 worth of cannabis and a bottle of Bourbon. However, it is not possible to make a reliable determination of the actual amounts consumed, although they could properly be described as not insignificant. 
     
      
    3 In the evening the offender and Thomas Smith went to a party at a house at 11 Vine Street in Redfern. There were numerous other people at the party including the deceased, William Campbell.  
     
      
    4 Sometime between 10.30 pm and midnight the offender and the deceased had a heated argument in the kitchen of the house. During that argument the offender took a knife resembling a steak knife from a kitchen drawer. Another person at the house tried to convince the offender not to take the knife and said “put the knife down, don’t stab him.” Other persons also urged the offender to put the knife down.  
     
      
    5 Sometime later the deceased went outside and called upon the offender to come out to fight. The offender was described by one witness as being in the kitchen and “schizzing out trying to look for a knife.” The offender then armed with a knife which he had taken from the kitchen ran outside to the front of the house and said “who wants a go?” One witness described the offender as he jumped the back fence as “going out schiz.” 
     
      
    6 At the time the offender was leaving the house Thomas Smith and a friend of the deceased were punching each other in the street. The deceased was holding a metal scooter above his head as a weapon and was ready to swing it. There is a suggestion that the deceased may have been using the scooter to stop members of the crowd joining the fight against his friend. The offender ran towards the deceased and yelled “that’s a dog act you know.” Members of the crowd were calling out encouraging those fighting. The offender then “rushed” the deceased and stabbed him. At the time he was stabbed it is unclear whether the deceased had put the scooter down. The stabbing comprised a single wound to the right hand side of the deceased’s chest. The deceased fell to the ground moments after he was stabbed. Some of the other persons present called for the assistance of ambulance officers but although they arrived they were unable to save the deceased. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. 
     
      
    7 Following the stabbing the offender ran away. However, at around 11.25 am the following day, the offender voluntarily attended the Parramatta police station. A short time later he was arrested for murder. He declined to participate in an interview. 
     
      
    8 It is the Crown case that by stabbing the deceased the offender committed an unlawful act which was done with the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    9 I am satisfied to the relevant standard that the offender’s actions were impulsive, unplanned and were committed at a time when he was affected by the methylamphetamine which he had ingested. The offence resulted from a single stab wound. The offender did not have the intention to kill but intended to inflict grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    10 The offender is an Aboriginal and identifies with the Aboriginal community living in an area known as “the block” at Redfern. At the time of the offence he was aged 18 years 7 weeks. He is the only child to his parents but has five half siblings. His mother was brought up in Sydney but most of her family were from the north coast of New South Wales. Although the offender spent his early life in Sydney he has also lived at Kempsey, Lismore and Walgett. 
     
      
    11 The offender attended school until the end of primary school. His mother succumbed to substance abuse and he became a State ward and was placed in foster care. He has lived on the streets from time to time from the age of 8. He first came to the attention of the authorities at the age of 10 when he stole food and clothes. The offender has been in juvenile justice centres from the age of 15 including Baxter, Kariong, Reiby, in the Riverina and at Grafton. He had learning difficulties at school and has limited reading skills. Although he had formed one relationship his girlfriend terminated it after his arrest. 
     
      
    12 The offender was examined by Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist who found him to be suffering from a “conduct disorder” primarily because of his criminal convictions from the age of 10 which have resulted in long periods in custody. He was diagnosed as a person who engages in substance abuse and who has a craving for drugs.  
     
      
    13 The offender was also examined by Professor Starmer, a consultant pharmacologist. Professor Starmer describes a particularly severe form of methylamphetamine abuse referred to as a “speed run” in which the user repeatedly administers the drug over a number of days. Apparently tolerance develops quickly and the dose needs to be progressively increased. Towards the end of “the run” dysphoria and in some cases psychosis may develop. There is the possibility that the user may become violent and dangerous. When examined by Dr Nielssen the offender reported persecutory beliefs after periods of continuous use of amphetamine in the past. It is the opinion of both Professor Starmer and Dr Nielssen that the ingestion of amphetamine by the offender would have been likely to have increased his fear and perception of threat which contributed to the response he made to the deceased. However, Dr Nielssen does not believe that apart from some damage to his brain from the abuse of alcohol and other solvents in childhood the offender has a mental illness or underlying mental disease or condition. 
     
      
    14 The offender has a criminal record which includes offences of violence including common assault and assaulting a law enforcement officer, not police. He also has convictions for motorcar offences including taking and driving a conveyance and driving in a manner dangerous. The offender acknowledged that at the time of the offence he was on conditional release for an offence of stealing property in a dwelling. Although the driving offences are of no significance in relation to the present matter, the other offences, and in particular the fact that he was on conditional release at the time of the offence is.  
     
      
    15 The present offence was committed two months into a six month period of supervision. In submissions his counsel acknowledged that reference to his record indicated that the offender has displayed an attitude of disobedience to the law. It was accepted that he should be sentenced on the basis that the commission of the offence while on conditional liberty is an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    16 The offender pleaded guilty but only on the first day of his trial. However, the plea was entered in a context where he voluntarily admitted to the police that he was responsible for the death. The delay was at least in part due to the necessity for the defence to have him psychiatrically examined and give advice as to the options available to him. Although he voluntarily admitted that he was responsible for the death there were many witnesses to the event and his detection would have been inevitable. I will provide a discount of 15% for his plea of guilty. 
     
      
    17 The offender has not given evidence before me. Although he has expressed regret about the fight to Dr Nielssen I have little evidence that he is remorseful. 
     
      
    18 Although the offender has pleaded guilty the standard non-parole period is relevant as a “guide post”. The Crown conceded that the case falls below the mid range of objective seriousness. By reason of the fact that the offence was a single, impulsive stab wound inflicted without the intention of killing the victim I am satisfied that this concession was correctly made.  
     
      
    19 However, determination of the objective seriousness of the offence must recognise that the offence involved the actual use of a weapon. There was also a child present, who was 16 years of age, and saw the stabbing occur. To my mind the offence was moderately below the mid range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    20 I have already referred to the fact that the offender was aged 18 at the time of the offence. It is apparent that although he had reached that age he is immature and has many difficulties. The deprivations of his childhood and lack of parental guidance have put him on a path where he lacks the skills which are necessary to function as a responsible member of the community. His substance abuse is significant and there is a danger that it may completely overwhelm his life.  
     
      
    21 The offender’s counsel submitted that because the offender is an Aboriginal I should adopt the approach taken by Wood J (as he then was) in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. Although the offender’s upbringing was seriously inadequate he has not suffered the deprivations which Wood J identified. In Ceissman v R (2001) 119 A Crim R 535 Wood CJ at CL made plain that Fernando was not a decision justifying special leniency merely because of the aboriginality of the offender. Sentencing principles are non discriminatory and are to be applied to all offenders irrespective of their particular racial or ethnic group (see Andrews v R (2007) NSWCCA 68 per McClellan CJ at CL at [21]). 
     
      
    22 The victim’s mother, Ms Vivienne (Kate) Campbell has provided a victim impact statement. She gives a moving account of the terrible loss which she has felt from her son’s death. It has affected all members of the family. On behalf of the court I express my deepest sympathy for those who have suffered through this loss. I have had regard to the statement in the manner provided by the relevant legislation. 
     
      
    23 The sentencing of the offender is made complex by reason of his youth and the role of illegal drugs in his behaviour and its impact upon him at the time of the offence. However, the decision to ingest illegal drugs was voluntarily made and accordingly cannot be considered as a mitigating factor when sentencing. 
     
      
    24 I am mindful of the fact that the offender is a young person. Although there must be considerable doubt as to whether he will be able to retrieve his life and upon release assume a responsible place in the community I do not believe all hope has been lost. Dr Nielssen is of the opinion that he has not yet come to understand the nature and extent of his drug abuse problems and is uncertain whether he will ever achieve an understanding of these issues. If he does not it will be most unlikely that he is able to turn his life around. Nevertheless I find that there remains some prospect of his rehabilitation. 
     
      
    25 Because the offence was committed while he was on conditional liberty which expired on 24 September 2008 I propose to date his sentence from 25 September of that year. The sentence I have in mind will prospectively allow a period of four years for his release on parole. Although the offender will require careful supervision and assistance on his release from custody this should provide an appropriate period to allow for the necessary adjustments to be made.

      REASONS FOR JUDGMENT - On application to discharge the jury – Publicity in an overseas terrorist trial – Whether a real risk of miscarriage of justice – test of necessity – Jurors’ adherence to directions 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 11 September 2009 I declined to discharge the jury in the present trial. There had been an application to discharge made the previous afternoon. The principal arguments were advanced by Mr Button SC on behalf of his client, Moustafa Cheikho. Three of the other accused (Mr Elomar abstaining) supported the arguments advanced by Mr Button. These are my reasons for decision. 
     
      
    2 There were media reports on Tuesday, 8 September 2009 that a British Court had convicted three men in connection with a plot to blow up a number of transatlantic airliners flying between London and the United States and Canada. There is, of course, no connection whatsoever between the accused in the present trial and those three men. It seems that the jury in the English trial acquitted four other men, also on trial and charged with the same offence. The jury had failed to reach a verdict on an eighth man. 
     
      
    3 I shall quote from selected parts of Exhibit “A”. This is a collection of articles taken from online media reports. 
     
      
    News.com.au said:- 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Prosecutors had alleged that eight Islamic fundamentalists, who aimed to cause death on an unimaginable scale, were directed by masterminds overseas to take bombs disguised as soft drinks on to US and Canada bound planes. The plan involved mixing hydrogen peroxide with food colouring and a powdered soft drink before injecting the mixture into the bottom of soft drink bottles. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        Refilled batteries would carry the chemical detonator with the bombs being set off using a charge from a light bulb filament. According to prosecutors, the group had planned to smuggle the bombs aboard flights bound for Montreal and Toronto in Canada and San Francisco, Washington, New York and Chicago in the United States.” 
        
       
      
    4 The World Today (a current affairs programme broadcast by ABC Local Radio and Radio National) broadcast and placed on the net the following:- 
     
      
       
        
        “UK authorities say the conviction of three British men for conspiring to detonate bombs on transatlantic flights is hugely significant. The British Home Secretary said the liquid explosives plot could have killed thousands of people and caused mayhem on an unimaginable scale. The arrests of the men three years ago prompted a tightening of security at international airports worldwide."" 
        
       
      
    5 A subsequent ABC report by Barbara Miller repeated that the plan had been to manufacture liquid explosives using hydrogen peroxide, disguised in drink bottles. The plan was to detonate the bombs in midair on at least seven planes from London to North America. An explosive expert was interviewed who confirmed the seriousness of the effect of the proposed explosion. There were also interviews from London which indicated that witnesses had heard test explosions occurring in their locality in a wood outside London. There was also reference to a suicide video from one of the accused who had said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Osama warned you many times to leave our land or you will be destroyed. And now the time has come for you to be destroyed.” 
        
       
      
    6 The broadcast also had a voice over which purported to repeat an excerpt from an e-mail that had come from Pakistan in July of 2006 to one of the three accused. The e-mail said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Hi, gorgeous! Well, nice to hear from you. Your friend can go for his rapping concert rehearsal but somewhat popular would be good. Make sure he goes on the bus service which is most common over there.” 
        
       
      
      
    7 The radio commentator said the prosecution had argued that this meant the people in Pakistan had given the go ahead for a dummy run to test airport security, and that common bus service meant domestic carrier. 
     
      
    8 There was another e-mail which said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Hi. Got some good news that will bring a smile to your face. I have 15 suppliers to give Calvin Klein aftershave. One box of 50 is only ₤175.” 
        
       
      
    9 The commentator said that the prosecution had argued that this was a code for the hydrogen peroxide to be used in the explosives.  
     
      
    10 The third download relied upon by the accused in support of the present discharge application was one from yahoo.com containing a report by Alice Ritchie of AAP. This was to the same effect as those I have mentioned above. It also mentioned, however, that Woolwich Crown Court heard that the plot was drawn up in Pakistan and passed on to Ali (one of the London accused) who returned to Britain ""to assemble a terror cell, gather material and identify targets.” 
     
      
    11 The material I have set out above comprises the relevant parts of Exhibit “A”. It is to be accepted, however, that there were television reports referring to the matter appearing on SBS News, ABC television and, briefly, on Sky News. Some of the reportage purported to show people preparing the soft drink bombs by injecting the hydrogen peroxide and other materials into plastic soft drink bottles. There were also newspaper reports but they are not in evidence. I accept they may have covered similar territory.  
     
      
       
      Submissions on behalf of the Accused 
       
      
    12 Mr Button SC submitted that it was not just a matter of this event in London coming to the jury's attention at this late stage of the trial, although, counsel said, it was a striking incident involving, as it did, a plan to blow up a number of planes passing between London and North America. Rather, senior counsel relied on five “striking” similarities between the London trial and this present trial. Mr Button said that the similarities were of such a striking kind that they could almost lead the jury to regard the overseas event as some sort of tendency evidence connected to the allegations in the Sydney trial. The five “striking” similarities were said to be as follows: 
     
      
    13 First, the central role of hydrogen peroxide as the primary ingredient in the explosives in the London plot. Secondly, the use of a light bulb filament as a detonator. Thirdly, the reference to refilled batteries carrying the chemical detonator. Fourthly, the use of coded communications of the kind I have described above. Finally, there was the allegation that one of the offenders had attended Pakistan and brought back with him the plan to enable him to assemble a terror cell and identify targets.  
     
      
    14 In the light of these alleged ""striking similarities"", Mr Button SC made three specific points. These were:  
     
      
       
       First, the “striking similarities” were of such a kind that the jury could not help but infer that the allegations in the Sydney trial came from the same book or manual on how to engage in a terrorist act. It was not just a matter of another event being reported, counsel said, it was a matter of very specific and very prejudicial similarities. 
       
       
       Secondly, Mr Button SC argued that the present application had to be seen in the context of all that had preceded it in the eleven months or so since the jury was first empanelled. The most important of those matters was the Mumbai atrocity that had featured in media reports and the repeated reference in those reports to the involvement of LeT and Pakistani terrorists. Mr Button reminded the Court that two Australians had been killed in that massacre. Reference was also made to the Jakarta bombings which occurred during the currency of the trial; the reporting of the plea of guilty to a terrorism offence by one Shane Kent in Victoria, reports of the Melbourne raids upon a number of Somalian men in more recent times; an article in The Sun Herald referring to the convicted terrorist Lodhi and the man Willie Brigitte, including an assertion that Lodhi had ordered chemicals in a false name and the notoriety given by the press to the convictions of a number of Melbourne men, including the cleric Abdul Benbrika. Finally, reference was made to a “problem” that arose in the trial many months ago when a supporter of the accused had apparently acted in a somewhat intimidating manner towards some members of the jury as they made their way to their motor vehicles. The point Mr Button made was that the present publicity relating to the London trial might be seen as the culmination, as it were, of all that had happened in the past during the Sydney trial. It was, he said, the “last straw”. 
       
       
      Thirdly, senior counsel made special mention of the fact that the Court should not confine its considerations to the printed form of the media, but should recognise the fact that many people today receive their daily consumption of news from material published on the Internet. 
       
      
    15 Mr Button accepted, of course, that the appropriate legal principles place a high hurdle in relation to the present application and that the Court would be entitled to take into account the timing of the present application as a factor strongly against the discharge of the jury.  
     
      
       
      Submissions of the Crown 
       
      
    16 Mr Maidment SC pointed to the fact that the present jury had been instructed on a number of occasions to confine their attention to the evidence in the trial. They had been specifically directed not to pay attention to any media reporting of the trial. In particular, the jury have been instructed on a number of occasions to put out of their mind altogether any reference to terrorist activities occurring either in this country or overseas and to focus only on the evidence in the trial. Senior counsel said that it would require a very cynical view of an Australian jury to think that they would not be capable of following the directions that had been given clearly and repeatedly throughout the trial. Moreover, Mr Maidment said it was an extraordinary proposition that a jury would be likely to be influenced in any way by events taking place on the other side of the world, even allowing for the similarities that the defence had drawn to the Court's attention. 
     
      
    17 The Crown also argued that a proper evaluation of the situation should lead to a clear conclusion that the jury, in all the circumstances, and indeed taking into account all that had gone before in terms of the contextual matters relied upon by Mr Button, would be capable of putting this most recent matter to one side in the same way as they had been able to put all the earlier matters to one side. The jury would be able to do this not only individually, but collectively. The jury would be able to treat the present trial on its merits, that is by having regard only to the evidence that is properly admissible in the trial. Finally, Mr Maidment SC argued that the present application did not come even close to the level of necessity that being the appropriate test to be applied in the circumstances. 
     
      
       
      Principles to be applied on the application 
       
      
    18 There is no dispute between the parties as to the principles applicable in the present situation. It is fundamental to our system of criminal justice that a person should not be convicted of an offence save after a fair hearing according to law (Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 293, 362 per Gaudron J). Although the Court should be slow to stay proceedings or to discharge a jury, in an appropriate case, the Court should not refrain from taking either step (R v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592, 623 per Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ; see also the Victorian Court of Appeal judgment upholding the trial judge's order restraining publication of the television series ""Underbelly"": General Television Corporation Pty Limited v DPP [2008] VSCA 103.  
     
      
    19 It is not necessary for the accused, in a discharge application, to demonstrate that he or she would not have a fair trial. It is sufficient if there is a real risk of prejudice if the trial were to continue (Re K (2002) NSWCCA 374 at (9)(10) per Beazley JA, Sully and Simpson JJ). In that case the Court found there had been “an unacceptable risk” (para 18) and that there would be a ""real risk"" if the trial were to proceed immediately following the pronouncement of the Court's decision. 
     
      
    20 Courts will assume that the jury, properly instructed, will accept and obey the directions of the trial judge to decide the case solely on the evidence placed before it during the trial. As Johnson J noted in R v Petroulias [No 19] BC200711115 at (40) - a judgment involving a stay application:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There is an increasing body of judicial opinion to the effect that whatever pre-trial publicity exists, jurors, when they take on the solemn responsibility of the performance of their duties in the courtroom, differentiate between gossip, rumour, news and opinion which they hear before the case and the evidence which they hear in the Court in the trial for which they are empanelled. A question remains in each case where the intensity, proximity and nature of the media coverage of the particular accused, or the particular circumstances, is such as to occasion the risk of unfairness to the accused so as to prejudice the accused's right to a fair trial for a time after the publicity. A judgment is called upon in each case having regard to the particular facts which are proved:  
        R v Yuill 
         (1993) 69 A Crim R 450 at 453-454."" 
        
       
      
    21 I would venture to suggest that similar considerations arise in an application such as the present, where the publicity is directed not to the accused, but where it relates to persons who have no connection whatsoever to the accused.  
     
      
    22 In R v Glennon, Mason CJ and Toohey J at 603 observed that the possibilities that a juror might acquire irrelevant or prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial, and continued:-  
     
      
       
        
        “The law acknowledges the existence of that possibility but proceeds on the footing that the jury, acting in conformity with the instructions given to them by the trial judge, will render a true verdict in accordance with the evidence. As Toohey J observed in  
        Hinch 
         (1987) 164 CLR at 74, in the past too little weight may have been given to the capacity of jurors to assess critically what they see and hear and their ability to reach their decisions by reference to the evidence before them.” 
        
       
      
    23 In John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v District Court of New South Wales (2004) 61 NSWLR 344, Spigelman CJ (Handley JA and M Campbell AJA agreeing) said at 366 (102-103):-  
     
      
       
        
        “As set out above his Honour expressed his concern that a future trial judge could not effectively ensure a fair trial by giving the jury directions, particularly as this may highlight the issues which establish the possibility of prejudice. In this regard, in my opinion, his Honour was proceeding on a basis which has, in recent years, come to be rejected by the Courts in relevantly analogous case law. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        There are now a significant number of cases in which the issue has arisen as to whether or not an accused was able to have a fair trial in the light of substantial media publicity, indeed publicity much more sensational and sustained than anything that occurred here. Those cases have decisively rejected the previous tendency to regard jurors as exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice. Trial judges of considerable experience have asserted, again and again, that jurors approach their task in accordance with the oath they take, that they listen to the directions they are given and implement them. In particular, that they listen to the direction that they are to determine guilt only on the evidence before them.” 
        
       
      
    24 The ""test of necessity"", accepted by the parties in the present matter as being applicable to the resolution of this application, was stated recently by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Crowther-Wilkinson (2004) NSWCCA 249. In that case two interlocutory judgments by the trial judge (Hidden J) had been published on the Court's website during the trial. The first was an application for a separate trial, and the second concerned the admissibility of a statement made to police. The Court determined that there had been no miscarriage of justice and that there was no warrant for the discharge of the jury. Included in the Court's reasoning was the fact that there was no evidence to suggest that any member of the jury had actually accessed the Internet to scrutinise the two judgments. Secondly, the jury had been given an instruction to consider the evidence impartially and rationally, and directed to make a decision based only on the evidence. Thirdly, the case against the appellant was absolutely compelling, such that his conviction would have been inevitable. 
     
      
    25 In the course of giving the leading judgment, Wood CJ at CL (with whom Dowd and Kirby JJ agreed) said at paras 203 to 208:- 
     
      
       
        
        “203 There have obviously been cases where it has been considered necessary to halt a trial mid stream, where that kind of publicity has been particularly prejudicial. The principle which has been established in relation to this kind of event and other prejudicial happenings, is one of necessity; that is, there has to be a “high degree of need”, in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice, before a discharge will be ordered:  
        Crofts v The Queen 
         (1986) 186 CLR 427 at 432. 
        
       
       
        
        204 In most instances, it has been accepted that sufficient directions can be given to overcome the problem, since it has been recognized that jurors can be trusted to obey the directions that they are given:  
        R v Bell  
        NSWCCA 
          
        8 October 1998,  
        Glennon v The Queen 
         (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 603,  
        Hinch v Attorney General 
          
        (Vic) (No. 2)  
        (1998) 164 CLR 15 at 74,  
        Murphy v The Queen 
         (1989) 167 CLR 94 at 99,  
        R v Yuill 
         (1993) 69 A Crim R 450 at 453/4, and  
        R v Loguancio 
         (2000) 1 VR 235 at para 24. 
        
       
       
        
        205 This is an important assumption, which underpins the retention of jury trials (see  
        R v Gilbert  
        (2000) 201 CLR 414 per McHugh J at para 31). I do not believe that it has been fatally flawed by the experience in the two recent cases decided in this State to which I will later refer ( 
        R v K 
         [2003] NSWCCA 401 and  
        R v Skaf 
         [2004] NSWCCA 37). 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        206 The authorities concerning prejudicial publicity tend to suggest moreover that the  
        mere possibility 
         of a juror having acquired prejudicial or extraneous knowledge, during a trial, is not normally a sufficient basis for concluding that the accused did not have a fair trial or that there was a miscarriage of justice. 
        
       
       
        
        207 For example, in  
        Glennon 
        , Mason CJ and Toohey J said at 603: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ’Likewise, the suggestion that there was a substantial risk that at least one juror would have acquired knowledge, before the verdict was given, of the respondent's prior conviction was again a matter of mere conjecture or speculation. The mere possibility that such knowledge may have been acquired by a juror during the trial is not a sufficient basis for concluding that the accused did not have a fair trial or that there was a miscarriage of justice. Something more must be shown. The possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant and prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
       
        
        208 In  
        Murphy v The Queen 
         (1989) 167 CLR 94, Mason CJ and Toohey J said at 99: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘…it is misleading to think that, because a juror has heard something of the circumstances giving rise to the trial, the accused has lost the opportunity of an indifferent jury. The matter was put this way by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R v Hubbert (1975) 29 CCC (2d) 279 at 291: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'In this era of rapid dissemination of news by the various media, it would be naive to think that in the case of a crime involving considerable notoriety, it would be possible to select 12 jurors who had not heard anything about the case. Prior information about a case, and even the holding of a tentative opinion about it, does not make partial a juror sworn to render a true verdict according to the evidence.'” 
          
         
        
       
       
      
    26 Crowther-Wilkinson, and a number of the authorities referred to in it, essentially deal with the situation where there has been prejudicial publicity concerning the matters directly involved in the particular trial. Often this will take the form of sensational media reporting of the allegations against a particular person in relation to a serious crime at a time prior to the commencement of the trial. It may take the form of inaccurate reporting during the currency of the trial. In either case, the situation is rather different from the present one where the reporting deals with a topic similar to that involved in a current trial, but is not suggested to be publicity about the accused themselves or their involvement in the crime with which they are charged. In any event, as I have said, the parties are in complete agreement as to the principles applicable to the resolution of the matter. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
      
    27 The first point is to decide whether it is likely that any members of the jury would have seen the particular news reports either on television or in the newspapers. Would any member of the jury have heard reports about the London convictions on the radio? Would they have encountered the publicity on the net, or in any other electronic form? The answer to that question is really quite uncertain. There is no evidence on the point. It is impossible to be certain that they would not have seen something of the news in one form or another, but there is simply no evidence from which one could conclude that it was seen, scrutinised in detail, examined or likely to have been, in any sense, embedded in the consciousness of any individual juror. Barely a month has gone past in this trial when there has not been some terrorist outrage in a country or countries overseas. Indeed, as Mr Button pointed out, there have been at least two instances where terror-related arrests or convictions have been publicised concerning to events in Australia.  
     
      
    28 There is no particular reason, in my view, to accept that the media information I have summarised would have been scrutinised in the way it has been by the lawyers for the accused. Their attention to the detail of the articles has been very similar to the type of approach taken by defamation lawyers to media publications. The simple truth of the matter is that our media information is replete, on a daily basis, with outrages of many criminal kinds. This extends, as I have said, on a fairly regular basis, to terrorist related activities or reports. It is a sad reality of contemporary existence. 
     
      
    29 But if I be wrong about this preliminary aspect of the argument, I do not, in any event, think that the ""striking similarities"" argument has the force suggested by Mr Button SC in his careful arguments. I will endeavour to explain why this is so.  
     
      
    30 The first proposition is that although there are obvious similarities, there are major differences between the London plot and the allegations made in the present case. In the London situation, a group of Pakistani men, it appears, had determined upon a precise plot to bring down a number of transatlantic flights. The plan was so advanced that a test run had been undertaken, it seems, on a domestic flight. Further, the precise method of detonation of the explosives on the planes had been selected and thoroughly tested at ground level. By contrast, in the present trial, there is no suggestion that any of the accused had ever identified a target or targets. There is no mention of aeroplanes or of explosives in connection with any target whatsoever. There is no suggestion in the present trial that it had been determined who would carry out any proposed terrorist act or acts. The Crown case falls well short of suggesting that the accused, or any of them, were to be the bombers themselves. Certainly, the Crown case stops short of suggesting that any decision had been made that any of the accused would be the bombers and, as I have said, no target or targets had been selected. There was not the slightest suggestion in the present case, as I have said, that the ultimate aim of the collection of any chemicals or ammunition was the destruction and death of passengers on aeroplanes. 
     
      
    31 Another major difference is that, in the London trial, there was a video of one of the accused making plain his intentions that he was going to be involved in the death of innocent civilians. It was made plain that he would undertake this devastation because of the failure by America and its allies to heed Osama bin Laden's warning to leave Muslim lands. 
     
      
    32 Again, by way of contrast, in the present trial, there is no evidence, by way of TI or LD, to suggest that any of the accused themselves has been captured making what was called in the media reports ""a suicide video"". There is no discussion, as the defence have pointed out to the jury, which mentions a plan or proposal to bomb any target in Australia or overseas. There is indeed no direct reference to the offence alleged in the indictment. 
     
      
    33 The third and most important difference is that each of the accused has put a case to the jury in the present trial stressing that he was not a participant in any enterprise to undertake or do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. The defence case of each man is that, even if there were some type of criminal enterprise of the kind alleged by the Crown in the indictment, he, certainly, was not a party to such an enterprise. For example, the accused Hasan gave evidence before the jury that his ordering and/or collection of chemicals was undertaken innocently, at the behest of another man who he believed was endeavouring to raise money to send funds overseas to Muslim charities. Hasan's evidence was that his involvement in the ordering of laboratory equipment was to help another friend establish or enlarge an organic products business. None of the other accused gave evidence. But the case of Elomar, Jamal and Khaled Cheikho fastened, to one degree or another, upon the evidence given by Hasan. Moustafa Cheikho's case was simply that he had no involvement in any such criminal conspiracy. Each accused argued that the Crown had simply failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he was a participant in the alleged criminal conspiracy. The defence case was placed strongly and unequivocally before the jury in the closing submissions of all counsel. 
     
      
    34 As to the particular ""striking similarities"" the following may be observed:  
     
      
    35 First, it is true that there is an allegation in the present trial that hydrogen peroxide was acquired for the purposes of the alleged conspiracy. Of the accused, it is only Moustafa Cheikho who is alleged to have purchased hydrogen peroxide at a suburban Sydney pharmacy. This allegation is flatly denied and there is a very live issue as to the reliability of the young lady who purported to identify him as the purchaser. The hydrogen peroxide purchased on that occasion was found behind the premises of Khaled Sharrouf. He is one of the alleged conspirators, but he is not on trial in the present proceedings. He is not one of the accused. It is not suggested he was the purchaser. It is not suggested any of the other four accused was the purchaser. The Crown case has not sought to rely upon the co-conspirators' rule. Rather, the Crown case relies only on the conduct and words of each individual accused as being the evidence of participation in the alleged conspiracy. It is also true that Moustafa Cheikho had four bottles of hydrogen peroxide at his home when he was arrested. An innocent explanation, however, was given for this before the jury.  
     
      
    36 The second aspect of similarity was said to be the use of a light bulb filament as a detonator. True it is, once again, that there is an allegation that Moustafa Cheikho possessed a tool kit with cut off fairy lights in it. There was also information on his computer that might be said to show an interest in detonators using an ohmmeter, et cetera. Khaled Cheikho was also said to possess material that showed an interest in basic electronics but it was, overall, rather muted evidence.  
     
      
    37 The third matter was said to be a reference to ""battery refills"". Again, it is true that the Crown allegation is that battery acid was being purchased for the purposes of the conspiracy. In the London trial, however, although the information is sparse, it would seem that miniature batteries were likely to have been the repository for a chemical detonator. As I say, in the Sydney trial, the Crown alleges that the battery acid was being used with a view to it being used in the making of an explosive. But neither the nature of the ultimate bomb, nor its final composition, was said to have been selected. 
     
      
    38 The fourth matter was the coded messages. The Crown does rely on coded messages in the present case, but suggests that they related simply to the organisation of covert meetings so that materials in connection with the conspiracy could be concealed or hidden from the authorities. There is a significant difference in this from the London situation. In the London plot, the coded messages were specifically to do with the bombing of transatlantic planes. The fact that the opening words of the messages contained false expressions of endearment would not, in my view, reveal a “striking similarity” between the London situation and that alleged in the Sydney trial. 
     
      
    39 The final matter was the allegation in London that one of the offenders had attended Pakistan and brought back with him a plan to assemble a terrorist cell, gather material and to identify targets. There is evidence in the Sydney trial that Moustafa Cheikho attended an LeT training camp in Pakistan in 2001. He denies this and there is a very live issue as to the reliability of the identifying party, and indeed, his truthfulness. The evidence is, however, strictly confined to the case against Moustafa Cheikho. The jury have been told that they cannot use that evidence, even if they accept it, in any way against any of the other men. The consequence of this is that there is no suggestion in the trial that Moustafa Cheikho “brought back” with him any plan to undertake terrorist activities in Australia, let alone a suggestion that such a plan was part of, or central to the alleged conspiratorial task. Moreover, the jury have been told that they cannot use the evidence of Moustafa Cheikho's training in Pakistan, if they find he it was he, as a evidence of any tendency on his part to commit the crime in the indictment. The jury has been told that it is no more than a piece of circumstantial evidence to be assembled, along with other matters relating to Moustafa Cheikho, in their determination as to whether the Crown has proved its case against him beyond reasonable doubt. I suggest that there are very marked dissimilarities between this situation and that referred to in the reporting of the London plot. 
     
      
    40 I have thus far evaluated, as it were, the force of the ""striking similarities"" argument. I accept it has some substance in it. But it does not carry the weight and texture attributed to it by Mr Button. My view is that, even if the jury had read, seen or heard any of the media reports on the London plot, they might have noticed some similarities, but they would have been able to appreciate immediately the significant range of differences. 
     
      
    41 This leads me to the final point. In my view, the Crown's principal submission is entirely correct. This jury has been instructed on a number of occasions, where it has been necessary to do so, that they are to pay no attention to any media reports of incidents occurring either in Australia or overseas that have a terrorist connection or connotation. They have been told, tactfully but forcefully, that the trial is to be determined only on the evidence that is heard and seen in the courtroom. In my view, this jury has been responsive at all times to these directions. They are, I suggest, well drilled and well regimented into understanding and acting in a way that enables them to put out of their mind matters that are extraneous to the evidence in the trial. I have not the slightest doubt that they will do so in relation to the reporting relating to the transatlantic jet bomb plot. The jury will heed the directions that have been given and will decide this case on the evidence that is before them. 
     
      
    42 The final matter I should mention is that the trial has been going, as I have indicated, for nearly eleven months. This is not to say that, in an appropriate situation, the Court would hesitate from discharging a jury. Obviously the Court would be reluctant to do so after so many months of trial. But if there were a real risk of a miscarriage of justice, the Court would be obliged to accede to a discharge application, notwithstanding that the trial had been going for a very long time. 
     
      
    43 It will be clear from the reasons I have given, however, that I do not think there is any prospect that a miscarriage of justice has occurred or will occur here. I am perfectly satisfied that this jury will honour its oath and decide the case in accordance with the evidence. It will be able to put out of its mind, individually and collectively, as it has done in relation to any other incidents that have occurred during the trial, the recent spate of media publicity. There is no need, indeed no necessity, to discharge the jury in the present circumstances.

        Judgment 
       
      
     
     
     
      
    1 YOUNG JA : I agree with Latham J 
     
      
    2 JOHNSON J : I agree with Latham J. 
     
      
    3 LATHAM J : The applicants each seek leave to appeal against sentences imposed by Goldring DCJ (the Judge) on 13 August 2008 in respect of a number of offences committed on 2 December 2006. Each applicant was sentenced for steal from the person and robbery in company, carrying maximum penalties of 14 years and 20 years respectively. The applicant Walton was also sentenced for affray, carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 The sentences were imposed following the applicants’ conviction on 2 June 2008 after a trial lasting several days. On the second day of their joint trial, the applicant Walton pleaded guilty to the affray offence. 
     
      
    5 The applicants received the same sentence for the offence of steal from the person, namely a non parole period of one year and 6 months, with a balance of term of one year. Walton received a sentence of 6 years for the robbery in company offence, comprising a non parole period of 3 years. Scorah received a sentence of 5 years for the robbery in company offence, comprising a non parole period of 3 years. The applicant Walton received a sentence of 8 months for the affray. 
     
      
    6 A degree of accumulation resulted in an aggregate sentence of 7 years and 5 months, with an aggregate non parole period of 4 years and 5 months in respect of the applicant Walton. Scorah’s aggregate non parole period is one of 4 years, with a balance of term of 2 years. 
     
      
    7 The applicants contend that the sentences individually and collectively are manifestly excessive and that the principles of parity are engaged when one has regard to the sentence imposed upon Walton’s brother, AW, in the Childrens Court. He received concurrent 2 years good behaviour bonds for the same offences of steal from the person and robbery in company.  
     
      
       
      The Offences 
       
      
    8 The following description of the offences is taken from the Judge’s remarks on sentence. No issue was taken with this summary for the purposes of the appeal. 
     
      
       
        
        On 2 December 2006 at about 5 p.m. four young men left the Bellambi hotel, walked east along Bellambi lane and up the ramp to the Bellambi railway station. They had all been drinking in the hotel and were carrying bottles, including a bottle of whisky. From the point they entered the ramp their actions on the station were caught on closed-circuit television. The four were the two offenders, AW, and a fourth man who appears to be called Shane Woodside. ……………….. 
         
        As they walked up the ramp to the station the four men appear to have a discussion, then they walked in single file along the eastern side of the platform until they reached the entrance to a shelter where the ticket office and ticket machine is situated. MS, then 15 years old, had bought a ticket and was waiting in the shelter. He had seen the four men approaching and was a little apprehensive. He was counting money and had a $20 note in his hand. The four young men walked towards him and one of them took the money from his hand. They then went onto the western side of the platform. MS followed and asked for his money back, but the four men mocked him. MS then left the station and walked east to Pioneer road from where he called the police on a mobile phone. These events constituted the offence of steal from the person. 
         
        The four young men then walked south along the platform. At the southern end of the platform a young woman was sitting on an upturned milk crate. The offender Walton kicked the milk crate from under the woman. She stood and walked north along the platform. The offender followed her. He reached the milk crate, picked it up and threw it at her. She avoided it and continued to walk north along the platform. The offender then picked up the milk crate and threw it at her again. These events which were also captured on closed-circuit television constitute the offence of affray to which Mr Walton pleaded guilty at the trial. 
         
        The four men then caught a train to Corrimal. Again, some, but not all of their activities were recorded on closed-circuit television. As they walked down the platform towards the exit, AW appeared to kick at the train and lost his footing. A young man with a bicycle, ZG, was following them but when AW fell over, ZG walked around him. The four young men then walked past ZG and left the station. ZG mounted his bicycle and rode it off the platform. On his evidence, and this was not shown on closed-circuit television, he was being jostled by the four young men and placed in a headlock by Carl Walton, who then beckoned to AW. The other man stood in the middle of the road outside the station blocking ZG’s route. ZG became apprehensive, put down his bicycle and took off his bag which he placed on the ground. AW came up to him and knocked him to the ground two or three times. Carl Walton picked up the bicycle and rode off on it. The other offenders, including Kevin Scorah, picked up his bag and removed his watch and other items from it. They also took an Ipod from a pouch on ZG’s belt. 
         
        The four men then walked east down Murray Rd. Some of their movements can be seen on the closed-circuit television recording, but the actual assault is obscured. However ZG gave evidence, as did two eyewitnesses. ZG got to his feet and ran after the four men, or three men actually, because Carl Walton had ridden off on the bicycle. They stopped ZG and there was a further fight. ……… I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that either of the offenders before me took part in that assault. ZG says he was knocked to the ground but cannot say who caused this. As a result ZG suffered lacerations to his face and knee and a chipped tooth. There is no doubt in my mind that there was a robbery immediately ZG left the station and what happened after that is not necessary to find that offence established. 
         
        The offenders ran south and through the East Corrimal public school to an area near Towradgi Creek. Scorah and AW were apprehended in this area. Carl Walton was arrested two days later after a search warrant was executed at his parent’s home, and clothing matching that shown on the closed-circuit television recording was found there. These events constituted the offence of robbery in company. 
        
       
      
    9 During the hearing of the appeal, the Court watched the closed circuit television footage. The narrative of the events constituting the offences took on an added dimension. The behaviour towards the young woman minding her own business on the railway platform, as depicted in the film, was calculated to intimidate and harass. The milk crate was apparently thrown with considerable force and narrowly missed its target. Having seen the footage, as did the jury in the applicants’ trial, I would agree with the Judge’s assessment of the objective gravity of the offences in these terms :- 
     
      
       
        
         What makes these offences rather more serious than would otherwise have been the case, is that they were committed in or near railway stations on a summer Saturday afternoon. The public has a right to expect to be able to travel by train without being assaulted and robbed and otherwise put in fear by drunken hooligans. The property involved in this case was not particularly valuable, however three totally different innocent individuals were threatened by behaviour, put in fear and, in the case of Mr Gordon, suffered quite serious physical injuries. There can be little doubt in my view that each victim who gave evidence suffered psychological injury. The robbery offence was vicious and unprovoked. It is aggravated because it involved the use of gratuitous force, which could have endangered the life of the victim. [ZG] himself did not say he was kicked in the head, but an eyewitness said he was, and that is not necessary for a finding of the use of actual or threatened force, that is, the violence which is an essential element of robbery. ……. There is evidence of gratuitous use of force and reckless [dis]regard for human safety, and that is a seriously aggravating factor. 
        
       
      
    10 It has been submitted that there is some inconsistency between the absence of a finding that the applicants inflicted violence after the robbery offence and the remarks immediately above. However, the context of the latter remarks is clearly the description of the robbery as a joint criminal enterprise. The Judge was entitled to take the infliction of violence into account as a circumstance surrounding the commission of the offence, regardless of the individual role played by each applicant. 
     
      
     The Applicant Walton 
     
      
    11 The applicant Walton was 21 years of age at the time of the offences. He has a number of previous convictions for property offences, affray and offences against public order. His criminal history begins in July 2002, when the applicant received the benefit of three suspended control orders with conditions, including that he be of good behaviour. Those bonds were breached by the commission of further offences in November 2002. The applicant was given a number of control orders, resulting in an aggregate sentence of 15 months with a non parole period of 12 months. In December 2002, the applicant successfully appealed those sentences, allowing for his release in January 2003. Further offences were committed in July 2003 and April 2005. The applicant again received the benefit of suspended sentences. After the commission of the offences the subject of this appeal, the applicant continued to offend.  
     
      
    12 The applicant is the middle child of three children living with his parents. He was expelled from school after completing year 9 and completed one year of a TAFE apprenticeship. He had been working on a casual basis as a labourer since 2004. That position became full time in December 2007. The applicant has a young child from a relationship that ended in mid 2006, when the mother left the child in the care of the applicant and his parents. The child has since been returned to his mother. The applicant’s offending is associated with abuse of alcohol.  
     
      
    13 The applicant was interviewed by a Probation and Parole officer. In that interview, the applicant minimised the offences by claiming that the events surrounding the robbery did not qualify as such and that the young woman on the railway platform was a drug addict and he was demonstrating his disapproval. The closed circuit footage does not support such a contention. Bearing in mind that this interview was for the purposes of sentence, the Judge’s finding that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation was a generous one.  
     
      
       
      Parity Between Walton and AW 
       
      
    14 The applicant’s brother, AW, pleaded guilty in the Children’s Court to two counts of robbery in company. He was placed on two concurrent one year good behaviour bonds under s 33(1)(b) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. AW was 17 years of age at the time of the commission of these offences. He had no prior criminal history. 
     
      
    15 The Judge found that AW was the most violent of the group and that he had taken a leading role. The Judge went on to note that the applicant was also “deeply involved in the offence, being the person who actually took the money from MS … and the person who put ZG in a headlock.” The Judge was of the view that the sentences imposed upon AW were manifestly inadequate. His Honour went on to observe that the constraints inherent in the application of parity principles to juvenile and adult co-offenders were particularly relevant to the matter before him. For these reasons, his Honour disregarded the sentences imposed upon AW. 
     
      
    16 The applicant does not contend that strict parity applies, but relies upon Ersman v R [2007] NSWCCA 161 and R v Tran [2004] NSWCCA 6 in support of the submission that some consideration should have been given to the sentences imposed upon AW, leading to a “modest reduction” in the corresponding sentences imposed upon the applicant.  
     
      
    17 It must be acknowledged that the sentences imposed upon AW, who was on the threshold of adulthood, were inadequate, if not manifestly so. It was within the Judge’s sentencing discretion to decline to reduce the sentences he was minded to impose upon the applicant, even if he had taken account of the sentences imposed upon AW, as the principles summarised in R v Boney [2001] NSWCCA 432 make clear. The applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge’s failure to have regard to the sentences imposed upon AW amounts to an error that would have necessarily affected the outcome to his detriment. 
     
      
       
      Whether the Sentences Imposed upon Walton are Manifestly Excessive. 
       
      
    18 The applicant’s submissions acknowledge that the sentence of 2 years and 6 months for the offence of steal from the person is not an uncommon sentence, according to the JIRS statistics. The real complaint is that the objective circumstances of this offence were relatively trivial and that, disregarding the applicant’s subjective circumstances, a lesser sentence was warranted.  
     
      
    19 The applicant does not point to any material error on the part of the Judge capable of triggering a re-sentencing exercise by this Court. The submission really amounts to a contention that a different court might well have reached a different result. That is not a proper basis for setting aside a sentence that has been regularly imposed in the exercise of a broad sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    20 In respect of the sentence imposed for the offence of affray, the applicant relies upon the fact that summary disposition was the most likely outcome, had this offence not been caught up with related, more serious offences. It is then said that the sentencing pattern in the Local Court for this offence is of relevance and that, according to that pattern, a sentence of 8 months imprisonment is manifestly excessive. This submission is maintained, notwithstanding that the sentence for affray was made wholly concurrent with the sentences imposed for the other offences. 
     
      
    21 The applicant relies upon R v Palmer [2005] NSWCCA 349. The principles collected therein by Hall J, with whom Grove J and Smart AJ agreed, include a reference to the fact that the significance of the loss of the chance of a matter being dealt with in the Local Court varies from case to case. It is also of relevance that in Palmer, all the offences ultimately dealt with in the District Court were capable of summary disposition. That is not the position here. The affray was never likely to be subject to summary disposition, given that the offence of robbery in company was indictable.  
     
      
    22 The more apposite observations in the circumstances of this case are those in R v Cage [2006] NSWCCA 304, wherein I said (Hunt AJA and Johnson J agreeing) :- 
     
      
       
        
        28 In  
        R v Gent 
         [2005] NSWCCA 370, Johnson J. reviewed the principles relevant to the sentencing of an offender in the District Court where summary disposition of the charges was available. Following references to  
        R v Crombie 
         [1999] NSWCCA 297 at paragraphs 15 to 16 and  
        R v El Masri 
         [2005] NSWCCA 167 at paragraph 29, Johnson J. concluded (at par 84) that ""the principles in  
        Crombie 
         and  
        El Masri 
         have particular application with respect to .... offences in relation to which the accused person is committed for trial but where the person is acquitted of, or the Crown does not proceed with, the more serious charge."" In those circumstances, ""the offender may be in a position to contend, with some force, that he or she stands for sentence in the District Court with respect to an offence which otherwise would have been disposed of summarily in the Local Court.""  
        
       
      
     
     
      
    23 The only submission made to the Judge by this applicant’s legal representative was that there should be no additional penalty for the affray offence, given that it was part of a course of criminal conduct of much greater gravity. That submission was accepted and was reflected in the result. Once the applicant was convicted of the affray, he stood to be sentenced on the basis that the offence carries a 10 year maximum penalty. A sentence of 8 months imprisonment was entirely appropriate to the objective and subjective circumstances of this offence. The applicant’s complaint in this Court has no substance. 
     
      
    24 The applicant’s submissions in respect of the sentence for the offence of robbery in company assert that the Judge “appears to have simply oscillated around the Henry guideline figure.” The Crown submits that there is nothing in the remarks or the transcript of the sentencing submissions that could support such a conclusion. It is also submitted that the Judge erred in noting that “the Henry decision applied to cases where there was an early plea of guilty.” (See R v Henry & Ors. [1999] NSWCCA 111 ; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 ; (1999) 106 A Crim R 149) The Crown acknowledges that this is an error, but maintains that no lesser sentence is warranted.  
     
      
    25 Taking the latter error first, it is not difficult to discern how that comment may have affected the Judge’s determination of the sentence for this offence. If the Judge was wrongly of the view that the Henry guideline posited a sentence of 4 to 5 years in circumstances where an offender is now nominally entitled to a discount of 25%, then his Honour may well have notionally increased the sentence to allow for the conviction after trial. However, an exchange between the Judge and the applicant’s legal representative during sentencing submissions on 7 August 2008, during which the Henry guideline was discussed in terms of its application to a plea of guilty simpliciter, suggests that the Judge had already formed the impression that the offence was “more serious than the Henry situation .. ,but not much more so.”  
     
      
    26 The extent of the Judge’s remarks on this topic were :- 
     
      
       
        
        The offence of stealing from the person is part of a group of offences dealt with in the same part of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . It is, even when committed in aggravated circumstances, less serious than the offence of robbery, because actual or threatened violence is not an element. The offence of robbery in company, however, is very serious and falls within the scope of the guideline established by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the case of  
        Henry 
        . It must be remembered that the  
        Henry 
         decision applied to cases in which there was an early plea of guilty. In that case the court pointed to a number of factors which courts should consider, and in this case the victims were in each case a single person facing a group of four young men. In the case of the robbery of ZG there was gratuitous violence and actual injury, and that in itself takes it slightly outside the range of sentences which the court discussed in  
        Henry 
        .  
        
       
      
    27 The last sentence in this passage supports the conclusion that his Honour’s reference to “an early plea of guilty” did not significantly affect the sentencing outcome. The fact remains that the applicant went to trial. It was open to his Honour to impose a sentence above the generally appropriate sentence (4 to 5 years) that was applicable to an offence, absent the infliction of violence, to which there had been a plea of guilty. In taking account of these factors, the Judge was not “oscillating” around the Henry guideline. 
     
      
    28 It remains to consider whether the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive.  
     
      
       
      Whether the Aggregate Sentence Imposed on Walton is Manifestly Excessive 
       
      
    29 The applicant’s submissions on this ground rely primarily upon the commission of the offences as part of a “single episode of criminality … separated only by the short train ride from Bellambi to Corrimal.” It is said that where such offences share certain factors, “it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both” : R v Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1 at [27]. The elements common to the offences were not articulated, but I assume the applicant is referring to the fact that two of the offences involved the theft of property whilst the applicant was in the company of the same persons.  
     
      
    30 The context of the remark quoted above is :- 
     
      
       
        
        In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both. 
        
       
      
    31 For my part, I cannot see how the sentence imposed for any of the three offences adequately comprehends and reflects the criminality inherent in any other of those offences, given that each offence was committed against a separate victim. They were “discrete and independent criminal acts” in that sense. The totality of the applicant’s criminality could not be reflected without partial accumulation : see Regina v Dunn [2004] NSWCCA 41 at [50] ; R v KM [2004] NSWCCA 65 ; R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219, where it was noted that the closeness in time and proximity of two offences will often not be determinative factors and that, having regard to the purposes of sentencing set out in s.3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, ""... to fail to accumulate, at least partially, may well be seen as a failure to acknowledge the harm done to those individual victims ..."" per Simpson J at [38], referred to with approval in R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115.32 The real question is whether a sentence of 7 years and 4 months is a manifestly excessive representation of the applicant’s overall criminality. I do not think that it is. These were discrete offences that put members of the community using public transport in fear for their safety. The applicant’s remorse was limited and his subjective case was not wholly favourable. I would reject this ground of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      The Applicant Scorah 
       
      
    33 This applicant was 25 years of age at the time of the commission of the offences. This applicant had a criminal history beginning in 2000 consisting primarily of property offences at a summary level. Apart from serving a four months prison term, the applicant received the benefit of bonds, fines and community service orders for these offences. On 14 March 2005 the applicant entered a bond to be of good behaviour for two years. The instant offences represent breaches of this bond. The applicant has a dependency on alcohol that has contributed to his offending. The pre-sentence report indicated that the applicant’s past response to supervision had been generally unsatisfactory.  
     
      
    34 Mr Scorah’s former partner gave birth to a daughter in July 2007. He reportedly has a good relationship with the child and her mother, both of whom reside in Sydney. Mr Scorah left school before completing Year 9 due to his disruptive behaviour in class and has been employed as a welder. He was unemployed at the time of the offences. He was not an associate of his co-offenders, but had come into their company on the day of the offences at the hotel where they were drinking. 
     
      
    35 Mr Scorah continued to deny responsibility for the offences after his conviction. The video footage depicted this applicant as part of the group, although the Judge found that there was no evidence that he inflicted any physical violence. The applicant took property from ZG and from that victim’s bag. 
     
      
       
      Parity, and Manifest Excess 
        
       
      
    36 This applicant’s submissions on these grounds were identical to those of the applicant Walton and should be rejected for the same reasons. Additionally, it is said on behalf of the applicant that there were clear and significant distinctions between the role of Mr Walton in the offences and that of the applicant, that should have resulted in a more marked difference in the penalties imposed.  
     
      
    37 The applicant refers to R v Goundar [2001] NSWCCA 198 ; 127 A Crim R 331, where Wood CJ at CL held that an aider and abettor is not necessarily less culpable than the principal in the first degree, and that the level of involvement of such an offender must be judged by the facts of the case at hand. Similar observations have been made in relation to offenders as parties to a joint criminal enterprise. In R v Mitchell & Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296 ; 177 A Crim R 94, Howie J (with whom Giles JA and Fullerton J agreed) commented that some differentiation in the sentence imposed, albeit not substantial, may be warranted where the criminality of one offender is lesser than that of a co-offender in a joint criminal enterprise. To like effect is the decision of R v Wright [2009] NSWCCA 3.  
     
      
    38 It may be accepted that Mr Walton’s criminality was greater than Mr Scorah’s, in that the former took the money from MS and held ZG in a headlock, before AW punched him. However, I do not regard the differentiation to be so great. The facts as related by the Judge during the remarks on sentence included references to ZG being jostled “by the four young men” before ZG was restrained by Carl Walton. After ZG was knocked to the ground by AW, this applicant, AW and a co-offender picked up the bag and rifled through it. It is often the case that participants to a joint criminal enterprise such as this assume different roles. The restraint and assault of the victim allows a co-offender to obtain access to the victim’s property. However one dissects the respective acts committed by each participant, it must not be overlooked that it is precisely because of the presentation of the combined force of a number of people, each of whom act in concert with the others, that the victim is subdued.  
     
      
    39 In any event, the Judge explicitly referred to those features of the offences that differentiated this applicant from Mr Walton. The applicant’s complaint is not that the differentiation was not recognised, but that it was insufficiently reflected in the sentences imposed. I do not agree. A sentence of 5 years for the robbery in company was wholly within the Judge’s sentencing discretion, particularly given its commission whilst on conditional liberty and absent the benefit that would have flowed from a plea of guilty.  
     
      
    40 There is no substance to these grounds. The orders I propose are :- 
     
      
       
      1. In the applications for leave to appeal by Carl Walton and Kevin Scorah, leave is granted in each case. 
      
     2. In each case the appeals are dismissed.

       Prosecutions (NSW) 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT ON COSTS 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 3 December 2008 I allowed appeals by the five plaintiffs against their convictions in the Local Court of affray and, in the case of one of them, assault occasioning actual bodily harm: Campbell & Ors v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2008] NSWSC 1284. The plaintiffs seek an order for costs. For that purpose an affidavit of their solicitor, Craig Longman, setting out particulars of the amount of costs sought, was read. It was agreed that I should determine first whether the plaintiffs are entitled to costs at all. 
     
      
    2 The application for costs is governed by s 70 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. The effect of that section is that where an appeal succeeds against a conviction in summary proceedings instituted by a public prosecutor, the appellant is not entitled to costs as a matter of course. It must be shown that there was unreasonable conduct or impropriety in the investigation of the matter or in the initiation or conduct of the proceedings, or that there are exceptional circumstances relating to the prosecutor’s conduct of the proceedings.  
     
      
    3 For present purposes, the plaintiffs rely upon s 70(1)(a), which provides:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        70 Limit on costs awarded against public prosecutor 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Costs are not to be awarded in favour of an appellant whose conviction is set aside unless the appeal court is satisfied: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner, …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    4 In JD v DPP [2000] NSWSC 1092, I had occasion to consider a provision in identical terms in s 41A(2A) of the Justices Act 1902 (since repealed). I found that a magistrate had fallen into error in approaching the provision on the basis that the fact “that an investigation does not come up to optimum expectations would not put it in the category of being unreasonable or improper unless it was grossly below optimum standards …” I noted that no such expression appeared in the provision, and that to apply such a test would be “to place an unwarranted loss upon its terms”: [30].  
     
      
    5 I expressed my conclusion in this way at [31]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Obviously, an investigation which fails to meet optimum standards is not necessarily unreasonable. Equally, however, it might fairly be classed as unreasonable even though it does not fall grossly below those standards. … The test is purely objective. To find that the conduct of the investigation of a particular case was unreasonable does not necessarily impugn the general competence, far less the integrity, of those responsible for it.” 
        
       
      
    6 This leads me to a comment I must make about the decision of Hall J in Halpin v Department of Gaming and Racing [2007] NSWSC 815. In that case his Honour considered s 70 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, and at [49] referred to my decision in JD as authority for the proposition that “the expression ‘unreasonable or improper manner’ embraces the notion of the conduct of investigations in a way or by a method or a mode of procedure that grossly falls below the relevant standards applicable to the relevant type or class of investigation”. That appears to have been drawn from my judgment at [24], where I quoted the passage in the magistrate’s reasons which I found to be in error. That, of course, is not what I held to be the case, as was recognised by Jagot J in Wollongong City Council v Ensile Pty Ltd (No. 9) [2008] NSWLEC 248 at [9] – [10]. The problem may have arisen because of the format of some computer generated printouts of judgments by which a quoted passage is not clearly distinguished from the main text. I was handed such a printout of my judgment at the hearing of this application. 
     
      
    7 JD was also concerned with other aspects of the section of the Justices Act dealing with costs against a prosecutor, to which it is not necessary to refer. It is sufficient to say that I was not called upon to decide whether the investigation in that case was unreasonable or improper because, having found that the magistrate had fallen into error in relation to the relevant provision, the relief sought was that the matter be remitted to the Local Court for redetermination.  
     
      
    8 In the present case I have the benefit of written submissions by Mr Longman, pursued in oral argument by Mr Levitt, solicitor, the principal of the firm where Mr Longman was employed. Reference was made to three cases in which investigations were held to have been unreasonable because of a failure to pursue relevant inquiries or to interview a material witness. One of them involved another provision of the Justices Act in the same terms as s 70: Eslarn Holdings Pty Ltd v Tumut Shire Council (No. 3) [1999] NSWLEC 163. The other two were concerned with s 70: Cliftleigh Haulage Pty Ltd v Byron Shire Council [2007] NSWCCA 13, and Wollongong City Council v Ensile Pty Ltd (supra).  
     
      
    9 The present case is not of that kind. The expressions “unreasonable” and “improper” in s 70(1)(a) are related but, as this case shows, they are distinct. What is challenged here is not the adequacy of the investigation, but the propriety of it. Mr Levitt’s argument was founded on the behaviour of the police which was the focus of my principal judgment.  
     
      
    10 He relied upon the elucidation of the nature of impropriety in The Queen v Byrnes and Hopwood (1995) 183 CLR 501. The case was concerned with a provision of the South Australian Companies Code directed to the improper use of his position by an officer or employee of a corporation to gain an advantage. In the joint judgment at 513, it was recognised that “improper” is an indefinite term. Obviously, it falls to be considered in the context in which it is used. Nevertheless, I am assisted by the following passage from the joint judgment at 514 – 5: 
     
      
       
        
        “Impropriety does not depend on an alleged offender’s consciousness of impropriety. Impropriety consists in a breach of the standards of conduct that would be expected of a person in the position of the alleged offender by reasonable persons with knowledge of the duties, powers and authority of the position and the circumstances of the case.” 
        
       
      
    11 Mr Levitt relied upon passages from my principal judgment concerning the failure of the investigating police to comply with cl 33 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Regulation. This was the central issue in the appeals by all of the plaintiffs except Vivian Campbell, who was not interviewed and whose appeal was allowed on a different basis.  
     
      
    12 At [15], I noted that the magistrate had found that there had not been notification to the ALS as required by cl 33(1) and that, even if there had, it would have been futile because the four plaintiffs had presented themselves to police outside normal business hours. I thought it reasonable to infer that if there had been such a notification during business hours, the attendance of an ALS representative at the police station within a reasonable time could have been arranged: [19]. On the evidence, there was no reason why the police could not have had the plaintiffs return to the police station the following day during business hours: [18]. The magistrate found that there was “a general procedure” to provide the required notification to the ALS by fax after hours, even though police were aware that there would almost certainly be no response because there was usually no ALS representative at the office at that time: also at [15].  
     
      
    13 I concluded that each of these four plaintiffs was “interviewed at a time when cl 33 had not been complied with and when, to the knowledge of the police, there could not have been effective compliance”. Thus, as the evidence stood, the police had deliberately failed to comply with an important provision for the protection of vulnerable persons in their custody: [20]. The recorded interviews which were conducted were a significant part of the evidence against the plaintiffs: [23]. 
     
      
    14 For the Director, I was assisted by the written submissions, developed orally, of Ms Adams of counsel. She drew my attention to the principal judgment at [14], in which I noted the unchallenged finding of the magistrate that, apart from cl 33, the police had sought to comply with the LEPRA requirements. There was evidence that the plaintiffs had been informed of their rights, both orally and in writing, by the custody managers dealing with them, and that each had been cautioned at the outset of his interview. Accordingly, his Honour found that it could not be said that the police “deliberately went out of their way to cut corners and to provide no assistance” to the plaintiffs concerning their rights or the responsibilities which the police owed to them. Against that background, Ms Adams argued, I should not find relevant impropriety.  
     
      
    15 However, the fact remains that an important aspect of the LEPRA requirements, enshrined in cl 33, was not met. I found that breach to be deliberate, and the measure of that impropriety stood to be assessed against the background of a practice by police in the relevant area which denied to Aboriginal people the protection the clause was intended to afford them. It was in these circumstances that the four plaintiffs participated in recorded interviews which, as I have said, constituted a significant part of the case against them.  
     
      
    16 I am satisfied that, for the purpose of s 70(1)(a), it has been established that the investigation was conducted in an improper manner. That being so, my discretion to award costs to the plaintiffs is enlivened and I see no reason why it should not be exercised in their favour. In so saying, I take into account the fact that the issue upon which the appeal succeeded was not given the attention it deserved at first instance: see the principal judgment at [17] – [18]. I should also remind the police officers involved that the award of costs does not reflect upon their general competence or their integrity. 
     
      
    17 Of course, none of this reasoning applies to Vivian Campbell, who was not interviewed, and no submission was made to me concerning costs in her case. This may be of no moment because the appeal was conducted on behalf of all five plaintiffs in one proceeding, in which all were represented by the same solicitor and counsel. For practical purposes, it may be that no purpose would be served by awarding costs to four of the plaintiffs but not to the fifth. This, however, is a matter which the parties may wish to consider and, in any event, it will be necessary to hear them on the formal order which should be made.

     JUDGMENT 
      
      
     [2009] NSWIRComm 158 
    1 These proceedings concern four prosecutions instituted by the prosecutor, Inspector Marie Gregory of the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales, against two named defendants. The corporate defendant, S&P Jackson Pty Ltd, carries on business trading as North Coast Cranes. The individual defendant, Scott Jackson, is the sole director and shareholder of the corporate defendant.  
    2 The corporate defendant operated a business in Coffs Harbour suppling cranes and persons to operate those cranes. On 17 June 2006, the corporate defendant had supplied a crane and operators to work on a site at Coffs Harbour. The crane was used to suspend a workbox in which was situated an employee of the corporate defendant and another person who was an employee of the organisation at whose site the work was being carried out. Whilst the crane was being operated, the workbox fell approximately 15 metres severely injuring the two occupants. 
    3 The corporate defendant was charged with breaches of ss 8(1) and 8(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (“the Act”). Scott Jackson was charged with the same breaches by virtue of s 26(1) of the Act because at the relevant time he was a director of the corporate defendant. 
    4 Relevantly, ss 8(1) and 8(2) and 26 of the Act are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       8 Duties of employers  
       
      
      
       
       (1) Employees An employer must ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all the employees of the employer.  
        
       That duty extends (without limitation) to the following:  
        
        
         
         (a) ensuring that any premises controlled by the employer where the employees work (and the means of access to or exit from the premises) are safe and without risks to health,  
          
          
         (b) ensuring that any plant or substance provided for use by the employees at work is safe and without risks to health when properly used, 
          
           
          
         (c) ensuring that systems of work and the working environment of the employees are safe and without risks to health, 
          
           
          
         (d) providing such information, instruction, training and supervision as may be necessary to ensure the employees’ health and safety at work,  
          
          
         (e) providing adequate facilities for the welfare of the employees at work.  
          
         
        
       (2) Others at workplace An employer must ensure that people (other than the employees of the employer) are not exposed to risks to their health or safety arising from the conduct of the employer’s undertaking while they are at the employer’s place of work. 
        
         
        
       See section 12 for the penalty for an offence against this section and other provisions of this Division. Division 4 makes ancillary provision with respect to those offences, including: 
        
        
         
         (a) section 26—liability of directors and managers of corporations,  
          
          
         (b) section 28—defence that compliance not reasonably practicable etc.  
          
         
        
       See also Division 2 for duty of employer to consult employees. 
       
      
      
       
       26 Offences by corporations—liability of directors and managers  
       
      
      
       
       (1) If a corporation contravenes, whether by act or omission, any provision of this Act or the regulations, each director of the corporation, and each person concerned in the management of the corporation, is taken to have contravened the same provision unless the director or person satisfies the court that:  
        
        
         
         (a) he or she was not in a position to influence the conduct of the corporation in relation to its contravention of the provision, or  
          
          
         (b) he or she, being in such a position, used all due diligence to prevent the contravention by the corporation. 
          
           
         
        
       (2) A person may be proceeded against and convicted under a provision pursuant to subsection (1) whether or not the corporation has been proceeded against or been convicted under that provision.  
        
        
       (3) Nothing in subsection (1) prejudices or affects any liability imposed by a provision of this Act or the regulations on any corporation by which an offence against the provision is actually committed. 
        
         
        
       (4) In the case of a corporation that is a local council, a member of the council (in his or her capacity as such a member) is not to be regarded as a director or person concerned in the management of the council for the purposes of this section. 
       
      
    5 Each of the charges as originally framed has been amended. The defendants have pleaded guilty to the amended charges and this judgment is concerned only with the question of penalty. 
    6 Each of the charges was, essentially, in identical terms. I set out hereunder the charge in its ultimate amended form brought against Scott Jackson under s 8(1) of the Act, which relates to a breach directed to the employees of the corporate defendant. The charge is that the defendant, being a director of S&P Jackson Pty Ltd (“the corporation”), by virtue of s 26(1) of the Act is taken to have contravened s 8(1) of the Act:  
     
      
       
       in that the corporation, being an employer, on 17 June 2006, at Lots 1-4 O’Keefe Drive, Coffs Harbour in the State of New South Wales (“the premises”) 
        
        
       FAILED TO 
        
        
       ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all its employees, and in particular, Brendan Currie, contrary to section 8(1) of the  
       Occupational Health and Safety Act 
        2000. 
        
        
       The particulars of the charge are: 
        
        
       (a) At all material times the defendant was a director of the corporation. 
        
        
       (b) The corporation failed to maintain a safe system of work in relation to accessing the dust extraction unit, requiring work at a height of approximately 15 metres, at the Asphalt Batching plant at the premises, in that an adequate risk assessment was not conducted prior to commencement of the work. 
        
        
       (c) (Omitted)  
        
        
       (d) The corporation failed to provide adequate information and instruction to its employees in that it: failed to provide adequate documents to its employees to assess the permissible lifting load and requirements in relation to lifting personnel in a work box, and failed to provide adequate instruction in the completion of a risk assessment for this task. 
       
      
    7 Essentially, the particulars of the charge with respect to each of the matters are identical. That is, an allegation of failure to maintain a safe system of work and an allegation of a failure to provide adequate information and instruction etc. 
    8 There was tendered into evidence an agreed statement of facts, which I reproduce hereunder: 
     
      
       
       1. The prosecutor is an inspector duly appointed under Division 1 of Part 5 of the  
       Occupational Health and Safety Act 
        2000 (“the Act”) and empowered under section 106(1)(c) of the Act to institute proceedings in these matter. 
        
        
       2. At all material times S & P Jackson Pty Limited trading as North Coast Cranes (ACN 107 771 335), a corporation, whose registered office is situated at 226A Harbour Drive, Coffs Harbour in the State of New South Wales (“the corporate defendant”), being an employer, on 17 June 2006, at Lots 1-4 O’Keefe Drive, Coffs Harbour in the State of New South Wales (“the premises”) failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all its employees, and in particular, Brendan Currie, contrary to section 8(1) of the  
       Occupational Health and Safety Act 
        2000 (“the Act”). 
        
        
       3. At all material times the corporate defendant, being an employer, on 17 June 2006, at the premises failed to ensure that persons, other than its employees, in particular, Matthew Coote, were not exposed to risks to their health or safety arising from the conduct of the corporate defendant’s undertaking while they were at the corporate defendant’s place of work, contrary to section 8(2) of the Act. 
        
        
       4. At all material times Scott Jackson of 141 Edinburgh Street, Coffs Harbour in the State of New South Wales (“the Defendant Director”), being a director of the corporate defendant, by virtue of section 26(1) of the Act is taken to have contravened s8(1) of the Act, in that the corporate defendant, being an employer, on 17 June 2006, at the premises failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all its employees, and in particular, Brendan Currie, contrary to section 8(1) of the Act. 
        
        
       5. At all material times the Defendant Director of 141 Edinburgh Street, Coffs Harbour in the State of New South Wales, being a director of the corporate defendant, by virtue of section 26(1) of the Act is taken to have contravened s8(2) of the Act, in that the corporate defendant, being an employer, on 17 June 2006, at the premises failed to ensure that persons, other than its employees, in particular, Matthew Coote, were not exposed to risks to their health or safety arising from the conduct of the corporate defendant’s undertaking while they were at the corporate defendant’s place of work, contrary to section 8(2) of the Act. 
        
        
       BACKGROUND 
        
       6. At all material times the corporate defendant, trading as North Coast Cranes, operated a business in Coffs Harbour supplying cranes.  
        
        
       7. At all material times the defendant director was the sole director of the corporate defendant. 
        
        
       8. On or about 2 February 2004, the corporate defendant purchased the “North Coast Cranes” business from Lindsay Brothers Plant and Equipment Pty Ltd. This included the purchase of assets in the form of four cranes, including a mobile crane described as a 15 tonne Tadano Crane (“the crane”).  
        
        
       9. At all material times the corporate defendant owned and supplied for hire the crane. The crane component had been commissioned in or about 1981 or 1982 and was fitted to a 1979 Ford truck base. 
        
        
       10. At the material times the crane was more than 24-years-old. The corporate defendant’s employees undertook daily visual inspections of the crane. This was usually performed by the crane driver. 
        
        
       11. The corporate defendant also ensured that quarterly minor maintenance such as oil and lubrication changes were performed on the crane.  
        
        
       12. At all material times the corporate defendant employed employees to operate plant, including the crane. 
        
        
       13. At all material times the corporate defendant employed Brendan Currie (“Mr Currie”) as a dogman and crane driver. 
        
        
       14. At all material times the corporate defendant employed Mark French (“Mr French”) as the crane driver of the crane. Mr French was a qualified crane driver, dogman and rigger. 
        
        
       15. At all material times Bitupave Limited, trading as Boral Asphalt (“Boral Asphalt”) conducted the operation of an Asphalt Batching Plant at the premises. 
        
        
       16. At all material times Boral Construction Materials Group Limited employed production employees performing work at the Asphalt Batching Plant at the premises. 
        
        
       17. At all material times Boral Construction Materials Group Limited employed Matthew Coote (“Mr Coote”) as a Grade 4 Plant Operator at Boral Asphalt’s Asphalt Batching Plant at the premises. 
        
        
       18. On 17 June 2006, Mr Currie and Mr Coote, suffered serious injuries as a result of a fall of approximately 15 metres whilst they were working from a personnel box (“workbox”) that was suspended from the crane (“the incident”). 
        
        
       19. At the time of the incident the crane’s fly jib was attached to the main jib.  
        
        
       20. The crane was suitable for the performance of the work required to be performed with the fly jib attached.  
        
        
       21. The incident occurred as a result of a failure in the hydraulics and/or controls of the crane causing the workbox to fall to the concrete pavement at the site. It is not known what caused the failure in the hydraulics and/or controls of the crane. A hypothesis proposed by Paul Kiem of Newstart Assessments Pty Ltd t/as Paul’s Crane Inspections, an accredited inspector, is that a foreign object was momentarily caught in a valve seat, causing the valve to remain open for a short period of time.  
        
        
       TASK TO BE PERFORMED 
        
       22. During the week prior to 17 June 2006, Boral Asphalt had arranged for Mr Coote to perform a task that involved the clearing of a blockage in the dust extraction unit of the Asphalt Batching Plant at the premises.  
        
        
       23. The work required cutting into a duct in the dust extraction unit to clear the blockage. The duct was to be cut by Mr Coote using an oxyacetylene cutter and a rod used to clear the blockage. The blocked duct was located approximately 15 metres above ground level and was not able to be accessed via the dust extraction unit itself.  
        
        
       24. Boral Asphalt initially sought to hire an 80 foot boom lift from another company to perform the task. However, such a unit was unavailable to perform the task on 17 June 2006. As a result Boral Asphalt determined to utilise an alternative method of using a workbox suspended via a crane to perform the task on 17 June 2006.  
        
        
       25. On the afternoon of the 16 June 2006 Boral contracted the corporate defendant to provide a crane and workbox to enable access by Mr Coote to the blocked duct at approximately 15 metres above ground level.  
        
        
       SYSTEMS OF WORK BEFORE THE INCIDENT ON 17 JUNE 2006 
        
       26. The corporate defendant failed to maintain a safe system of work in relation to the process of accessing the dust extraction unit requiring work at a height of approximately 15 metres at the Asphalt Batching plant, in that an adequate risk assessment was not conducted prior to the commencement of work.  
        
        
       27. North Coast Cranes did not have a written procedure for determining what piece of plant was appropriate to safely perform a particular task when a prospective client contacted them. In particular, there was no written procedure requiring North Coast Cranes to obtain from prospective hirers, details of the task to be performed including the height, radius of work to be carried out and weights to be lifted, prior to determining the appropriate piece of plant to perform the task. Nor was there a written procedure requiring that a pre-hiring inspection of the site be undertaken by North Coast Cranes in respect to short duration special tasks, including lifting of persons in workbox via a mobile crane. 
        
        
       28. The process adopted was essentially an informal one. 
        
        
       29. The corporate defendant’s system did not require it to enquire of a prospective hirer of a crane and workbox, whether an assessment had been made of the appropriateness and necessity to lift persons in a work box via a mobile crane and whether another reasonably practical method to perform the task was available and, if so, why it was not being utilised. 
        
        
       30. On 16 June 2006, John Lulham (“Mr Lulham”), North Coast Cranes Assistant Manager, was the “person-in-charge” in relation to the corporate defendant.  
        
        
       31. Mr Lulham had commenced in the role of Assistant Manager for the corporate defendant in approximately February 2006. Mr Lulham did not perform this role on a full time basis, but primarily performed this role in the absence of the Defendant Director. Mr Lulham was a qualified Dogman and had approximately 6 years experience in the ‘Crane Industry’. 
        
        
       32. Mr Lulham was the person who spoke to Boral Asphalt regarding the contracting of the crane from North Coast Cranes. Mr Lulham was the person responsible for the selection of the crane to perform the task at the Boral Asphalt plant.  
        
        
       33. Mr Lulham states that Boral Asphalt did not specifically request any size crane for the particular task required in 17 June 2006.  
        
        
       34. Mr Lulham did not request formal job specifications from Boral Asphalt as to the task required to be performed by the corporate defendant’s employees and non-employees. 
        
        
       35. Mr. Lulham states that North Coast Cranes were not advised by Boral Asphalt as to the approximate estimate of the reach of the crane that may be required to perform the task prior to contracting of the crane/equipment.  
        
        
       36. Mr Lulham determined what item of plant should be utilised to perform work in relation to the task.  
        
        
       37. Mr Lulham provided basic instructions to Mr Currie and Mr French as to what work was required to be undertaken the next day.  
        
        
       38. The defendant’s system did not require it to explicitly establish the experience of its crane drivers and dogmen in relation to the task of lifting and suspending of persons in a workbox via a mobile slewing crane. 
        
        
       39. Mr Currie had worked as a crane driver of non-slewing mobile cranes in Queensland for a period of three years. During this time he had, on multiple occasions, operated a fixed crane and workbox as a crane driver. However, this was a different type of crane and workbox to that involved in the incident. Mr Currie had obtained his OHS Certification qualification as a dogman on or about 13 May 2006. He had not worked as a dogman in a workbox previously. The corporate defendant was aware of his qualifications and general experience. 
        
        
       PERFORMANCE OF THE TASK 
        
       40. On 17 June 2006, the corporate defendant supplied the crane and a workbox. The corporate defendant also supplied a crane driver, Mr French and a dogger, Mr Currie with the crane to Boral Asphalt. 
        
        
       41. The corporate defendant had a ‘Daily Crane Operator Checks’ document that the Crane Driver was required to complete at or prior to the commencement of the use of the crane. Mr French did not complete the “Daily Crane Operator Checks” document for the crane on 17 June 2006. 
        
        
       42. Mr. French obtained from the corporate defendant a copy of a ‘Crane or Derrick Suspended Work Platforms' document and ‘North Coast Cranes Suspended Work Platform Worksheet' (“the Worksheet”). 
        
        
       43. On 17 June 2006, Mr French and Mr Currie attended the premises and commenced to set up the crane. 
        
        
       44. As part of the set up process, Mr French partially completed a generic ‘Pre Work Risk Assessment and Safe Work Method Statement’ document. This document formed part of the corporate defendant’s ’Tax Invoice’. Mr French did not have this document read and signed by the Site Foreman or Client’s Representative.  
        
        
       45. Mr. French then commenced to undertake the assessment of the ‘permissible lifting load’ as was required by the Worksheet. 
        
        
       46. Mr. French was not provided with any oral instruction as to the completion of the Worksheet by the corporate defendant.  
        
        
       47. The Worksheet document was inadequate. 
        
        
       48. Mr. French failed to fully or adequately complete the Worksheet prior to commencing the task of suspending persons in the workbox via the use of the crane. 
        
        
       49. The Worksheet required that a “Platform and Rigging Proof Test” and a full cycle trial lift be performed before the task was performed with personnel in the workbox. Mr French did not perform a “Platform and Rigging Proof Test” or perform a full cycle trial lift, before the task was performed with personnel in the workbox.  
        
        
       50. The Worksheet required that the relevant “Foreman” complete a section of the form attesting to the need for using a suspended work platform. This was not completed by the relevant “Foreman’. 
        
        
       51. Whilst setting up the Crane Mr French identified that the crane did not have adequate reach for the workbox to be hung safely from the main jib. Mr French determined to utilise the fly jib extension section of the crane, which meant that the workbox would be attached to the auxiliary winch.  
        
        
       52. On 17 June 2006, during the set up stage, Mr French identified that the anti-two block unit on the auxiliary winch of crane was getting caught on the cables of the crane. The anti-two block unit ensures that the hook block does not hit the boom/jib or top sheave when the hoist is being raised. The catching of the anti-two block unit on the cables of the crane could cause the anti-two block unit to come in contact with the boom/jib or top sheave and cause an alarm. If the alarm failed to work the weight on the anti-two block could be pulled through the sheave and dislodge the cable.  
        
        
       53. Mr French disconnected the anti-two block. Mr French states that the workbox would at all times be well below the sheave and the sheave was observable by Mr French from the cabin of the crane.  
        
        
       54. The crane clutch lever is located on the right hand side of the drivers seat. It has three positions, auxiliary, off and main. The three settings are inset and the lever was spring loaded towards the insets. The crane clutch lever did not have a catch installed, known as a positive lockout, which required the driver of the crane to manually remove a pin or latch to allow the clutch lever to be moved from one position to another. 
        
        
       55. Upon arrival of the crane at the Boral Asphalt site an inspection of the area where the work was to be performed was conducted. A suitable site was selected for the crane to be operated from. The crane was then set up by Mr French, while Mr Currie returned to North Coast Cranes to collect the workbox and deliver it to the Boral Asphalt site.  
        
        
       56. Once the crane and workbox were properly set up, Mr. Currie and Mr. Coote entered the workbox. Mr Currie, as dogman, was required to be in the workbox to assist the crane driver in manoeuvring the workbox. 
        
        
       57. Mr. French then proceeded to lift the workbox into position near the dust extraction unit at a height of approximately 15 metres. 
        
        
       58. Another Boral employee, Mr Mick Taylor, was working on the screen deck of the Asphalt Batching plant. It was part of Mr Taylor’s role to supply tools and equipment as required by Mr Coote to utilise whilst he was working from the workbox. 
        
        
       59. Mr Currie and Mr Coote were suspended in the workbox at a height of approximately 15 metres for approximately 20 to 30 minutes when Mr Currie advised the crane driver, Mr French, to lower the workbox approximately 1 metre so that Mr Coote could access another section of the duct.  
        
        
       60. As the clutch pressure had fallen, apparently due to the length of time that the crane had been inactive and because this model crane was not equipped with an accumulator, Mr French proceeded to take the workbox up approximately half a metre in order to activate the crane clutch. Then in order to position the workbox to a lower height Mr French released the hoist brake. 
        
        
       61. At this point the incident occurred. 
        
        
       62. As the workbox fell, it collided with part of the exhaust extraction unit and a fence on the way down. Due to mechanical resistance in the crane working mechanism, the workbox did not freefall.  
        
        
       63. The task of accessing and clearing the duct in the dust extraction unit of the Asphalt plant was successfully completed by Boral Asphalt with equipment supplied by another supplier the following weekend after 17 June 2006. 
        
        
       DEFENDANT DIRECTOR 
        
       64. The defendant director had a hands on, day to day role in the management of the corporate defendant. 
        
        
       65. He was familiar with the plant owned and operated by the corporate defendant, including the servicing requirements and the need for major inspections. He was also familiar with the qualifications of employees, and the operation of the plant. 
        
        
       66. The defendant director was away on holidays at the time of the incident. He did not have any role in the selection of the plant used on the day of the incident. 
        
        
       67. The defendant director had a direct role in the systems of work developed by the corporate defendant, in relation to the systems for maintenance of plant, and in relation to instruction of employees of the corporate defendant.

    10 During the course of the hearing, a supplementary agreed statement of facts was tendered into evidence, which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       SUPPLEMENTARY AGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS 
        
        
       1. There was a risk of a fall of the workbox which arose from: 
        
        
         
         (a) the failure to have an adequate task specific risk assessment; 
          
          
         (b) the provision of inadequate documents to assess the permissible lifting load; 
          
          
         (c) the failure to provide adequate documents as to the requirements in relation to lifting personnel in a workbox; and 
          
          
         (d) the failure to provide adequate instruction in the completion of a risk assessment for the task. 
          
         
        
       2. The above listed failures increased the risk of the workbox falling to the ground as they removed layers of safety designed to prevent the risk of the workbox falling to the ground. 
       
      
    11 It is important to point out at this stage that [21] of the agreed statement of facts makes it clear that there was no evidence as to what caused the failure in either the hydraulics and/or the controls of the crane which in turn caused the workbox to fall. In this context, the prosecutor acknowledged that any factual matter which was adverse to the interests of the defendants would need to be proven to the criminal standard and that there was simply insufficient evidence to allow any conclusion to be made as to the reason why this unfortunate incident occurred.  
    12 It was for this reason that the supplementary agreed statement of facts was prepared and the reason why [2] of that document is framed in the manner in which it is. It is for this reason also that there is no specific allegation contained within the particulars of the charge to the effect that the incident which occurred resulted from any particular omission or conduct of the corporate defendant. 
    13 Documentary evidence was tendered on behalf of the defendants. In an affidavit, Scott Jackson described, inter alia, the standard procedures utilised by the corporate defendant at the time of the accident that were designed to comply with its occupational health and safety obligations. Mr Jackson readily conceded that there had not been any inspection of the site where the work was to be carried out before the day of the particular job. However, he said that the particular crane had been used at those premises before and was seen to be suitable for use in them having regard to its small wheelbase and reach. He also conceded that a representative of Boral had not signed a site safety induction form prior to the job being completed and that other forms had not been completed in their entirety, or had been completed incorrectly. Nevertheless, I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence of Mr Jackson that the personnel engaged to perform the work for the corporate defendant that day were experienced, were generally well-trained and instructed and that they were attentive to the occupational health and safety risks which accompanied the particular work to be performed. Furthermore, it was the evidence of Mr Jackson that a number of changes to the company’s work practices had been implemented after the incident, firstly at the request of the prosecutor and more latterly of its own initiative. 
    14 Mr Jackson said that the corporate defendant was experiencing some financial difficulties as a result of the general downturn in the building industry and that he was endeavouring to sell the business and resume work as a sole contractor.  
    15 Mr Jackson was of particular concern about the impact that any conviction would have upon the corporate defendant in terms of its ability to secure work especially from large organisations and upon himself in terms of his requirement to disclose any personal conviction when entering a foreign jurisdiction, and in particular the USA and some Asian countries. 
    16 It was the evidence of Mr Jackson, his father, mother and long-standing partner that the incident which gave rise to these proceedings has had a profound effect on him personally and that he had become withdrawn and subject to mood swings. I am satisfied that the incident and its sequelae have had a profound effect upon Mr Jackson and that he has been sincere in his expression of remorse and contrition concerning the occurrence. Furthermore, he has formed a close personal relationship with one of the injured persons and has gone to some lengths to enquire about the welfare of the other person. 
    17 Character references and other material indicate that Scott Jackson is a person of good character and that the defendant corporation is a good corporate citizen.  
    18 Finally, there is evidence, as conceded by the prosecutor, that the defendants co-operated fully with the WorkCover Authority in and about its investigation of the incident and in compliance with its requests for improvements to the occupational health and safety processes used by the corporate defendant. 
    19 The commencing point for the assessment of penalty is the objective seriousness of each of the offences. Obviously, each breach of the Act must be regarded seriously, having regard to the objects of the legislation. However, there are also, obviously, degrees of seriousness. The defendants submitted that, viewed objectively, these breaches were in the lower order of seriousness and the prosecutor did not contend otherwise. I agree.  
    20 In essence, the particulars of the charge allege a failure to carry out particular matters in a particular way. The risk assessment was said to have been incomplete because of the failure to visit the site and the failure to evaluate the risks associated with the work and to complete certain documentation. As against this, the corporate defendant’s personnel were familiar with the site. Furthermore, there was said to be a failure to provide information and instruction to employees to ensure that these matters were attended to. However, all of these failures occurred in the context of existing systems, procedures and documentation, which albeit not perfect, were in operation. Some of the omissions may also be sheeted home to Mr French who had failed to complete some of the forms correctly. Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the risks created by these omissions “removed layers of safety” but, on the evidence, did not themselves cause the incident which occurred. 
    21 When considering the objective seriousness of the offence, the focus of attention must be on the offence as charged in the context of the relevant factual matrix. Furthermore, there must be a causal nexus between the conduct of the defendants and the offences with which they are charged.  
    22 All of this will require an evaluation of the available factual material. In considering the factual material, I should also refer to the established principles that deal with the onus and standard of proof in connection with the fact-finding process involved in the sentencing component of criminal proceedings. There is a discussion about these matters in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ in the High Court of Australia in R v Olbrich (1999) HCA 54; 199 CLR 270. At [25] and [27], their Honours said: 
     
      
       
       [25] Much of the discussion of fact finding for the purposes of sentencing addresses questions of onus and standard of proof. References to onus of proof in the context of sentencing would mislead if they were understood as suggesting that some general issue is joined between prosecution and offender in sentencing proceedings; there is no such joinder of issue. Nonetheless, it may be accepted that if the prosecution seeks to have the sentencing judge take a matter into account in passing sentence it will be for the prosecution to bring that matter to the attention of the judge and, if necessary, call evidence about it. Similarly, it will be for the offender who seeks to bring a matter to the attention of the judge to do so and, again, if necessary, call evidence about it. (We say “if necessary” because the calling of evidence would be required only if the asserted fact was controverted or if the judge was not prepared to act on the assertion.)  
        
       (Footnotes omitted) 
        
        
       … 
        
        
       [27] As to the standard of proof that should be applied, we would adopt what was said by the majority in  
       R v Storey 
        [1998] 1 VR 359 at 369 (per Winneke P, Brooking and Hayne JJA and Southwell AJA) - that a sentencing judge 
        
        
         
         “may not take facts into account in a way that is  
         adverse 
          to the interests of the accused unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if there are circumstances which the judge proposes to take into account  
         in favour 
          of the accused, it is enough if those circumstances are proved on the balance of probabilities.” 
         
        
       
      
    23 I should refer also briefly to the decision of the High Court of Australia in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. The Court concluded that in the circumstances of those proceedings, and in criminal proceedings generally, the sentencing process must be directed to the manner in which the charge is framed. If, for example, it is asserted by the prosecutor that the particular proceedings constitute an aggravated example of the offence, the prosecutor is required to prove the facts that establish that conclusion beyond reasonable doubt.  
    24 The conduct, whether by way of act or omission, asserted against the defendants in the charges brought against them is concerned with a failure to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all of the employees of the corporate defendant and in particular the two named persons. In that these are directed essentially to a failure to maintain a safe system of work and the failure to provide adequate information and instruction, they are directed to a “state of affairs” (per Doyle CJ in the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Diemould Tooling Services Pty Ltd v Oaten (2008) 174 IR 80; [2008] SASC 197 at [31]), a situation. And, as pointed out by Doyle CJ, it is necessary that the employee or employees “must be shown to be affected by the contravention, because of the failure to ensure …” 
    25 In that, essentially, the prosecutor relied upon the material in the supplementary agreed statement of facts, which I have reproduced at [10] above, it is the “risk of a fall” which must be measured in order to assess the objective seriousness of the offence.  
    26 Obviously, the workbox may have fallen as a result of some event external to the equipment, by the manner in which the equipment was operated, or some innate failure of the equipment itself, or a combination of all or any of these. However, these are causes that may only be the subject of speculation given the factual circumstances surrounding these proceedings. Furthermore, the focus of attention must be directed to the material in the supplementary agreed statement of facts that refers to an increased risk of the workbox falling because layers of safety designed to prevent such a risk were removed because of the four matters set out in [1] of the supplementary agreed statement of facts.  
    27 The difficulty that I have in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence is that any determination about the nature and extent of the risk itself and, more importantly, an increase in that risk by reason of the matters referred to in [1] must be a matter of speculation. The only factual material before the Court is that which I have previously set out. Any matter that is adverse to the interests of the defendants must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt as is plain from the decision of the High Court in Olbrich, to which I have earlier referred. There is no appropriate evidence about the nature of the risk and the extent of any increase in that risk.  
    28 In all the circumstances, I conclude that I am unable to determine the extent to which the risk of the workbox falling may have been increased by reason of any of the matters set out in [1] of the supplementary agreed statement of facts with sufficient precision and in a manner that cannot be described as speculative. In all the circumstances, I am unable to conclude that I could appropriately impose any penalty other than that involving the payment of a nominal fine. 29 I have given consideration as to whether I should have the proceedings relisted for the purpose of receiving submissions about whether, in all the circumstances, I should contemplate the application of the provisions of s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the provisions of which are set out later in these reasons for judgment. I have determined that I would not take this step in the proceedings not only because I was not asked to do so by any of the parties but also because there were clear failures on the part of the corporate defendant, as conceded, which would in all the circumstances render the application of s 10 of that Act problematic.  
    30 In assessing penalty, I shall also take into account the general and specific deterrent effect that any penalty will have. The operation of mobile cranes is always accompanied by inherent dangers. Even though Mr Jackson has indicated that he wishes to sell the business being conducted by the corporate defendant, it nevertheless continues to operate within the building industry.  
    31 The defendants are entitled to have certain mitigating factors taken into account. Pleas of guilty were entered after a stage had been reached where significant amendments to the charges had been agreed upon between the parties and I would assess the relevant discount which would apply in these circumstances as being of the order of 20 per cent. Furthermore, there are other mitigating factors that should be taken into account including co-operation with the prosecutor in and about her enquiries, expressions of remorse and contrition and evidence of an overall commitment to occupational health and safety obligations.  
    32 The prosecutor submitted that the Court should have regard to the principle of totality when determining the appropriate penalty to be imposed for each of the offences. The defendants embraced this submission. In circumstances where both of the charges levelled against both the defendants arose out of the same set of circumstances and where charges brought under ss 8(1) and 8(2) arose simply because there was an employee and a non-employee of the corporate defendant working the same workbox, it is appropriate, in my opinion, to apply the principle of totality and I intend to do so. 
    33 The personal defendant submitted that he should have the benefit of the application of s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       10 Dismissal of charges and conditional discharge of offender 
       
      
      
       
       (1) Without proceeding to conviction, a court that finds a person guilty of an offence may make any one of the following orders: 
        
        
         
         (a) an order directing that the relevant charge be dismissed, 
          
          
         (b) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding 2 years, 
          
          
         (c) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into an agreement to participate in an intervention program and to comply with any intervention plan arising out of the program. 
          
         
        
       (2) An order referred to in subsection (1) (b) may be made if the court is satisfied: 
        
        
         
         (a) that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment (other than nominal punishment) on the person, or 
          
          
         (b) that it is expedient to release the person on a good behaviour bond. 
          
         
        
       (2A) An order referred to in subsection (1) (c) may be made if the court is satisfied that it would reduce the likelihood of the person committing further offences by promoting the treatment or rehabilitation of the person. 
        
        
       (2B) Subsection (1) (c) is subject to Part 8C. 
        
         
        
       (3) In deciding whether to make an order referred to in subsection (1), the court is to have regard to the following factors: 
        
         
          
         (a) the person’s character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition, 
          
          
         (b) the trivial nature of the offence, 
          
          
         (c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed, 
          
          
         (d) any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider. 
          
         
        
       (4) An order under this section has the same effect as a conviction: 
        
        
         
         (a) for the purposes of any law with respect to the revesting or restoring of stolen property, and 
          
          
         (b) for the purpose of enabling a court to give directions for compensation under Part 4 of the Victims Compensation Act 1996, and 
          
          
         (c) for the purpose of enabling a court to give orders with respect to the restitution or delivery of property or the payment of money in connection with the restitution or delivery of property. 
          
         
        
       (5) A person with respect to whom an order under this section is made has the same right to appeal on the ground that the person is not guilty of the offence as the person would have had if the person had been convicted of the offence. 
       
      
    34 It is clear, as the prosecutor submitted, that the application of s 10 of that Act will only be available in rare and limited circumstances in relation to proceedings brought for a prosecution of the provisions of the Act. The prosecutor referred me to WorkCover Authority (NSW) (Inspector Maddaford) v Coleman (2004) 138 IR 21 and Inspector Downie v Menzies Property Services Pty Ltd [2004] 136 IR 449. The prosecutor accepted, however, that the exercise of discretion to apply s 10 was available to be considered by the Court in the circumstances of these proceedings. 
    35 It was submitted on behalf of Mr Jackson that there were a number of matters that would militate towards the exercise of discretion in his favour. These included the fact that he had worked in the building industry for over 30 years without, seemingly, any prior convictions for breach of occupational health and safety legislation, that he was a person of good character, that he was the sole shareholder of the corporate defendant and any fine imposed on the corporate defendant would ultimately be borne by him in terms of its depleted assets, that the breaches arose in some measure by the failure of an employee, Mr French, to carry out his required tasks appropriately, that the offence was at the low end of seriousness, and the extent to which he was personally affected by the incident. 
    36 It was also submitted by Mr Jackson that if a conviction was recorded against him, this would hamper his ability to travel. He said,  
     
      
       
       “I am a keen international sailor, and a criminal conviction will affect my ability to obtain entry visas to a number of countries. My partner and I were planning to travel to the United States next year, and I fear that a conviction will prevent me from entering the country.” 
       
      
    37 Solicitors for both the prosecutor and Mr Jackson filed affidavits after making enquiries about the possible impact of a conviction on the ability of Mr Jackson to obtain a visa for travel to the USA. The information obtained was to the effect that a “previous arrest or conviction” would affect entry into the United States. Information contained on the website of the US Department of State said in relation to a previous arrest or conviction that  
     
      
       
       “In most cases, it makes you ineligible for the visa waiver program which means you must apply for a visa instead. In some cases, a previous arrest or conviction might also make you ineligible for a visa, although, depending on the nature of the offence and its outcome, a consular officer may find it appropriate to recommend a waiver of this ineligibility.” 
       
      
    38 I doubt that the matter can be taken further than acknowledging that any conviction recorded against an individual for a breach of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, whether as an employer etc or by reason of the application of s 26 of the Act, such conviction will need to be disclosed to US immigration authorities and may need to be disclosed to the authorities of other countries requiring such a disclosure. Whether and to what extent any such conviction might impact upon an ability to obtain a visa or to otherwise enter a country will obviously depend upon the circumstances applying to the conviction and the attitude of the relevant authorities in each jurisdiction. 
    39 However, the mere fact that a person has committed a criminal offence and is therefore exposed to conviction that might impact upon a person’s ability to obtain authority to travel to other countries should not, in my opinion, of itself influence a court in determining whether to impose a conviction. In making this assertion, however, I am conscious that the general criminal courts have afforded some leniency in circumstances where a conviction for a relatively minor offence might impact upon the ability of a person to seek admission to practise as a legal practitioner and the like. I do not regard the ability of Mr Jackson to travel overseas as falling in the same category as a young student charged with a relatively minor offence of the kind that some university students habitually face. I am not persuaded that this fact either taken alone or in conjunction with any other fact should mandate the application of s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
    40 Nevertheless, there are other matters that do, in the aggregate, persuade me that it is appropriate to apply that provision to Mr Jackson’s circumstances. Of most importance in this regard is the fact that I have characterised the offences with which the corporate defendant is charged as warranting the imposition of nominal penalties only. Furthermore, as is plain from the evidence, the corporate defendant is the manifestation by which Mr Jackson operates the business and he will, in effect, be responsible for meeting any financial penalty imposed on the corporate defendant. Accordingly, any penalty imposed on the corporate defendant will be transformed into a loss borne by Mr Jackson as the sole shareholder of the corporate defendant. However, in referring to this matter I should not be seen to ignore the fact that the legislature has seen fit to create a separate and distinct offence under s 26 of the Act which militates, in my opinion, against accepting any such argument as being the sole basis for the application of s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
    41 There are a number of other matters that, in the aggregate, persuade me that in the circumstances of these proceedings s 10 of that Act should be applied. They are the matters referred to in [35] which I have set out above. 
    42 Having regard to all the matters to which I have referred, I assess an appropriate penalty for the corporate defendant for each of the charges levelled against it in the sum of $5,000 each. 
    43 Having regard to the application of s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I intend finding Scott Jackson guilty of each of the offences with which he is charged but will discharge him on condition that he enter into a good behaviour bond for a term of 3 months. 
    44 The prosecutor sought, and the defendants did not oppose, an order for a moiety of the penalty to the prosecutor and an order for costs in favour of the prosecutor.  
    Orders 45 I make the following orders: 
     
      
       
       1. S&P Jackson Pty Ltd is found guilty of each of the charges brought against it and convicted accordingly. 
        
       2. I impose a penalty of $5,000 for each of the charges with a moiety to the prosecutor. 
        
       3. I find Scott Jackson guilty of each of the offences with which he is charged. I order that he be discharged on condition that he enter into a good behaviour bond for a term of 3 months. 
        
       4. S&P Jackson Pty Ltd is to pay the costs of the prosecutor in all of these proceedings in an amount assessed by the Court in default of agreement.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Sean Issa and Yousif Yousif appear for sentence today having each pleaded guilty at an earlier stage to an offence of aggravated kidnapping, the circumstance of aggravation being that they were in company. That is a very serious offence demonstrated by the fact that the maximum penalty provided by the legislature is twenty years imprisonment.2 They each asked that when I sentenced them for that matter I take into account another matter on the Form One and that is an offence of demanding money with menaces, also in company. Were that to be dealt with separately the maximum penalty for that offence would be fourteen years imprisonment.3 These two offences arose out of the events of 7 June 2007. In the statement of facts tendered on behalf of the Crown relating to each accused there is a significant amount of information which sets out the preliminary events to these two offences.4 It appears what occurred is that a man by the name of Abraham Mavlian then aged twenty years had some difficulties with another group of men not involving these accused. The difficulties, if I can call them that, came to a head and Mr Mavlian was assisted by a group of Assyrian men. Once matters were resolved it appears that someone decided that Mr Mavlian would have to pay for the services of the Assyrian men. Indeed he handed over $1,000 that night. It is clear that the offenders had nothing to do with that transaction. They came in afterwards.5 Having believed the whole unfortunate events were over, Mr Mavlian was disabused of that impression when he got a phone call. It came from a man named Alan Khamis. Mr Mavlian was told that he had to come down to Fairfield because “the boss” wanted to speak to him. Mr Mavlian replied that he had already paid $1,000 and thought it had all been sorted out. 6 In the early hours of the following morning he got another phone call from Mr Khamis. He was again told to come to Fairfield. A threat was made to Mr Mavlian in these terms: 
     
      
      “Get to fucking Fairfield now or I’ll fucking shoot you and your fucking family.” 
      
    7 It is not suggested that either accused was involved in that threat or that telephone call. However it explains why Mr Mavlian would leave the safety of his home and drive to Fairfield. There he met up with a group of six Assyrian men. There was also a Commodore motor vehicle driven by a man by the name of Gorges. 8 Mr Issa, one of the two accused in the present matter, was also there. So was the other offender Mr Yousif. Mr Khamis was there as well. Mr Mavlian was directed to drive into an alley. He did what he was told. One of the men was seated in the passenger seat of his car. When he got into the alley he saw the other five men, including the two present offenders, approach him. Thus the two present offenders were in a position to see and participate in what later occurred.9 Mr Mavlian was pulled out of his car by Mr Gorges. He was pushed up against a roller door. Mr Gorges produced a knife which he presented towards Mr Mavlian. He grabbed Mr Mavlian’s neck with one hand and held up the knife with the other. Demands for money were then made. One of the unknown men said that they were not cheap and asked Mr Mavlian how much money he had. He said he did not have much money and repeated what he had earlier said, that he had already paid $1,000. Mr Gorges told Mr Mavlian that he wanted $20,000 and pushed him harder with the knife still in his hand. There were then some negotiations. In an attempt to get out of the very threatening situation in which he found himself Mr Mavlian lied, telling the men that he had $13,000 which he could provide. The large group of men seemed to have settled on $13,000.10 The demanding of that money with the menaces I have just described represents the offence on the Form One relating to each offender. What occurred later represents the offence for which the offenders must be sentenced. 11 Mr Mavlian was then dragged again by Mr Gorges over to the Commodore, which I have mentioned earlier. Mr Mavlian was told to get in the Commodore and that someone else would drive his car. The offender in this matter, Mr Issa, was the one who drove Mr Mavlian’s car with Mr Khamis in the passenger seat. The remaining men including Mr Yousif got into the Commodore. During the journey Yousif and two other unknown men kept telling Mr Mavlian “you better have the money, you better not be fucking us around.” He was also hit around the head by each of the passengers in the car including of course Mr Yousif. Mr Gorges said “we will fuck you if you don’t have the money.”12 Not surprisingly Mr Mavlian was terrified at what he had heard. These were violent men. One of them was armed with a knife. They were prepared to not only threaten violence but to inflict it upon him in the Commodore. Of course part of his terror was no doubt related to the circumstance that he did not have $13,000 to give them. These were unpredictable, aggressive men and the victim Mr Mavlian was completely at their mercy. They did not demonstrate any mercy however. 13 Indeed at one stage Mr Mavlian was put in a headlock and his jumper was pulled over his head. As if this was not bad enough, at one stage the car was stopped and someone said “this guy is fucking us around. Look I don’t need the money. Let’s just get rid of this guy.”  Clearly that was meant and interpreted by Mr Mavlian as a threat to kill him. It is worth repeating that Mr Yousif was in the car, Mr Issa was not.14 As the car turned into the street where Mr Mavlian lived he again had a jumper put over his head and felt a hard object placed against his head. Someone said “You’d better not fuck us around. You better get us the money. You didn’t see us or anything and it will be all over.” He was allowed out of the car. He had been there for about twenty-five minutes. All the other men got out. The hard object which Mr Mavlian thought might have been a gun was put against his hip and one of the men said “You better not fuck us around you’ve got two minutes.”15 Mr Mavlian then walked over to the car that Issa had been driving. He got into that car and drove the short distance to his home. Mr Khamis remained in the front passenger seat of that car as he did so. Finally Mr Mavlian was able to reach the sanctuary of his home. His parents were awake waiting for him. He told them what had happened and the police were immediately called. The men hadn’t given up however. Mr Mavlian’s sister and mother heard tapping on the windows and the front door and a voice yelling out “give us the fucking money.” 16 Police managed to stop the Commodore soon afterwards and they arrested a number of men including the two offenders. They participated in electronic recorded interviews with the police in which they denied the allegations. Of course those denials are now to be treated as being false in view of the pleas of guilty entered by the appellants.17 One of the most important matters in assessing the seriousness of an offence is the harm that that offence causes. In this case of course the harm which Mr Mavlian felt is most important. He says that he was subject to a terrifying ordeal and he did not know that anything like that could ever happen. He said he had never experienced such fear and such terror. He was convinced that he was going to die.18 Those emotions are entirely foreseeable. The two offenders must have known they were causing a high level of fear and indeed terror in the mind of Mr Mavlian. In fact that is precisely what they wanted to occur. They wanted him to be frightened so that he would provide them with some money. Also foreseeable is the effect on Mr Mavlian in the longer term. Although the Victim Impact Statement he prepared is dated two years after the incident, he says that still to this day he is experiencing flashbacks to that night and the events that occurred. He says he is continuously worried for his safety when he leaves his house and he worries about the safety of his family also. He says: 
     
      
       
      “I live in constant fear and cannot enjoy myself or relax in any way when I am outside my home. When I am at home I worry about who is approaching the house and worry about any strange vehicles or any people who may be walking past. I feel paranoid now and I was never like that prior to this incident.” 
      
    19 He says that he can see no end in sight to these feelings and he describes it as if he has been given a life sentence of his own.20 As I said the consequences for Mr Mavlian were entirely foreseeable and to a large extent intended by the two offenders. That must be firmly borne in mind when I assess the appropriate sentence for both men. 21 Mr Yousif has no prior convictions. He is twenty-two years of age and the youngest of seven children. He was born Iraq and came to Australia about eleven years ago when he was twelve. His parents separated about five years ago and he remained living with his mother. He cared for his mother in many ways, assisting her with her medical condition, she being an insulin dependant diabetic, and also assisting her as an interpreter.22 He left school in year 11. He remained there for that long because it was what his parents wanted. He realised he was not going to do well at school so he left and has not pursued any other training or studies since then. At school he found some subjects hard but did well in others. He told a psychologist that since he left school he could not find a job and went on to unemployment benefits. Eventually he got a job in a factory making building products but was asked to leave when the work dried up. He then worked in a pizza shop but that also did not last. He worked for his sister Kim as a cleaner but again that job ceased because of lack of work. He is now unemployed and supported by his family. 23 One significant positive matter in his favour is an aspect of his personality referred to in references tendered on his behalf, in particular he performs valuable service for the unfortunately named Granville Rage Soccer Club. 24 Mr Issa, in contrast to Mr Yousif does have a criminal history and appearing on it is a very significant matter indeed. In 2004 he was dealt with for an offence of ongoing supply of drugs for which he received a sentence of four years imprisonment. There are other less serious matters on his criminal history as well. 25 Mr Issa was born in Sydney, he is the second oldest child in his family, his parents are Assyrian migrants from Iran. The offender told Dr Jacmon that his relationships with his parents were good, although Dr Jacmon expressed some doubt as to whether he could accept what Mr Issa was saying for reasons which I could never identify. 26 The offender left school in year 10 and worked for his father, however he was argumentative, lacked focus and inattentive and so on regular occasions he would stop working for his father and return later. He was diagnosed with diabetes in 2002 and formed a relationship with a woman in 2003. However he was then sent to prison for the offence that I have referred to and his relationship with this woman broke up. He then began to gamble which resulted in depression and anxiety. He became part of a group of youths of Assyrian background, that group, including the co-offender and the other men who kidnapped Mr Mavlian on that night. 27 Dr Jacmon says that Mr Issa suffers from a borderline personality disorder and ADHD. The Crown Prosecutor cross-examined Dr Jacmon to suggest that in fact he did not have a borderline personality disorder and the Crown submitted that I would prefer the evidence of Dr Allnutt who did not agree with Dr Jacmon’s conclusion. I do not need to resolve whether I should favour the opinion of the psychologist, Dr Jacmon, or the psychiatrist, Dr Allnutt. Even if he does suffer from those two conditions it may be that he is less able to control his offending behaviour but does that mean that the sentence should be more lenient (or more severe). It may suggest that he is deserving of leniency because his behaviour is harder for him to control, but if it does then personal deterrence becomes of more importance. 28 Dr Jacmon gave evidence. He agreed that in almost every one of the reports he prepares for courts a sentence similar to this appears: 
     
      
       “Mr Issa’s actions which led to offending reveal highly impaired judgment because there appeared to be little thought given to the consequences.”  
      
     It was his opinion that at least to some extent everyone who commits a crime demonstrates highly impaired judgment. In those circumstances, it would not be surprising that Dr Jacmon told me that the conclusion that I have just read out does appear in almost every one of his reports. Dr Jacmon seems to be saying that anyone who commits a crime has impaired judgment because they might get caught. 29 It has to be said that I do not accept that opinion at all. Many offenders adopt a completely rational thought process. Indeed one can see exactly what the offenders were hoping to achieve in this case. They wanted money and they thought that by threatening Mr Mavlian and kidnapping him they could get it. No doubt they felt confident that having threatened Mr Mavlian with a knife, threatened to kill him and terrified him as they did, he was going to hand over the money and not go to the police. Just because they were wrong about what Mr Mavlian did does not mean that they had highly impaired judgment. 30 I am also prepared to accept, in relation to Dr Jacmon’s report, that Mr Issa is a follower rather than a leader but both generally and as regards this offence once more personal deterrence must be borne in mind. Even “followers” who commit serious criminal offences deserve serious punishment and it may well be and it is in this case that he needs to be deterred more if he is unable to extricate himself from the position he puts himself in because he is a follower. 31 Both offenders pleaded guilty but at a late stage. Indeed the pleas were only entered after the trial was due to commence. There is therefore a utilitarian value in the pleas but that is of limited value. Some court time would have been saved but witnesses were ready, the prosecution was ready, and court time had been allocated. In those circumstances a discount of ten per cent or approximately that, is the most that I can allow.32 One of the issues which is of course relevant concerns the question of parity. I must ensure that neither offender has a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence I impose on him with the sentence I impose on his co-offender. In this case I will accept what Mr Galluzzo said and that is that there is a balancing out of some factors, such that they should effectively receive the same sentence. Whilst Mr Yousif was more involved, he being in the car, and he actually hitting the victim, his client was younger and did not have a criminal record. Those matters to my mind do balance each other out such that the sentences imposed on the offenders will be identical.33 In each case I take into account that the offenders were subject to stringent bail conditions. In Mr Yousif ‘s case they were relaxed over time. These conditions included a curfew and daily reporting. I am able to take those into account and indeed I should in assessing the appropriate sentence. 34 Counsel for both offenders asked me to make findings in favour of their clients, that they were remorseful. That is very difficult to do in the absence of evidence from the offenders themselves. In Mr Issa's case, he is not assisted by Dr Jacmon’s failure to actually bring along any notes he may have made as to what Mr Issa said on the question of remorse and was forced to rely on Dr Jacmon's summary, Dr Jacmon’s interpretation of what was said. In any case Mr Issa did not expose himself to cross-examination on that issue and so I give little weight to Dr Jacmon's summary of what the offender said for those two reasons. In Mr Yousif’s case Mr Galluzzo clearly acknowledged that much of what he said on the question of remorse came only from the Bar table. I am unable to find that the offenders are remorseful.35 Similarly I am unable to find that they have good prospects of rehabilitation, that is not to say they have no prospects but I cannot find that they are good. The circumstances of this offence themselves suggest that that is the case. It may be that, and it probably is, Mr Yousif’s prospects of rehabilitation are better than Mr Issa’s given the lack of his criminal history. In each case I have to assist their rehabilitation by imposing a sentence on them which will personally deter them from acting this way in the future. I do consider that they would both benefit from an extended period of supervision on parole. For that reason I will make a finding of special circumstances in their favour.36 These offences were very serious. It is to be remembers that I am sentencing not only for the aggravated kidnapping matter but taking into account the demand money with menaces matter as well and the sentences that I will shortly announce will have to be looked at in that light. 37 It is also to be borne in mind that these offences were committed out of pure greed. This group of men was prepared to terrorise Mr Mavlian simply because they wanted some money. They cared nothing for how he was feeling and regarded him simply as a means by which they could unjustly enrich themselves. The time during which Mr Mavlian was held captive was twenty-five minutes, not a long period, but not an insignificant one either, but for each of those twenty-five minutes he was in great fear. 38 It is a fundamental rule of sentencing that a sentence imposed on an offender reflect the objective gravity of the offence. As I have to have made clear, this was a very serious offence indeed and has had lasting consequences for the unfortunate Mr Mavlian.39 Sean Issa is sentenced as follows, he is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of three years to date from 3 January 2008 and a head sentence of five years. He is entitled to be released to parole on 2 January 2011.40 Yousif Yousif he is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of three years to date from 18 August 2009 and to expire on 17 August 2012. I set in his case a head sentence of five years also.

    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Davies J. 
     
      
    2 R A HULME J: I agree with Davies J. 
     
      
    3 DAVIES J: On 30 October 2008 the Applicant Wayne Mack pleaded guilty to the following offences: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: Cultivate by enhanced indoor means a prohibited plant, namely cannabis, being a quantity of 68 plants for a commercial purpose – s 23(1A)  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         1985 (maximum penalty 15 years or a fine of 3500 penalty units or both); 
         
         
        Count 2: Supply a prohibited drug, namely cannabis oil, in an amount of 183.6 grams – s 25(1)  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         1985 (maximum penalty 15 years or a fine of 2000 penalty units or both); 
         
         
        Count 3: Unauthorised possession of 7 firearms in circumstances of aggravation – s 51D(2)  
        Firearms Act 
         1996 (maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment – standard non-parole period of 10 years). 
        
       
      
    4 In sentencing the Applicant for the offence in count 3 the Judge took into account, at the Applicant’s request, his guilt in respect of 4 further offences listed in a Form 1 document as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Form 1:  
         
          
          (1) Supply a prohibited drug (4717 grams cannabis leaf) – s 25(1)  
          Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
           1985 (maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment or 2000 penalty units or both); 
          
         
         
          
          (2) Supply a prohibited drug (123.85 grams of cannabis resin) - s 25(1)  
          Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
           1985 (maximum penalty 15 years imprisonment or 2000 penalty units or both); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (3) Unauthorised possession of prohibited weapon (Rhino crossbow) – s 7(1)  
          Weapons Prohibition Act 
           1998 (maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment); 
          
         
         
          
          (4) Stealing motor vehicle (quad bike farm vehicle) – s 154F  
          Crimes Act 
           1900 (maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment). 
          
         
        
       
      
    5 On 27 November 2008, his Honour Acting Judge Woods QC sentenced the Applicant Wayne Mack as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1, sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months, the sentence being deemed to have commenced on 26 March 2007 with the non-parole period expiring on 25 September 2008; 
         
         
        Count 2, sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 26 March 2008 with the non-parole period expiring on 25 March 2010; 
         
         
        Count 3, (taking into account the Form 1) sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing on 26 September 2009 with the non-parole period expiring on 25 September 2012. 
        
       
      
    6 The Judge sentenced the Applicant Wayne Mack in respect of Court 1 on the mistaken belief, induced by the representative of the Crown, that the maximum penalty was 10 years imprisonment or 2000 penalty points or both. That is the penalty for an offence under s 23(1)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 for the cultivation of a prohibited plant. However, the offence charged was, in its terms, an offence under s 23(1A) of the Act which was the offence of cultivating by enhanced indoor means a number of prohibited plants. The penalty under s 23(1A) where the prohibited plants are cannabis is provided for in s 33(2)(b) by virtue of s 33(1)(a). The penalty for an offence under s 23(1)(a) for cannabis is provided for in s 32(1)(h) by virtue of s 32(1)(a). This mistaken belief on the part of the sentencing judge does not affect the outcome of this application for leave to appeal.  
     
      
    7 The Applicant Wayne Mack seeks leave to appeal on 4 grounds as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. The sentence imposed upon count 2 was too severe and some other lesser sentence is warranted. 
       
       
      2. The sentence imposed upon count 3 was too severe and some other lesser sentence is warranted. 
       
       
      3. His Honour erred in his assessment and application of Part 4 Div 1A  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       1999 for count 3. 
       
       
      4. His Honour erred in fixing the commencement dates for counts 2 and 3 by failing to have proper regard to the totality of the circumstances of the offences. 
       
      
    8 The Applicant Annette Mack pleaded guilty to two counts on 13 November 2008 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: Cultivate by enhanced indoor means a prohibited plant, namely cannabis, being a quantity of 68 plants for a commercial purpose – s 23(1A)(b)  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         1985 (maximum penalty 15 years imprisonment or 3500 penalty units or both); 
         
         
        Count 2: Unauthorised possession of 4 firearms in circumstances of aggravation – s 51D(2)  
        Firearms Act 
         1996 (maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment – standard non-parole period of 10 years). 
        
       
      
    9 In sentencing the Applicant for the offence in count 2 the Judge took into account, at the Applicant’s request, her guilt in respect of 1 further offence listed in a Form 1 document as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Form 1:  
         
         
          
          (1) Supply a prohibited drug (4717 grams of cannabis leaf) – s 25(1)  
          Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
           1985 (maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment or 2000 penalty units or both); 
          
         
        
       
      The 4 firearms were the first 4 of the 7 in respect of which the Applicant Wayne Mack was charged.  
       
      
    10 On 27 November 2008 his Honour Acting Judge Woods QC sentenced the Applicant Annette Mack as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1, imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months, commencing 27 November 2008 with the non-parole period expiring 26 May 2010; 
         
         
        Count 2, (taking into account Form 1) imprisonment for 3 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 27 November 2009 with the non-parole period expiring 26 November 2011. 
        
       
      
    11 Again, the Judge sentenced the Applicant Annette Mack in the belief that the maximum penalty for count 1 was 10 years and 2000 penalty units or both. 
     
      
    12 The Applicant Annette Mack seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
      1. The sentence imposed upon count 2, possession unlicensed/ unregistered firearms, was too severe and a lesser sentence was warranted. 
       
       
      2. His Honour erred by imposing a custodial sentence. 
       
       
      3. His Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. 
       
       
      4. His Honour erred in his assessment in his application of Part 4 Div 1A  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       1999. 
       
       
      Background to the offences 
       
      
    13 On 26 March 2007 Police executed a search warrant at a property owned by the Applicants at Lot 78 Bunbury Road, Bocoble, a village outside Mudgee. At the premises Police found: 
     
      
       
        A room in which 51 cannabis plants were being grown hydroponically and 17 other cannabis plants; 
       
       
        A quantity of cannabis leaf (4.7 kilograms); 
       
       
        Cannabis oil and resin; 
       
       
        A large number of firearms (including rifles, pistols and other prohibited firearms and ammunition); 
       
       
        A stolen quad bike; 
       
       
        $11,000 in cash together with items associated with the cultivation and sale of cannabis. 
       
      
    14 Lot 78 Bunbury Road, Bocoble is a single storey 3 bedroom house situated on 25 acres near the small village of Bocoble. There were on the property a number of sheds and a number of unregistered car bodies.  
     
      
    15 On the date the search warrant was executed, 26 March 2007, the property was occupied by Annette Mack and her two children, a daughter then aged 16 and a son, then aged 12. At that time, the Applicants were estranged with Wayne Mack being absent from the property for periods of time. On 26 March, however, he was found hiding on the property later that day.  
     
      
    16 The police found a small room attached to one of the spare bedrooms to the premises. Inside this small room was an established hydroponic cannabis plant bed containing 51 small cannabis plants growing separately in individual pots. These plants were irrigated by black hosing and there were two interior lights sources on at the time of the plants being located. The light source was controlled by a timer in the power point. The plant bed area was enclosed by reflective foil. Fourteen cuttings of small cannabis plants were additionally found within the hydroponic area. 
     
      
    17 In one of the cupboards within that room there were dry cuttings of cannabis within plastic bags and around the cupboard. The room had string across the ceiling line and a light within the cupboard to create a drying area.  
     
      
    18 A number of firearms were found in both the room containing the hydroponic setup and an adjoining room.  
     
      
    19 The police searched Wayne Mack’s motor vehicle and found a loaded .357 Magnum calibre shortened revolving rifle. 
     
      
    20 The following day the police executed a further search warrant on a property in Crudane Road, Crudane (near Mudgee) owned by the Applicants. The property is remote rural bushland with the only dwelling on it being a caravan. The caravan contained various quantities of ammunition, 2 rifles and a silencer.  
     
      
    21 In total the police found at the properties and in Wayne Mack’s vehicle 13 unregistered firearms, 5 prohibited firearms and 2 silencers, 1 firearm registered to a deceased person and 4 other registered firearms in a gun cabinet. It is noted, however, that the Applicant Wayne Mack was only charged with possession of 5 firearms and the Applicant Annette Mack was only charged with possession of 3 firearms. Count 3 in relation to the Applicant Wayne Mack and count 2 in relation to the Applicant Annette Mack included references to silencers. However, silencers are neither firearms nor prohibited firearms within the definitions contained in s 4 and Schedule 1 of the Firearms Act 1996. 
     
      
    22 Both the Applicants held current shooters licenses.  
     
      
       
      Appeal by Wayne Mack 
       
      
    23 The sentencing judge noted that the Applicant was aged 42 years and had no criminal history. His Honour noted that the Applicant’s father and grandfather had been interested in firearms and that the Applicant had been a member of a gun club in Wollongong where he was born and raised. After he moved to and purchased some land near Mudgee, the Applicant continued his interest in guns and did work in the Mudgee district eradicating feral animals such as pigs. At various times he had a licence for certain firearms. He had some registered firearms and had been an authorised user of firearms for feral animal eradication.  
     
      
    24 The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing but evidence was given by his mother. She gave evidence that one of the silencers found at the property had been made for the Applicant by his grandfather when the Applicant was a teenager to enable him to shoot rabbits without the rabbits hearing the noise of a gun. She gave evidence that he had held a gun licence from his teen years. No explanation was given for the possession of the second silencer.  
     
      
    25 His mother also gave evidence explaining why he carried a loaded revolver in his motor vehicle. She said it was in connection with the trapping of pigs. It was necessary to have a loaded revolver in case one of the pigs attacked the dogs used to assist in the trapping of pigs. She gave evidence that his grandfather, his father and his uncle had all collected guns. 26 His Honour made no findings about the Applicant’s drug use. His mother’s evidence was that she did not know that he or Annette smoked marijuana although, since their arrest, they had told her that they did. 
     
      
    27 It was in the light of that background that his Honour came to sentence the Applicant.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – sentence imposed on count 2 was too severe 
       
      
    28 Count 2 was the offence of supplying a prohibited drug being cannabis oil in the amount of 183.6 grams. The sentence was a total term of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing from 26 March 2008 and expiring on 25 March 2010.  
     
      
    29 His Honour made what must be regarded as non-controversial statements about the cultivation and supply of drugs, the harm to the community from them and the need for sentences that act as a general deterrent.  
     
      
    30 When coming to the particular offences charged, his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “With respect to the drug offences the law states ten and fifteen years and it is not a matter of court categorising the type of drugs, the legislation has already done that so I am bound to consider the penalty as stated by the law as the benchmark for the most serious cases and then refer to the statistics to ascertain the appropriate range. 
         
         
        The statistics are limited. For enhanced cultivation the statistics show a range of six months to eighteen months for the non-parole period which does seem very low considering the overall effect of any drugs in our society today. But I am also considering the matters on the Form 1 which in themselves are serious. I will consider a period of eighteen months for the non-parole period for the enhanced cultivation.  
        For the supply which comes under a provision with a higher maximum I would have to consider a period of two years non-parole.  
        This would be arrived at by starting at a term of four years with allowance for the plea of guilty taking it to three years and then an allowance for his no prior involvement with the law meaning I can consider good prospects for rehabilitation in finding a non-parole period of two years.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    31 In fact, as I have pointed out earlier, the maximum penalty in terms of imprisonment for the advanced cultivation was the same as the maximum penalty for supply. But on the basis of what the sentencing judge and the parties believed was the maximum under count 1, the applicant submits, nevertheless, that simply because there was a higher maximum penalty for count 2 did not mean that a higher sentence was required. This was because the offence charged in count 2 was objectively less serious so that a lesser sentence was warranted.  
     
      
    32 In Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357 the High Court was dealing with the approach taken by this Court in a Crown appeal against an inadequate sentence for a charge of supplying heroin in an amount not less than the commercial quantity for that drug – 415g. The Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 provided for a variety of maximum periods of imprisonment depending on the quantity of the drug involved. In relation to heroin, where the quantity is less than 250g and the matter is dealt with on indictment the maximum penalty is 15 years imprisonment. Where the quantity is not less than 250g but less than 1000g it is 20 years imprisonment and where the quantity is not less than 1000g it is life imprisonment. 
     
      
    33 In the course of re-sentencing the offender, Hulme J (with whom Heydon JA and Carruthers A-J agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Had the [appellant's] offence and circumstances fallen within the category of a worst case falling within the statutory provisions, the sentence should have been not less than the 15 years maximum for the offence of supplying an indictable quantity. I appreciate that the charge specified a commercial quantity, that the maximum period of imprisonment prescribed for that offence is 20 years and that the quantity involved in this offence was only a little more than 40 per cent of the maximum commercial quantity.  
        However, Parliament cannot have intended that, other things being equal, the penalty for supplying more than 250 g should be less than for supplying that quantity. 
        ” (emphasis added) 
         
         
        
       
      
    34 Of the highlighted statement the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[31] …The form of the statement is explained by the fact that his Honour did not start with the maximum penalty for an offence involving the quantity in question, but used another maximum penalty as his starting point, that is, the maximum for an offence in the category of seriousness immediately below that of the principal offence.  
         
         
        … 
         
         
        [33] A serious fallacy in his Honour's reasoning is that it assumes that any case involving more than 250g of heroin is likely to be a worse case than any case involving only 250g or less. That cannot be so in the virtually absolute terms in which his Honour puts it. … Having started with a penalty which would have been appropriate for the worst possible kind of offence of supply involving up to 250 grams of heroin, Hulme J made no attempt to identify the nature of such a case and to make a comparison of the facts of the principal offence with it.” 
        
       
      
    35 What the sentencing judge said in the passage I have highlighted in para 30 above was ambiguous. His Honour could simply have been noting the higher maximum penalty in respect of count 2 without reasoning, as was contended by the Applicant, that for that reason alone he had to impose a higher penalty. However, one matter supporting the Applicant’s contention is that the sentencing judge did not discuss anything in particular relating to the objective seriousness of each of the offences of cultivation and supply to enable a proper comparison between them.  
     
      
    36 Nevertheless, if the sentencing judge made an error in this regard his error in relation to the maximum penalty on count 1 worked in the applicant’s favour. I do not consider that either the non-parole period, nor the term of imprisonment ordered in relation to count 2 was outside the appropriate range of discretion of the sentencing judge.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – sentence on count 3 too severe 
       
       
      Ground 3 – error in applying Part 4 Div 1A of the Act 
       
      
    37 His Honour imposed a term of imprisonment of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 26 September 2009 and expiring 25 September 2012.  
     
      
    38 His Honour drew attention to the maximum penalty of 20 years and the standard non-parole period of 10 years and said that they highlighted how seriously the legislature and the community saw the unauthorised possession of firearms. His Honour went on, correctly, to refer to R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 to note the correct approach in relation to sentencing where there is a standard non-parole period. In this regard his Honour said that the standard non-parole period can be seen as a reference point for a mid-range case “although not necessarily the starting point”. 
     
      
    39 However, what his Honour did not do was to follow the approach to sentencing required by Part 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and as explained in Way, R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575 at [32] – [34] and MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; 164 A Crim R 93 at [28] – [38]. In particular, his Honour did not determine in the first instance the level of objective seriousness of the offence, although it can probably be inferred that his Honour took the view that it was to be assessed at less than the middle of the range of objective seriousness because his Honour said he would start at eight years non-parole before reducing it for particular matters.  
     
      
    40 His Honour did not, as he should have done, identify the matters which go to determining the objective seriousness of the offence. Simpson J in AJP at [13](iv) identified the factors and matters in general terms that ought to be examined. Applying those to the facts in the present matter suggests that the following would be the relevant considerations: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the number of the firearms; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the number of the firearms that were prohibited or were pistols; 
        
       
       
       (c) the nature and type of the firearms; 
       
       
       (d) the purpose for the possession of the firearms; 
       
       
        
        (e) evidence which would show any relationship between the possession of the firearms and the drug industry being carried on at the premises; and 
        
       
       
        
        (f) the location of the property and the security under which the firearms were kept. 
        
       
      
    41 The evidence about these matters can be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         There were 5 prohibited firearms; 
        
       
       
        
         For the offence in s 51D(2) to be committed it is sufficient only that there be 1 prohibited firearm with the remaining firearms referred to in the sub-section being unregistered; 
        
       
       
        
         3 of the weapons consisted of a revolver and 2 shortened rifles all of which are firearms that could be concealed; 
        
       
       
        
         The Applicant was in possession of 2 silencers, one at least of which appeared to have been a homemade silencer made by his grandfather for the purpose of shooting rabbits quietly; 
        
       
       
        
         The Applicant had long had an interest in guns, had been a member of a pistol club and had held a shooter’s licence for a number of years; 
        
       
       
        
         At least some of the firearms were used for legitimate purposes of controlling and killing feral animals; 
        
       
       
        
         There was no evidence of any criminal purpose for the possession of the firearms nor that they were used in any way connected with the drug business being conducted; 
        
       
       
        
         The finding by his Honour that there was no history of aggressive behaviour on the part of the Applicant. 
        
       
       
        
         The fact that a drug business was being conducted from the premises where the firearms were kept might be thought to increase the risk of a break-in and theft of the weapons. 
        
       
       
        
         The firearms were located on rural properties and were not properly stored; 
        
       
      
    42 In my view, the balancing of these matters points to the fact that the objective seriousness of the offence was on the lower side of the middle range of seriousness with the result that it was within his Honour’s discretion to take a starting point of eight years before the other deductions were made.  
     
      
    43 His Honour’s approach was to reduce the 8 year period to 6 for the plea of guilty (a 25 per cent reduction) and then to reduce the non-parole period to 3 years for what his Honour said was the Applicant’s clean record and the principle of totality. That was a substantial reduction but the Applicant claims that the sentencing judge, having found that the offence was less than the middle range of objective seriousness should not have allowed the standard non-parole period to have dominated the remainder of the sentencing exercise.  
     
      
    44 Although it is true that a non-parole period of 3 years for the offence is quite a bit higher than the statistics show had been given (88 per cent given 2 years or less) the statistics were those for offences to which a standard non-parole period did not apply. The standard non-parole period for an offence against s 51D(2) came into force on 1 January 2008. It applied to offences whenever committed except in the case of an offender who had, by that date, been convicted or had entered a plea of guilty which had not been withdrawn. In any event, care must be taken in the use of statistics in sentencing; Way at [140] and Graham v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 212 at [35]-[37].  
     
      
    45 It does not seem to me that his Honour did allow the standard non-parole period to dominate the remainder of the sentencing exercise. It is made clear in both Way and AJP that the standard non-parole period remains of relevance as a reference point, benchmark, sounding board or guidepost even if there are reasons for departing from it. It does not seem to me that the non-parole period set was outside the range of appropriate discretion of the sentencing judge.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4 – error in the commencement dates for counts 2 and 3, and totality 
       
      
    46 The effect of the sentences was that the Applicant received an aggregate term of imprisonment of 8½ years and an aggregate non-parole period of 5½ years. The Applicant says that for the 3 offences charged this was neither just nor appropriate and a lesser degree of accumulation was required. 
     
      
    47 His Honour said in this regard: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the matter of totality for the number of separate offences I would recognise the conjunction of the two drug offences and allow some concurrency there and then in relation to the firearms offences also allowing for some concurrency and at the end there would still be a suitable period of parole to allow for the effect of any accumulation. “ 
        
       
      
    48 His Honour accumulated count 2 by 12 months and accumulated count 3 by a further 18 months. The Applicant says that the 2 drug offences should have been accumulated only by 6 months and the firearms offence accumulated by another 6 months. This would have the effect that his non-parole period would expire on 25 March 2011.  
     
      
    49 In Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1 Howie J (with whom Price and Adams JJ agreed on this aspect of the judgment) said at [27]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… [T]here is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality.” 
        
       
      
    50 Similarly, in R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272 the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[11] …It is the application of the totality principle that will generally determine the extent to which a particular sentence is to be served concurrently or cumulatively with an existing sentence…” 
        
       
      
    51 Although the sentencing judge made reference to the matter of totality for the offences there is no indication that he approached the matter in the manner discussed in Mill v R (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 62-63, R v Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 and subsequently in Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [18]-[27]. When the principle of totality is viewed, the overall criminality of the offences did not justify a sentence of imprisonment of 8½ years and a non-parole period of 5½ years and was outside the appropriate range of discretion for the reasons that follow. 
     
      
    52 There was a close connection between the first two counts being the cultivation of the cannabis plants and the supply of cannabis oil. Indeed, given the size of the cultivation and the amounts of cash found, the main purpose of it must have been for the supply of the prohibited drug in one form or another. In making the sentences for those offences concurrent only to the extent that the sentencing judge did means that the sentence was excessive in terms of the overall criminality of the drug business being conducted by the Applicant. Compared with a number of cultivations that have come before the courts, this was a relatively small operation, and part of its reason was no doubt connected with the use of the marijuana by the Applicants. In terms of the overall criminality for the drug offences his Honour appropriately sentenced the Applicant to a longer period for count 2. But to accumulate that sentence by 12 months was outside the proper range of discretionary judgment bearing in mind the connection between the 2 offences and the longer sentence given for count 2. 
     
      
    53 Although his Honour did not find that the purpose of the possession of the firearms was related to the drug business being conducted his Honour saw it as a relevant factor that the unauthorised firearms were held by a person who was also involved in the cultivation of prohibited drugs. Further, his Honour referred to the policy of the legislature to ensure that there is no unauthorised and unnecessary proliferation of firearms. The fact that a drug cultivation business was being conducted from the premises increases the risk of the proliferation of those weapons because of the increased risk of a break-in.  
     
      
    54 In all the circumstances, a proper application of the principle of totality would have resulted in an overall sentence of 7½ years with an aggregate non-parole period of 4½ years. His Honour ought to have directed that sentences in respect of counts 1 and 2 should have been served concurrently. The result would have been, therefore, that the Applicant’s non-parole period in respect of count 2 would have expired on 25 March 2009. His Honour was not in error in accumulating the sentence for count 3 in the way he did. However, the correction to the accumulation that ought to be made in relation to the sentence for count 2 has the result that the overall sentence is reduced to 7½ years with an aggregate non-parole period of 4½ years expiring on 25 September 2011.  
     
      
      Appeal by Annette Mack 
       
      
    55 There was evidence given by Mrs Beverley Mack at the sentencing hearing to the effect that the Applicant Annette Mack was the submissive one in the marriage. The evidence was that Wayne Mack made the decisions in the family and that Annette was not a confident person and she would go along with what Wayne would suggest and was easily led.  
     
      
    56 Mrs Beverley Mack said that she had some concern as to Annette Mack’s level of intellectual function. That view receives support from the report of Mr Alex Edgar, forensic psychologist, whose testing placed Annette Mack at the top end of the Borderline range with her skills being superior to 8% of the population.  
     
      
    57 Mrs Beverley Mack’s evidence about her daughter-in-law’s submissiveness is also borne out by what Mr Edgar said in his report as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The Applicant’s] responses indicated she wants to be accepted and involved with others but is hesitant due to her fear of being rejected or humiliated by them. She likely experiences feelings of unease and anxiety and perceives herself to be socially inept and inadequate, consequently she likely undervalues her achievements and engages in self-criticism, frequently feeling alone and isolated. Her test results suggest she restricts her social environment more so since her involvement in the offences and this compounds her depressive symptomatology.” 
        
       
      
    58 Although the sentencing judge referred to the report of Mr Edgar he made no reference to his assessment of the Applicant in terms of the psychometric and personality testing conducted by him. His Honour, however, touched on this issue when he said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is submitted to me that she was only the partner of her husband in this matter [i.e. the propagation of drugs] and of course I have already dealt with her husband and that in fact it was his operation and she was in the position of a wife who had to go along. However she herself was a user of cannabis and therefore must be taken to have known exactly what was happening …” 
        
       
       
      His Honour appeared only to relate the matters raised by Mrs Beverley Mack and Mr Edgar to the drug charge.  
       
      
    59 Further information concerning the Applicant’s personal circumstances, noted by the sentencing judge, was that she was aged 45 and had no criminal history. She left home at age 20 after meeting her husband and had no contact with her own family who had largely ignored her. She left school in year 9 without any formal academic qualifications. She had been a cannabis user since 18 years of age although she had ceased using it for about 10 years after the birth of her children.  
     
      
    60 I turn now to consider the grounds of appeal which can be conveniently be dealt with as a whole since they only concern count 2 and the approach to the sentencing on that ground.  
     
      
    61 The Applicant points to two alleged errors on the part of the sentencing judge. First, it is said that his Honour aggravated the objective seriousness of the offence because he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[T]here is no evidence as to efforts made by either parent to teach the children about the proper care and security in use of firearms.” 
        
       
       
      That his Honour thought this issue was important can be seen from his return to the same point where he said: 
       
       
        
        “There is no evidence of how the parents were teaching the children and the levels of responsibility and care required by our society in the propagation and use of drugs and the care and security of firearms.” 
        
       
       
      In fact, this was an entirely irrelevant consideration, even if there had been evidence that the parents had not taught their children about the matters his Honour mentioned. It must be inferred that his Honour took this irrelevant consideration into account against the Applicant by reason of the fact that he mentioned it on 2 occasions.  
       
      
    62 Secondly, it is said that his Honour was in error in linking the possession of the firearms with the cultivation of the drugs as the reason for considering a custodial sentence. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the offender before me for the count on the indictment I must consider a custodial term to take account of the number of firearms involved together with the conjunction of the cultivation of prohibited drugs.” 
        
       
       
      In truth, there was no evidence linking the two things and the evidence that was given pointed the other way because the guns were said to belong to Wayne Mack and had been collected over a long period of time because of his interest in guns and his use of at least some of them for the purpose of the control of feral animals.  
       
      
    63 The important finding his Honour did make in relation to this Applicant and the guns was this: 
     
      
       
        
        “However I do feel that her possession of the firearms was in a way a flow on from the activities of her husband and that she may not be as positively involved.” 
        
       
      
    64 His Honour then went on to say that even though there was a standard non-parole period of ten years for a mid-range case, he found that her involvement would be below the mid-range of seriousness and would start at 5 years. He then reduced that to 3 years and 3 months for the plea of guilty and again reduced it to a non-parole period of 2 years because of her prior history of no involvement with the law. 
     
      
    65 It seems to me that in coming to a view about the objective seriousness of the offence his Honour ought to have considered the following matters: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the evidence pointed strongly to the fact that the firearms belonged to the Applicant’s husband Wayne and her liability in relation to the offence arose only from the joint ownership and occupation of the premises; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the offence was at the lower end of the range when the number of firearms is considered, particularly given that the silencer should not have been included as a prohibited firearm; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) there was no evidence that the firearms were connected in any way to the drug business; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) there was a finding by his Honour in the remarks on sentence for both this Applicant and the husband that there was no history of aggressive behaviour on the part of either of them that might be relevant to the possession of the weapons. 
        
       
      
    66 If these matters had been properly considered, his Honour ought to have assessed the objective seriousness of the offence at the lower end of the range. His Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence was an error. In these circumstances, since I have formed the view that some other sentence should have been passed (s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912) I believe there is a need to re-sentence.  
     
      
    67 The offence in count 2 is, generally speaking, one of considerable gravity having regard to the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period that have been prescribed by Parliament: see, for example, R v Oliver (1982) 7 A Crim R 174 at 177. The Applicant has contended that the sentencing judge erred by imposing a full-time custodial sentence for this offence. Despite my view that the objective seriousness is in the lower range, the need for denunciation and general deterrence dictates that no sentence other than one of full-time imprisonment should have been imposed. In my opinion, and having particularly in mind the matters in para 65 above, the appropriate sentence on count 2 is a sentence of 12 months with 9 months non-parole. Thereafter, the appropriate approach to the totality principle is to sentence the Applicant in respect of count 2 and to accumulate that sentence upon the sentence for the drugs offence by 6 months. The total effective sentence will thereby be one of 3 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years. 
     
      
    68 The records of the Department of Corrective Services disclose that the Applicant was held in custody from 27 March to 4 April 2007 when she was released on bail. This was not drawn to his Honour’s attention. In the circumstances, the sentence for the first offence should have been backdated by 9 days to 18 November 2008.  
     
      
       
      Proposed orders re Wayne Mack 
       
      
    69 In my opinion the following orders should be made: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (2) Uphold the appeal. 
       
       
      (3) Confirm the sentence for count 1. 
       
       
      (4) In relation to count 2, confirm the term of the sentence including the non-parole period but order that the sentence commence on 26 March 2007. The non-parole period will expire on 25 March 2009. 
       
       
      (5) In relation to count 3, confirm the term of the sentence including the non-parole period but order that the sentence commence on 25 September 2008. The Applicant will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 25 September 2011. The total term will expire on 25 September 2014. 
       
       
      Proposed orders re Annette Mack 
       
      
    70 In my opinion the following Orders should be made: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
        
       
       
       (2) Uphold the appeal. 
       
       
        
        (3) In relation to count 2, quash the sentence and in lieu thereof the Applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 9 months with a balance of the term of the sentence of 3 months. The sentence to commence on 18 November 2008 with the non-parole period expiring on 17 August 2009. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) In relation to count 1, confirm the term of the sentence including the non-parole period but order that the sentence commence on 18 May 2009. Direct the release of the Applicant on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period expiring on 17 November 2010. The total term will expire on 17 May 2012.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MACFARLAN JA: The applicant pleaded guilty to an offence under s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to Stephen Belcher on 27 October 2007. The maximum penalty for the offence is ten years imprisonment with the standard non-parole period being four years (see s 54D Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). On 22 August 2008 the applicant was sentenced by Hock DCJ to imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of one year and ten months. 
     
      
       
      Factual circumstances 
       
      
    2 The circumstances in which the offence occurred were described by the sentencing judge in her Remarks on Sentence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 27 October 2007 the victim Mr Stephen Belcher was at the Bushranger Hotel at Largs with some friends. Mr Belcher had his right arm in plaster as he had broken his thumb playing rugby… [The offender was also drinking in the same establishment with a group that] comprised Mr Reid, Mr James and Mrs Pat Spooner, the offender’s father and mother, the offender and his twin brother. 
         
         
        … [Some members of the group containing the offender were observed by Ms Sullivan, the manager of the Hotel, to have been antagonising and acting aggressively towards Mr Belcher and members of the group that he was with]. Ms Sullivan then directed Mr Spooner and his family to leave the hotel, and Mrs Spooner encouraged this. They began to leave.  
         
         
        Unfortunately, about that time Mr Belcher and his friends also left, although a short time afterwards. When he left, Mr Spooner was confronted by Mr Belcher and one of his sons. Mr Spooner and Mr Belcher were arguing and Ms Sullivan saw that they were pushing each other. She walked across to them and stood between them. She then heard a glass smash and saw the offender punch Mr Belcher in the face with a glass in his hand. Mr Belcher was struck directly to his left eye and his face and his eye began to bleed profusely. Despite this, the offender and the other Spooner males continued to yell at him and his friends, inviting them to fight, swearing and shouting at them. They left the Hotel when Ms Sullivan told them that the police had been called. 
         
         
        Mr Belcher was taken … to Maitland hospital where he presented with a laceration to the left side of his nose and a penetrating wound to his left eye … A piece of glass, 3 centimetres by 3 centimetres was removed from the nose wound … He was transferred to John Hunter Hospital for emergency surgery. He suffered … complications with poor vision and extensive corneal damage and iris trauma … He underwent [further] surgery [and] continued to have complications … Mr Belcher now has [lost the use of his left eye and has] an artificial intraocular lens”. 
        
       
       
      The Sentencing Judge’s Reasoning 
       
      
    3 The sentencing judge described the offence as a “most serious and, disturbingly, not uncommon offence”. She noted that Mr Belcher had suffered scarring to his face and the loss of his left eye and went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “Aggravating features of the offence are that it involved the use of a weapon, namely, a glass. However, I accept the offender’s evidence that he did not deliberately arm himself with the glass but had it in his hand at the time he swung the blow and acted in that way because of his intoxication. The prosecution could not establish beyond reasonable doubt that the glass was smashed before the offender swung the hand holding it, as the Crown Prosecutor fairly conceded. Of course, had that been the case the offender would probably be facing an even more serious charge. 
         
         
        I accept that the offence was not premeditated and it came about because of the offender, in his intoxicated state, wrongly perceived that his father was being threatened.”  
        
       
      
    4 Her Honour then turned to subjective considerations. She noted the following: 
     
      
       
        
         The applicant turned 18 years of age only a few months before the offence and on the night of the offence was having his first drink with his family in licensed premises. 
         The evidence established that he was not the type of young man who frequently became intoxicated. 
         His employer was supportive of him and gave evidence that he will re-employ the applicant on his release from custody.  
         The applicant expressed remorse for his actions and apologised sincerely to the victim, his family and friends. 
         A psychologist gave evidence that the applicant has “symptoms of an adjustment disorder with a mixed anxiety and depressed mood as a function of his concerns over his actions on 27 October”. 
         The applicant has good prospects of rehabilitation. 
        
       
      
    5 Her Honour discounted the applicant’s sentence by 25 percent to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty and found that because he would benefit from a longer period of supervision on his release from what would be his first period in custody, special circumstances existed for the purposes of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    6 Her Honour did not consider that there were any sentencing statistics that were of assistance to her task. 
     
      
    7 As to the fixing of the non-parole period, the judge said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “I come now to consider whether it is appropriate to impose the standard non-parole period. I am of the view that this offence is above the mid range of objective seriousness for an offence of this type. While there was no premeditation and only a single blow was struck, the consequences for the victim have been life changing; that is, he has lost the sight of one eye at age twenty-three. Tasks such as driving are more difficult for him, quite understandably. He has lost the opportunity for employment in some particular fields. He has had to undergo a number of operations and will need further treatment. 
         
         
        However, I have determined that the standard non-parole period should not be imposed for the following reasons; first, the plea of guilty; second, the offender’s youth and good prospects for rehabilitation; third, the finding of special circumstances. Of course, the standard non-parole period is still relevant as a reference point in coming to the ultimate sentence, and I have considered it as such.” 
        
       
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    8 In support of his application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him the applicant relies upon the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The sentencing Judge erred in failing to make a finding that the applicant did not intend the use of the glass in the incident. 
        
       
       
        
        2. It was not open to her Honour to conclude that the offence was above the mid range of objective seriousness. 
        
       
       
      3. The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      Ground 1: Intention to use the glass 
       
      
    9 Counsel for the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge did not make, but should have made, a finding as to whether or not the applicant intended to hit Mr Belcher with the glass. She submitted that the prosecution did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the applicant intended the use of the glass and referred to evidence given by the applicant during his examination in chief before the sentencing judge that he did not intend to use the glass. She also referred to the following portions of the Record of Interview of the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q.144 You hit him once? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. 145 And then you swung around with your other hand? 
         
        A. Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. 146 What hand did you have the glass in? 
         
        A. My left hand. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. 147 O.K. Were you going to hit him with that hand? 
         
        A. Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.148 O.K. Did you know you had the glass in your hand? 
         
        A. Well, it was just like a reaction. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. 149 Yep. 
         
        A. First you hit someone with that hand and come around, its like--- 
         
         
        Q. 150 Yep, When did you realise you had the glass in your hand? 
         
        A. When I did it. After I did it. 
        
       
      
    10 The applicant’s Counsel further submitted that the absence of a finding that the applicant intended to use the glass necessitated a conclusion that the offence was not, as the sentencing judge found, above the mid range. 
     
      
    11 I do not agree that the sentencing judge did not find that the applicant intended to hit Mr Belcher with the glass which was in his hand. Such a finding was implicit in the passage from the sentencing judge’s Remarks on Sentence quoted in [3] above. The judge found that an aggravating feature of the offence was that “it involved the use of a weapon, namely, a glass”. She could not have found that the applicant used the glass as a weapon unless she was of the view that the applicant knew he had the glass in his hand and intended to strike Mr Belcher with it. Consistently with that view her Honour found in the following sentence that “the applicant did not deliberately arm himself with the glass but had it in his hand at the time he swung the blow and acted in that way because of his intoxication”.  
     
      
    12 That her Honour simply referred to the use of the glass as a weapon without stating an explicit finding that the applicant was aware that the glass was in his hand at the relevant time is understandable in light of the content of the applicant’s submissions on sentence. Counsel for the applicant relied upon written submissions which included statements that “the offence involved the reckless use of a glass as a weapon” and that “the offender regarded himself as being provoked – although there was no a to warrant his use of the glass against the victim” (sic). The latter passage contained a typographical error: the words “no a” appear to have been intended to read: “nothing”. 
     
      
    13 It was not put either in these written submissions or in the oral submissions made on behalf of the applicant that the judge should find that the applicant did not intend to hit Mr Belcher with the glass. This was appropriate in light of the evidence before her Honour which included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        That after striking Mr Belcher in the eye with the glass and after Mr Belcher commenced to bleed profusely, the applicant said “How do you like that you cunt”. There was evidence of this statement in the Statement of Facts tendered at the sentencing hearing and in the uncontested evidence of a number of witnesses. Such a statement by the applicant after he had lacerated Mr Belcher with the glass was not consistent with the applicant having only intended to strike Mr Belcher with his fist and having forgotten, until he hit Mr Belcher, that he had the glass in his hand 
        
        
        That in his cross-examination the applicant said the following: 
        
       
       
        
        “Q. He was going to hit your dad-- 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. --when he got back up? 
         
        A. And that’s why I come into it and I hit him with the glass and that.” 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. There was never a time when Mr Belcher sought to strike your father, was there? 
         
        A. He was coming straight for my father. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you say that’s why you hit him with the glass? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
       
        
        The applicant later conceded that Mr Belcher was not trying to hit the applicant’s father. 
        
       
      
    14 As the sentencing judge did in fact find that the applicant intended to use the glass and that finding was reasonably open to her Honour, the first ground of appeal cannot succeed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Objective seriousness of offence 
       
      
    15 The applicant’s submissions in relation to this ground were largely dependent upon Ground 1 succeeding. In light of the fact that her Honour found that the applicant used the glass as a weapon and, as I have said above, thereby implicitly found that he was aware that he had the glass in his hand when he struck Mr Belcher and when account is taken of the seriousness of the injury to Mr Belcher, it is clear that her Honour’s assessment of the offence as above the mid range was not in error. In addition to the seriousness of the injury and the use of the glass as a weapon, the fact that the victim was vulnerable because he was unarmed and had an arm in a plaster cast and that the group of which the applicant was a part were the aggressors in the confrontation which occurred were matters supporting her Honour’s conclusion.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3: Whether the sentence was manifestly excessive 
       
      
    16 The sentencing judge referred to the decision in R v Willett (NSWCCA, 21 August 1998, unreported) where the applicant was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment including a minimum term of 15 months for a “glassing” offence. Her Honour commented that the applicant there had “a more powerful subjective case than this offender, and the injury was less severe”. These comments were in my view correct and no error has been shown in the way in which her Honour dealt with Willett’s case.  
     
      
    17 The applicant contended that his case was more like that considered in R v Davies [2007] NSWCCA 178 where “the swing at the victim was a reflex response to a perceived threat and … the use of the glass was not intentional”. As is apparent from what I have said above, the present case is different because the sentencing judge found that the glass was used as a weapon. As well, the injury suffered by the victim in that case was not nearly as serious as in the present case. In these circumstances, the decision to impose a suspended sentence of 10 months (the subject of an unsuccessful Crown appeal) is not of assistance to the applicant in the present case. Furthermore, the offence to which Mr Davies pleaded guilty was one with a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment (s 35 Crimes Act 1900). The offence to which the present applicant pleaded guilty was one having a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. Section 35(2) of the Crimes Act, pursuant to which the present applicant was charged, only came into operation on 27 September 2007, exactly one month before the offence was committed. 
     
      
    18 Also relevant is the decision is Sayin v R [2008] NSWCCA 307 in which the applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, for which the prescribed maximum penalty was imprisonment for seven years. No standard non-parole period was applicable. A sentence was imposed in the District Court of five years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years. In that case, the offender punched a glass into the victim’s face in a public bar. The injuries suffered by the victim were considerably less than those suffered in the present case. The sentence imposed in the District Court was quashed on appeal and the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years three months with a balance of term of one year six months.  
     
      
    19 The decision supports the view that the sentence imposed in the present case is not manifestly excessive, particularly when account is taken of the fact that the applicant in the present case was charged with an offence for which the maximum penalty was ten years, as distinct from the seven year period applicable to the offence with which Mr Sayin was charged. Indeed, Sayin would suggest that the present sentence was lenient rather than excessive.  
     
      
    20 In conclusion, I adopt the following comments made by Howie J (with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL): 
     
      
       
        
        “47 The offence, popularly known as “glassing”, is becoming so prevalent in licensed premises that there are moves on foot to stem the opportunity for the offence to be committed by earlier closing times and the use of plastic containers. The courts clearly must impose very severe penalties for such offenders, but of course within the limits afforded by the prescribed maximum penalty. In light of the fact that the maximum penalty for an offence under s 35(2), recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm, is now 10 years imprisonment, the increased maximum penalty should result in a marked increase in the penalty for offences of this nature. Had the sentence this Court is now substituting been imposed for the new offence under the  
        Crimes Act 
         with the increased maximum penalty, it would be arguably manifestly inadequate” (at [47]). 
        
       
      
    21 In my view the sentence imposed by her Honour was well within the range of sentences reasonably open on the evidence before her. Accordingly, this ground of appeal, as with the first and second grounds, cannot be sustained. 
     
      
       
      Proposed Orders 
       
      
    22 For the reasons given above, I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (2) Appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: The stated case is set out in the reasons of Harrison J. With the benefit of his Honour's reasons, with which the following assumes familiarity, I can explain with brevity my reasons for its determination. I will refer to Ryde City Council as the prosecutor and to Mr Pedras as the defendant. 
     
      
    The form of the stated case 
     
      
    2 The Court raised with the parties the unsatisfactory form of the stated case.  
     
      
    3 This Court's authority pursuant to s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is confined to determining a question or questions of law arising on any appeal to the District Court submitted by a judge of that court, and then to making appropriate orders or giving appropriate directions (including quashing any acquittal, conviction, or sentence of the District Court on the appeal). This Court can not determine any questions of fact or draw factual inferences. The facts on which this Court is to make its determination should be set out, and specific questions of law should be stated for determination. Harrison J has referred to relevant authority.  
     
      
    4 The case stated included some procedural history and some facts as found by the judge. It annexed a number of documents. The documents should not have been annexed. The terms of the penalty infringement notice and the notice of appeal to the District Court were irrelevant. If there were relevant facts appearing from the transcript of the proceedings in the Local Court or the transcript of the proceedings before the judge in the District Court, they should have been included as facts stated, and not left to be gleaned from an annexed transcript (see Madden (1995) 85 A Crim R 367 at 371). The judge's judgment should have been encapsulated so far as relevant in the facts or the questions of law.  
     
      
    5 Question 1 submitted by the judge was not appropriately framed (see Sasterawan v Morris [2007] NSWCCA 185; (2007) 69 NSWLR 547 at [15]), but did present for determination a question of law in the construction of s 13(2)(b) of the Companion Animals Act 1998, namely, whether a person not present at the time of the offence was ""in charge of the dog at that time"" within s 13(2)(b). Question 3 also sufficiently presented a question of law, namely, whether costs could be awarded to the defendant for his personal time. Question 2, however, in my view did not present a question of law for determination by this Court. Rather, it directed this Court's attention to ""the facts fully found"" (whatever they may have been) and asked whether the defendant had been properly found not guilty of an offence against s 13(2). That was in substance an appeal against the dismissal of the charge brought against the defendant, and no less so because of the introductory words, ""Did I err in law in interpreting s 13(2) of the Act … "". 
     
      
    6 The Court having raised the matter, the defendant objected to the form of the stated case. Neither party was in a position to assist the Court.  
     
      
    7 The defendant provided supplementary written submissions on the point; as Harrison J has recorded, the prosecutor did not. It is correct that the directions for further written submissions were confined to submissions on the application next mentioned to strike out the case stated on the ground that the penalty infringement notice was invalid. In declining, for that reason, to deal further with the form of the stated case, when it could have responded to the defendant's submissions or at least asked the Court whether it should respond, the prosecutor compounded its initial inability to provide assistance to the Court, quite apart from considerations of its own interests.  
     
      
    8 The Court is entitled to have had better attention given by the parties to the presentation of the stated case.  
     
      
    9 No application was made to remit the stated case for amendment or supplementation. Despite its unsatisfactory form, the questions of law submitted by the judge in the stated case should be determined so far as can properly be done within the constraints of this Court's authority. 
     
      
    The application to strike out the stated case on the ground that the penalty infringement notice was invalid 
     
      
    10 The defendant's written submissions provided prior to the hearing showed little recognition that the stated case procedure under s 5B confined this Court's attention to questions of law arising on the appeal to the District Court and submitted by the judge. One respect in which they went beyond the stated case was the contention that the penalty infringement notice was not validly issued, and that that vitiated the prosecution and in an unspecified way it should so be held on the stated case. That question did not arise in the appeal to the District Court, and was not within the questions of law submitted by the judge. It can not be determined on the stated case. 
     
      
    11 In order to provide a possible vehicle for the contention to be addressed, the Court suggested to the defendant's counsel that she might orally apply to strike out the stated case because of the asserted invalidity. She did so. The parties provided supplementary written submissions. Harrison J has summarised their arguments. 
     
      
    12 In my opinion, the application should be dismissed. I express no view on the validity of the issue of the penalty infringement notice or the effect (if any) of invalidity on the prosecution. It is sufficient that the authority of this Court comes from the submission by the judge of questions of law arising on the appeal to the District Court. Whether the penalty infringement notice was invalidly issued, and if so what effect (if any) that had on the prosecution, could have been raised before the Magistrate, or on the appeal to the District Court, and if raised would have been a matter for decision within the prosecution or the appeal. To this point there is an effective prosecution and appeal, and the judge has submitted the questions of law. In my opinion, it is not open to the defendant to raise by an application to strike out the stated case his contention that the penalty infringement notice was not validly issued.  
     
      
    The defendant's application to add a further question of law 
     
      
    13 As described by Harrison J, this application was made in the defendant's supplementary written submissions. It was made without leave. Harrison J has described the arguments. Apart from the absence of leave, the application is without substance.  
     
      
    14 First, this Court can not add a question of law to a stated case; its authority is confined to determination of a question or questions of law submitted by a judge of the District Court. Secondly, such question or questions must arise on the appeal to the District Court, and it is apparent that the validity of the issue of the penalty infringement notice was not raised and so did not arise in the appeal. Thirdly, the question as framed, for the reasons given by Harrison J, was not specific to the present case, and even if it were made specific by regard to the penalty infringement notice issued against the defendant questions of fact could arise which are not the subject of the stated case. Not least, for the prosecutor's argument relying on s 37 of the Fines Act 1996 it would be necessary to know how proceedings were taken against the defendant following an election to have the matter dealt with a court.  
     
      
    15 The application should be dismissed. 
     
      
    The construction of s 13(2)(b) 
     
      
    16 Harrison J has set out s 13 of the Companion Animals Act and the respective arguments.  
     
      
    17 There is a contravention of s 13, for the purposes of s 13(2), in the circumstances set out in s 13(1); that is, where a dog is in a public place not under a competent person's effective control in the required manner. Section 13(2) then provides that if the section is contravened there is guilt of an offence, either guilt of the owner of the dog or guilt of another person who was in charge of the dog at the time. These are alternatives, the second being conditional on an additional fact. The owner is guilty if the owner was present at the time of the offence. The other person may be guilty if the owner was not present at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    18 For the second of the alternatives to operate, it is necessary that the owner was not present ""at the time of the offence"": unhappy wording but meaning at the time the dog was in a public place not under the control of a competent person as stated in s 13(1). It is also necessary that another person was in charge of the dog at the time of the offence. The owner of the dog is guilty of an offence pursuant to s 13(2)(a) unless the dual requirements in s 13(2)(b) are fulfilled, in which event the other person is guilty of an offence pursuant to s 13(2)(b).  
     
      
    19 In the present case the dog was in a public place and was not under the effective control of a competent person in the required manner. The defendant was the owner of the dog, but was not present at the time of the offence. Accordingly, and subject to the defendant's submissions concerning s 12A of the Companion Animals Act next mentioned, whether the defendant was guilty of an offence turned on whether his wife and/or children were in charge of the dog at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    20 Putting the construction issue in accord with the arguments as described by Harrison J, being in charge of the dog at the time of the offence could mean having the general care and control of the dog, or could mean having the particular control of the dog when the dog was in the public place. In my opinion, the latter is the correct construction. The section is concerned with the control of dogs in public places through the exercise of control by the owner of the dog or by some other person who is in charge of the dog. The words ""at the time of the offence"" and ""at that time"" make it clear that being in charge is directed to the effective control of the dog which should be exercised but is not being exercised. Being in charge of a dog means more than responsibility for its general care and control; it means having the particular responsibility for its control when the dog is in the public place. 
     
      
    21 Accordingly, the judge was wrong in law to be satisfied that the defendant's wife and/or children were in charge of the dog because the dog had been left in their care and control.  
     
      
    22 Question 1 in the case stated may not in its terms be entirely appropriate to the construction issue. The question can be treated as asking whether the judge erred in law in finding that a person in whose care and control a dog had been left but who was not present when the dog was in a public place was a person in charge of the dog at the time of the contravention of s 13(1). So understood, the question should be answered yes.  
     
      
    23 As I have said, question 2 in the stated case did not present a question of law for determination. It should not be answered. 
     
      
    24 Harrison J has described the defendant's argument to the effect that s 12A of the Companion Animals Act was engaged, not s 13, and that the two were mutually exclusive. I make no comment upon that argument. The facts in the stated case say nothing about how the dog came to be in the public place. (The judge's judgment says nothing about it. The defendant told the Magistrate that the dog dug his way out under the fence, but no clear finding was made even if regard can be had to the transcript of the proceedings before the Magistrate.) Apart from the absence of necessary facts, the engagement of s 12A does not arise on the stated case because question 1 is concerned only with the construction of s 13(2)(b) and question 2 should not be answered.  
     
      
    Costs 
     
      
    25 The prosecutor's first submission was that the judge had awarded costs to the defendant without necessary prior regard to whether he was satisfied in one or more of the respects set out in s 70(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. The stated case does not refer to satisfaction. Were it permissible to have regard to the transcript before the judge, it would be seen that satisfaction does not appear to have been raised for his Honour's consideration. However, it would also be seen that the judge made observations critical of the prosecutor, which could have brought the matter within s 70(1)(d) if it had been drawn to his attention. It is unnecessary to consider this submission further, since the prosecutor's second submission should be accepted.  
     
      
    26 The second submission was that costs could not be awarded for the defendant's personal time. I am prepared to act on the common ground that the personal time was the defendant's lost earnings as a taxi driver. The prosecutor relied on Cachia v Hanes [1994] HCA 14; (1994) 179 CLR 403. The defendant submitted that Cachia v Hanes could be distinguished because the present case was a criminal case, but could not provide a principled basis for a distinction. He also relied on Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade v Boswell [No 2] (1992) 39 FCR 288 at 295 and its adoption by the minority in Cachia v Hanes at 423, but the observations in that case can not stand with the view of the majority in Cachia v Hanes.  
     
      
    27 The starting-point must be the judge's power to award costs, although neither party referred to it. The appeal to the District Court was under s 11 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. By s 28(3), subject to s 70 the District Court could ""make such order as to the costs to be paid by either party (including the Crown) as it thinks just"". ""Costs"" was not defined. 
     
      
    28 The reasoning of the majority in Cachia v Hanes applies. ""Costs"" means money paid or liabilities incurred for professional legal services, and costs orders are intended to reimburse a party for costs incurred, and ""are not intended to compensate for some other disadvantage or inconvenience suffered by the litigant"" (at 414, per Mason CJ and Brennan, Deane, Dawson and McHugh JJ). Loss of earnings can not be treated as a disbursement (at 417, ibid). 
     
      
    29 Accordingly, question 3 in the stated case should be answered yes. 
     
      
    Other orders 
     
      
    30 The prosecutor submitted that this Court should order that the appeal to the District Court be dismissed (but did not seek an order for costs in the District Court). I do not think that should be done. It may be that application can be made in the appeal to put submissions concerning s 12A, or possibly to raise the contention concerning invalid issue of the penalty infringement notice. The defendant should not be shut out from those opportunities. 
     
      
    31 The defendant rather faintly submitted that no order should be made beyond answering the questions, so that the judge's decision would remain. He referred to Roads and Traffic Authority v Baldock [2007] NSWCCA 35; (2007) 168 A Crim R 566 at [52-[55], but there the prosecutor did not seek an order remitting the matter to the District Court. In the present case the prosecutor sought to overturn the judge's decision, and if that is not done by this Court ordering that the appeal be dismissed there should be a remission. 
     
      
    32 In my opinion, consequent upon the answers to questions 1 and 3 the judge's orders should be set aside, and the matter should be remitted to the District Court where the appeal can be re-addressed. 
     
      
    33 The prosecutor has in substance succeeded on the stated case, and there should not be a partial costs order in favour of the defendant reflecting that question 2 is not answered. The prosecutor did not ask for costs of the stated case. 
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    34 I propose the orders: 
     
      
      1. Dismiss the applications to strike out and to add a question to the stated case. 
       
       
      2. Answer the questions in the stated case as follows: 
       
        
         
        (1) Did I err in law in the construction of s 13(2)(b) in finding that a person not present at the time of the events was "" 
        in charge of the dog at that time 
        ""? 
         
          
         
         
        On the understanding of the question set out in these reasons, yes. 
         
          
         
         
        (2) Did I err in law in interpreting s 13(2) of the Act by finding that the Defendant (owner of the dog), on the facts fully found, was not guilty of an offence against s 13(2). 
         
          
         
         
        Not answered. 
         
          
         
         
        (3) Did I err in law in awarding the Defendant his costs for his personal time (not limited to his reasonable out-of-pocket expenses)? 
         
          
         
         
        Yes. 
        
       
       
      3. Set aside the orders dismissing the charge and awarding costs to the defendant. 
       
       
      4. Remit the matter to the District Court for disposal in accordance with law.  
       
      
    35 BUDDIN J: I agree with Giles JA. 
     
      
    36 HARRISON J: Section 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""5B (1) A Judge of the District Court may submit any question of law arising on any appeal to the District Court in its criminal and special jurisdiction coming before the Judge to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination, and the Court of Criminal Appeal may make any such order or give any such direction to the District Court as it thinks fit.  
         
         
        (2) At the request of a person who was a party to appeal proceedings referred to in subsection (1), a question of law may be submitted under that subsection to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination even though the appeal proceedings during which the question arose have been disposed of. The question of law must be submitted not later than 28 days after the end of the appeal proceedings, or within such longer period as the Court of Criminal Appeal may allow.  
         
         
        (3) The Court of Criminal Appeal may, in connection with the determination of a question of law in the circumstances referred to in subsection (2), quash any acquittal, conviction or sentence of the District Court on the appeal to the District Court.""  
        
       
      
    37 The proceedings in this Court are brought pursuant to that provision by way of stated case from the decision of his Honour Armitage DCJ. The stated case is in the following form: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        The Proceedings 
         
         
        1. The proceedings involve a prosecution of Mr Emidio Pedras as owner of a dog for a breach of s 13(2) of the  
        Companion Animals Act 1998. 
         
         
        2. The Prosecutor issued a Penalty Infringement Notice No. 7660464626 dated 22 August 2007 to the Defendant. 
         
         
        3. The Defendant elected to have the matter heard by the Local Court. That hearing took place before Magistrate Betts at the Ryde Local Court on 24 July 2008. Betts J [ 
        sic 
        ] convicted the Defendant and fined him $200 plus Court costs of $73. 
         
         
        4. The Defendant appealed to the District Court pursuant to the  
        Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 
        . 
         
         
        5. I heard that appeal on 16 October 2008. On that day I heard evidence and submissions from each of the parties. 
         
         
        6. Section 13(1) of the  
        Companion Animals Act 
         requires that a dog that is in a public place must be under the effective control of some competent person by means of an adequate chain, cord or leash that is attached to the dog and that is being held by (or secured to) the person. I was satisfied that the dog the subject of this Stated Case was, on 22 August 2007, in a public place (being Devlin Street, Ryde) and that it was not under the effective control of a competent person. That is, I was satisfied there was a contravention of s 13(1) of the  
        Companion Animals Act 
        . 
         
         
        7. I was also satisfied that the Defendant was the owner of the dog for the purposes of the  
        Companion Animals Act 
        . 
         
         
        8. However, I was satisfied that the owner (the Defendant) was not present at the time of the offence. I was satisfied on the evidence before me that the Defendant was overseas at the time of the offence. Further, I was satisfied that the dog had been left in the care and control of the Defendant's wife and/or children all of whom were over the age of 16. 
         
         
        9. Lastly, I was satisfied that neither the wife, nor any other person in whose care and control the dog had been left by the Defendant, was present at the public place at the time of the offence. 
         
         
        10. I decided that as the wife and/or children had the care and control of the dog on the date of the offence, the wife and/or children was a person "" 
        in charge of the dog 
        "" at the time of the offence for the purposes of s 13(2)(b). As a result, I upheld the Defendant's appeal and dismissed the charge. 
         
         
        11. I awarded the Defendant costs which involved an amount of $200 for his personal time. 
         
         
        Appellant's Contentions 
         
         
        12. The Appellant contends that I have erred in: 
         
         
        (a) my interpretation of section 13(2) of the  
        Companion Animals Act 
        , and 
         
        
       
        
       
        
         
        (b) the award of Costs. 
         
         
        Respondent's Contentions 
         
         
        13.  
        [TO BE COMPLETED] 
         
         
        Stated Questions 
         
         
        14. I submit the following questions for determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal: 
         
         
        1. Did I err in law in the construction of s 13(2)(b) in finding that a person not present at the time of the offence was "" 
        in charge of the dog at that time 
        ""? 
         
         
        2. Did I err in law in interpreting s 13(2) of the Act by finding that the Defendant (owner of the dog), on the facts fully found, was not guilty of an offence against s 13(2)? 
         
         
        3. Did I err in law in awarding the Defendant his costs for his personal time (not limited to his reasonable out of pocket expenses)?  
         
         
        Documents Annexed 
         
         
        15. I annex the following copy documents: 
         
         
          
         
         
        (a) Penalty Infringement Notice; 
        
       
       
        
         
        (b) Transcript from the proceedings in the Local Court; 
        
       
       
        
         
        (c) Notice of Appeal to the District Court; 
        
       
       
        
         
        (d) Transcript before me in the District Court including my judgment."" 
        
       
      
    Preliminary issue – is the stated case bad in form? 
     
      
    38 It became apparent at the commencement of the hearing of the appeal in this Court that the form of the stated case was problematic. In Sasterawan v Morris [2007] NSWCCA 185; (2007) 69 NSWLR 547, Basten JA said this commencing at [10]: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        Form of case stated 
         
         
        [10] The primary basis upon which the prosecutor sought to resist the extension of time was that the case stated had inadequate prospects of success. Before dealing with the substance of the case stated, however, it is necessary to note the constraints under which this Court operates in considering such a statutory appeal. Section 5B provides that a judge of the District Court may submit a ""question of law"" to this Court ""for determination"" and empowers this Court to make appropriate orders or give appropriate directions. What it does not do is authorise this Court to determine any questions of fact or to draw factual inferences. This Court is constrained to act on the facts as stated by the District Court: see  
        Mack v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW)  
        (1920) 28 CLR 373 at 381 (Isaacs J);  
        The Queen v Rigby  
        (1956) 100 CLR 146 at 150-151 (Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Webb, Kitto and Taylor JJ) and  
        Brisbane City Council v Valuer-General (Qld)  
        (1978) 140 CLR 41 at 58 (Gibbs J, Stephen, Mason, Murphy and Aickin JJ agreeing).  
         
         
        [11] That does not mean that facts other than those expressly identified in the case stated may not be gleaned from the form of the case: see  
        The Queen v Rigby 
        , 100 CLR at 151. However, the Court is not obliged (nor should it be expected) to sift through documents to identify ""facts found"" which the applicant has not thought it necessary to include in the case requested to be stated. Nor should any different result eventuate because an application for an extension of time is required and is supported by related material. The form of a stated case has long provided difficulties for would-be appellants, and a fertile field for judicial advice: see  
        Dennis v Watt  
        (1942) 59 WN(NSW) 204 (Jordan CJ)."" 
        
       
      
    39 Having regard only to the form of the stated case, the facts relevantly found by his Honour would appear to be limited to the following: 
     
      
      (a) The defendant was the owner of the dog for the purposes of the  
      Companion Animals Act  
      1998. 
       
       
      (b) The defendant was issued with a penalty infringement notice dated 22 August 2007. 
       
       
      (c) The defendant was fined and convicted by Magistrate Betts on 24 July 2008 for a breach of s 13(2) of the  
      Companion Animals Act 
      . 
       
       
      (d) The defendant appealed to the District Court pursuant to the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
        
      2001 
      . 
       
       
      (e) Armitage DCJ heard the appeal on 16 October 2008 and found that: 
       
       
        
         
        (i) The defendant's dog was in a public place on 22 August 2007 and was at that time and place not under the effective control of a competent person. 
        
       
       
        
         
        (ii) There was in the circumstances referred to in (i) a contravention of s 13(1) of the  
        Companion Animals Act 
        . 
        
       
       
        
         
        (iii) The defendant was not present at the time of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
         
        (iv) The defendant had left the dog in the care and control of his wife and children who were all aged over 16 years of age which care and control they retained on the date of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
         
        (v) The defendant's wife and children were not present at the public place at the time of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
         
        (vi) The defendant's wife was a person and/or his children were persons in charge of the dog at the time of the offence for the purposes of s 13(2)(b) of the  
        Companion Animals Act 
        . 
        
       
       
      (f) The defendant's appeal to the District Court of New South Wales was upheld and his conviction was quashed. 
       
      
    Defendant's submissions on the (preliminary) application to strike out the stated case as bad in form 
     
      
    40 Accordingly, at the hearing of the appeal in this Court the defendant raised a preliminary issue. The defendant contended that the stated case posed questions that were not properly questions of law. He argued that this Court should not be required to answer questions that are not appropriately formulated: see, for example, R v Dittmar [1973] 1 NSWLR 722 at 728; Castlebar Holding v Riley [2005] NSWCCA 105 at par [41] per Grove J. In Madden (1995) 85 A Crim R 367 at 370, Hunt CJ at CL said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The procedure provided by s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) is intended to permit the district court judge to obtain advice from this Court upon questions of law which will assist that judge in determining the fate of the appeal to that Court pursuant to s 122 of the Justices Act;  
        Re Van der Lubbe (1949) 49 SR 309 at 312 
        . The procedure is not intended to provide a means of challenging the ultimate determination made (or to be made) by the judge upon that appeal to the district court, as there is no right of appeal to this Court from that determination. The question asked here is in form no more that an attempt to exercise such a right of appeal. It is for that reason that this Court has said, and often repeated, that it is necessary that the particular question or questions of law upon which advice is to be obtained are specifically stated. See, eg, Re Van der Lubbe (at 312); Law Society v Goodwin [1972] 2 NSWLR 462 at 464 
        "" 
        
       
      
    41 The defendant relied upon the line of authority establishing that this Court ought not to be left ""to grope through the case as stated and try to discover for itself what are the specific questions of law involved"": Re van der Lubbe (1949) 49 SR (NSW) 309 per Jordan CJ at 312. See also Stephenson, Blake & Co v Grant, Legros & Co (1917) 86 LJ Ch 439. The defendant contended that the questions posed were not specific questions of law. 
     
      
    42 The defendant also submitted that it was undesirable that this Court should either be asked to decide or should itself choose to decide to reformulate questions. This has been stated unequivocally in McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Limited v Environment Protection Authority (2000-2001) 50 NSWLR 127; [2000] NSWCCA 367 at [81] per Spigelman CJ where his Honour said, ""[i]t is not desirable for this Court to reformulate the question actually posed so that it answers the description 'question of law'."" This Court has held that ""recitation of a determination by the first instance judge preceded by the interrogatory 'did I err in law' does not create [a question of law]"": Castlebar Holding v Riley (supra) at [13].  
     
      
    43 In Sasterawan v Morris (supra), Basten JA also said this at [15]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[15] In  
        Robinson v Woolworths Ltd  
        [2005] NSWCCA 426, (2005) 64 NSWLR 612, I suggested that there may be some awkwardness in formulating questions in this way: at [7]-[10], Barr J agreeing at [82]. The questions in the present case seek to ask ""Did I err in law"", which does not leave open the possibility of other forms of error, but, at the same time, does not identify any specific question of law for determination by this Court. (This form of question seems not uncommon, but is not therefore appropriate: see  
        Garrett v Freeman  
        [2006] NSWCCA 278 at [43].)"" 
        
       
      
    44 The defendant contended that this Court ought not now reformulate the questions for the prosecutor in some (apparently) proper form. The defendant submitted that the stated case should be struck out. It was described by the defendant as in effect an attempt to appeal against the decision of the District Court. 
     
      
    Prosecutor's submissions on the (preliminary) application to strike out the stated case as bad in form 
     
      
    45 The prosecutor made no written response to the defendant's further written submissions on this point. Instead, the prosecutor drew attention to the fact that at the conclusion of the hearing in this Court directions were made for the filing and service of such submissions in relation to the limited issue of whether the stated case was vulnerable to being struck out on jurisdictional grounds. Briefly stated, that issue was one that asked, if the penalty notice was so defective that the Local Court had no jurisdiction to hear the matter, was there correspondingly then any jurisdiction for an appeal to the District Court or in turn any jurisdiction to state a case to this Court. According to the prosecutor, the defendant's further written submissions, purportedly formulated pursuant to this Court's grant of leave to file them, strayed beyond that issue. In those circumstances the prosecutor did not deal with the defendant's submissions on the point in its own supplementary written submissions in response. 
     
      
    46 However, in the context of these proceedings it is obvious that the prosecutor opposes the defendant's attempt to deal with the proceedings in this way. 
     
      
    Discussion 
     
      
    47 The first two questions are infelicitously drawn. The principal reason for this appears to be because the answers to those questions will not or may not necessarily provide any definitive or meaningful assistance in resolving the competing contentions about how s 13 should be interpreted. The answer to the first question goes only to the issue of whether or not the interpretation apparently adopted by Armitage DCJ was correct. The second question is not a question of law. However, at one important level, this difficulty is less significant than might at first appear. This is because of the flexible regime that is provided by s 5B(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. It is apparent that at least the limited answer contemplated by the first question submitted for determination may be capable of being given a practical content and operation through this Court's ability to quash any acquittal, conviction or sentence of the District Court ""in connection with the determination of a question of law in the circumstances referred to in subsection (2)"".  
     
      
    48 With respect to the first question this Court is not being asked, contrary to authority, to determine any questions of fact or to draw factual inferences. The parties' respective contentions about the interpretation and operation of s 13 would appear to me to be capable of consideration and determination by reference only to the facts as found together with such facts other than those expressly identified in the case stated that may be gleaned from its form. I do not apprehend that the form of the stated case either invites or requires this Court to sift through documents to identify the relevant facts, which the applicant has not thought it necessary to include in the case as stated. 
     
      
    49 This Court ought not too readily reject a case stated for determination by adopting an overly technical approach to the issue if practical effect can be afforded to the parties' intentions in framing the case in the way that they have. Even Hunt CJ at CL in Madden (supra) at 370-371, would appear to have contemplated with approval, although not with encouragement, the attachment of the primary judge's reasons to the stated case for the purpose of enabling this Court to have regard to matters outside the stated case where a party wishes to rely upon express or implicit findings made by the judge. The parties in this case have each approached this appeal upon the basis that the reasoning of Armitage DCJ is critical to an assessment of his Honour's interpretation of the statute and to the identification of the error of law for which the prosecutor contends. 
     
      
    50 Nor is this a case like Madden, where the form of all of the questions posed for determination amounted to an assault upon the ultimate determination made by the trial judge in that case. Here only the second question is in that form. All of the questions submitted for determination in Madden commenced with words ""[i]t was not open in law for the judge to"" find or to draw inferences or to conclude, as the case may be. The Chief Judge concluded, uncontroversially in my respectful opinion, that the questions asked were in a form that was no more than an attempt to exercise a non-existent right of appeal from that determination. By way of contrast, the first question submitted for determination here isolates a question of law for consideration by this Court. There is no dispute about the facts that generate the question.  
     
      
    51 The second question is different. It amounts to an attempt to exercise a non-existent right of appeal from a determination of the District Court. I respectfully adopt the remarks of Giles JA concerning that question. 
     
      
    52 The third question is directed to the legal, not the factual, entitlement to an award of costs other than legal costs and disbursements. That is also a question of law. There is no dispute about the facts that generate that question. 
     
      
    53 I would not in these circumstances strike out the case as stated as one that is bad in form. However, the second question should not be answered. 
     
      
    Defendant's submissions on the application to strike out the stated case as bad for want of jurisdiction 
     
      
    54 The defendant sought to argue that the penalty notice issued on 22 August 2007 pursuant to the Fines Act 1996 was invalid for three reasons. First, it did not specify the offence as required by s 20. In this respect the penalty notice did not refer to the Companion Animals Act at all, nor to s 13 upon which the prosecutor relies. Secondly, the penalty notice describes the offence as ""dog not under effective control"", apparently as a short description of the s 13 offence. The defendant submitted that there was no legislative entitlement to describe an offence in that way and therefore there was no specification as required. Thirdly, the penalty notice should in any event have been issued for an offence under s 12A, rather than s 13(2). In those circumstances the defendant sought to argue that there was no jurisdiction in either the Local Court of New South Wales or the District Court of New South Wales to hear the matter, so that the validity of the stated case fell to be assessed accordingly.  
     
      
    55 The defendant argued that the stated case was hypothetical, rather than a final determination of rights between the parties: see Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10; (1992) 175 CLR 564; Bass v Permanent Trustee Company Ltd [1999] HCA 9; (1999) 198 CLR 334; University of New South Wales v Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26; (1975) 133 CLR 1 at 10 per Gibbs J. The defendant could not have been legitimately convicted on the penalty notice as issued and therefore the stated case cannot lead to any final or binding legal result or consequence for either of the parties. The defendant submitted that the point of principle was that if a conviction could never have stood, presumably in the sense that it could not have survived challenge on appeal, then it would not be possible for there to be a question of law to be answered by this Court on a stated case in such circumstances. 
     
      
    Prosecutor's submissions on the application to strike out the stated case as bad for want of jurisdiction 
     
      
    56 The stated case stems from a contravention of s 13(1) of the Companion Animals Act. The prosecutor alleges that by s 13(2)(a) it is the owner of the dog who is guilty of the offence. Section 92 of that Act provides for the issue of penalty notices in relation to offences prescribed by the Regulations. Section 13(2) is prescribed as a Penalty Notice Offence by cl 34 and Schedule 1 of the Companion Animals Regulation 2008. Other Acts make similar provisions – see, for example, Part 5.3 and s 183 of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005, and cl 169 of the Road Transport (General) Regulation 2005. 
     
      
    57 Once a penalty notice is issued under its cognate legislation, the Fines Act provides for the recovery of those fines. As its long title indicates, it is ""an Act relating to fines and their enforcement and to other matters"". The scope of that Act and its application to penalty notices is described by s 19 which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        19 Summary of penalty notice procedure  
         
         
        (1) The following is a summary of the penalty notice procedure under this Part:  
         
          
           
          (a) A person is alleged to have committed an offence under a statutory provision for which a penalty notice may be issued (see Division 2 and Schedule 1).  
           
           
          (b) A penalty notice is issued under the relevant statutory provision. The notice requires payment of a specified monetary penalty, unless the person alleged to have committed the offence elects to have the matter dealt with by a court (see Division 2 and Schedule 1).  
           
           
          (c) If the penalty is not paid, a penalty reminder notice is issued. The person who is alleged to have committed the offence may elect to have the matter dealt with by a court (see Division 3).  
           
           
          (d) If payment of the specified monetary penalty is not made and the person does not elect to have the matter dealt with by a court, a penalty notice enforcement order may be made against the person (see Division 4). If the person does not pay the amount (including enforcement costs) within 28 days, enforcement action authorised by this Act may be taken in the same way as action may be taken for the enforcement of a fine imposed on a person after a court hearing for the offence (see Part 4).  
           
           
          (e) A penalty notice enforcement order may be withdrawn if an error has been made (see Division 4).  
           
           
          (f) A penalty notice enforcement order may, on application, be annulled by the State Debt Recovery Office or, if the Office refuses the application, by the Local Court. If the order is annulled, the alleged offence is to be heard and determined by the Local Court (see Division 5).  
          
         
         
        (2) This section does not affect the provisions of this Part that it summarises.""  
        
       
      
    58 Pursuant to s 20(2) of the Fines Act, and for the purposes of that Act, a penalty notice is ""a notice issued under any of the statutory provisions set out in Schedule 1"". That schedule relevantly identifies the Companion Animals Act, s 92. For the purposes of s 20(2) therefore, the reference to the ""statutory provision"" is a reference to the penalty notice provision in the Companion Animals Act. 
     
      
    59 Section 20(1) of the Fines Act requires that the penalty notice must not merely be a notice issued under the ""statutory provisions"" but requires specification of the offence. The penalty infringement notice in this case described the offence as ""dog not under effective control"". The prosecutor contended that this was a sufficient description of the offence and that it was unnecessary to specify the relevant section. In this way, when the penalty notice regime is properly considered, the penalty infringement notice was valid. 
     
      
    60 Section 92 of the Companion Animals Act provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""92 Penalty notices  
         
         
        (1) An authorised officer may serve a penalty notice on a person if it appears to the officer that the person has committed an offence against this Act or the regulations, being an offence prescribed by the regulations as a penalty notice offence.  
         
         
        (2) A penalty notice is a notice to the effect that, if the person served does not wish to have the matter determined by a court, the person can pay, within the time and to the person specified in the notice, the amount of penalty prescribed by the regulations for the offence if dealt with under this section.  
         
         
        (3) A penalty notice may be served personally or by post.  
         
         
        (4) If the amount of penalty prescribed for an alleged offence is paid under this section, no person is liable to any further proceedings for the alleged offence.  
         
         
        (5) Payment under this section is not to be regarded as an admission of liability for the purpose of, and does not in any way affect or prejudice, any civil claim, action or proceeding arising out of the same occurrence.  
         
         
        (6) The regulations may:  
         
          
           
          (a) prescribe an offence for the purposes of this section by offence, and  
           
           
          (b) prescribe the amount of penalty payable for the offence if dealt with under this section, and  
           
           
          (c) prescribe different amounts of penalties for different offences or classes of offences.  
          
         
         
        (7) The amount of a penalty prescribed under this section for an offence is not to exceed the maximum amount of penalty that could be imposed for the offence by a court.  
         
         
        (8) This section does not limit the operation of any other provision of, or made under, this or any other Act relating to proceedings that may be taken in respect of offences.""  
        
       
      
    61 Section 23A of the Fines Act reflects these provisions: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        23A Person may elect to have matter dealt with by court

          (a) has the right to elect to have the matter dealt with by a court instead of under the statutory provision providing for the issue of the penalty notice, and  
           
           
          (b) may make that election:

    62 The defendant made an election in the present case. Having done so, s 37 of the Fines Act applied. That section provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        37 Matter to proceed  
         
         
        If a person duly elects to have the matter dealt with by a court, proceedings against the person in respect of the offence may be taken as if a penalty notice or penalty reminder notice had not been issued."" 
        
       
      
    63 In Creak v Hornsby Shire Council [2007] NSWLEC 480, Talbot J said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[7] Pursuant to s 37 of the Fines Act 1996, if a person duly elects to have the matter dealt with by a court, proceedings against the person in respect of the offence may be taken as if a penalty notice or penalty reminder notice had not been issued. Accordingly the only charge before the Magistrate was the charge set out in the Court Attendance Notice, namely an offence under s 125(1) of the EPA Act as a consequence of a contravention of s 76A(1)(b). In its trite law that the Local Court has no jurisdiction to convict a person for a statutory offence with which the person has not been charged ( 
        Ex parte Lovell; Re Buckley 
         (1938) 3 SR (NSW) 153). The defect being a lack of jurisdiction is beyond recall and cannot be cured by the application of s 16(1) and s 16(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act."" 
        
       
      
    64 The prosecutor submitted that in the circumstances of the present case the penalty infringement notice was not defective. It was issued pursuant to s 92 of the Companion Animals Act. If it were required to comply with s 20 of the Fines Act it did so even if it only specified the offence and not the relevant provision creating the offence. In any event, the defendant's election overtook these questions and precluded him from raising them thereafter as the result of the operation of s 37 of the Fines Act. In these circumstances the stated case should not be struck out. 
     
      
    Discussion 
     
      
    65 The defendant did not cite authority for the proposition that there was no jurisdiction to state a case to this Court in circumstances where the relevant conviction in a lower court was arguably bad. As a matter of principle it seems to me that it would be an extraordinary result if this Court were to be required, in the context of an application pursuant to s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act, to determine what amounts to a preliminary issue that one of the protagonists contends has arisen but in circumstances that are somehow outside or beyond the questions stated in the case for consideration. The defendant's own approach to these present proceedings appears to anticipate as much in that he has sought to add what is described as a further question of law for consideration as part of the case as stated. This is referred to and dealt with elsewhere in these reasons.  
     
      
    66 The nature and extent of the scope for this Court to review (to use a neutral term) what transpired in the District Court is patently circumscribed by the terms of s 5B(1) of that Act. The wording of that sub-section is wide enough to encompass the framing of a question of law that was limited in substance to an issue touching the validity of the penalty infringement notice, as in this case. There is not in my opinion any facility beyond the framework of the statement of a case on a question or questions of law that would provide any basis for the defendant's challenge to the jurisdictional validity of the present proceedings on what amounts to an apparently preliminary or threshold basis. Indeed, the very jurisdiction of this Court may be enlivened by a question stated for determination that challenges or calls up for consideration the interpretation or statement of the legal requirements for a valid penalty infringement notice, provided only that it gives rise to a question of law to be submitted to this Court for determination as required by the section. If the parties were not able to draw an appropriately formulated question of law that Armitage DCJ was prepared to submit for determination by this Court, the defendant should not otherwise be able to circumvent the stated case procedure in the way he now seeks to do. 
     
      
    67 Although I have set out the parties' competing contentions on the substantive point of the validity of the penalty infringement notice, and its so called relationship with this Court's jurisdiction to hear the matter, and even notwithstanding that it gives rise to certain questions of potential interest and significance, there is in my opinion no facility for this Court to address the point in the nominated context of the defendant's present application. If these issues are capable of consideration in these proceedings at all, they are only capable of consideration in the event that the defendant's application to add a further question of law to the stated case is successful. This is considered below. 
     
      
    Defendant's application to add a further question of law 
     
      
    68 Against the contingency that his applications to strike out the stated case on either basis were unsuccessful, the defendant sought to argue that it should instead in those circumstances include ""the following question of law"": 
     
      
       
        
        ""What are the criteria for validity of a penalty infringement notice issued for offences under the  
        Companion Animals Act  
        1998 
        ?"" 
        
       
      
    69 The defendant submitted that this Court should add this question to those already contained in the stated case for the following reasons. This Court has power to make such an addition pursuant to the general power provided in s 5B(1) that allows the Court to consider any ""question of law arising"": The Australian Commonwealth Shipping Board v The Federated Seamen's Union of Australia [1925] HCA 3; (1925) 35 CLR 462. The defendant submitted that the validity of the penalty infringement notice satisfied that requirement as a question of law arising because: 
     
      
      (a) there is no factual dispute about the notice that issued so that no new facts need to be found; 
       
       
      (b) a precondition to the application of s 13 of the  
      Companion Animals Act 
       is that the notice must be valid and enforceable. Only if the notice is valid can a recipient be in a position to make an election as to whether he or she wanted to contest the offence alleged and the Court would only be able to determine the application of s 13 if the penalty infringement notice issued under the section is valid; 
       
       
      (c) the question was not ever made the subject of any consultation with the defendant and would or may have been included in the stated case if that had occurred. This has caused prejudice to the defendant over which he was given no control; 
       
       
      (d) the prosecutor suffers no corresponding prejudice if the question is included. 
       
      
    70 It can reasonably be anticipated that the defendant's submissions on the jurisdictional point can be transposed as his submissions on whether or not to permit him to raise a further question of law for determination and in turn upon the further question of law if allowed. 
     
      
    Prosecutor's response to defendant's application to add a further question of law 
     
      
    71 The prosecutor did not seek to make separate submissions upon the question of whether or not this further so called question of law could or should be added to or included as part of the case as originally submitted by Armitage DCJ to this Court for determination. However, I have taken it to be the prosecutor's position that its submissions upon the jurisdictional point can also be transposed as its submissions on whether or not to permit the defendant to raise a further question of law for determination and in turn upon the further question of law if allowed. 
     
      
    Discussion 
     
      
    72 In my opinion the defendant ought not be permitted to add a further (so called) question of law for determination. There are at least two reasons for this. First, the question as framed offends the very principles upon which the defendant sought to rely in his own challenge to the form of the stated case. Even allowing for the fact that the question ought reasonably be confined to a consideration of notices issued with respect to s 13 offences alone, rather than notices issued for offences generally, the question raises matters of fact that are not necessarily apparent from the facts as found or that are available as a matter of necessary implication from the facts as found. The question does not ask, and cannot be assumed to be limited to a question that asks, what are the formal requirements of a valid penalty infringement notice. The question does not foreclose upon the possibility that there are or may be several available formats for a valid penalty infringement notice. The question is not limited to the particular form of the notice in this case. It is not to the point that there is no factual dispute about the notice that issued. It is not necessarily correct to say that new facts do not need to be found when the proposed question is in its present form. I am in doubt that the question is in any event a question of law. 
     
      
    73 Secondly, the question did not arise ""on an appeal to the District Court"". The effect of s 37 of the Fines Act is in my opinion such that the defendant's election to have the matter dealt with by the Local Court precludes him from raising the validity of the notice as a question of law for determination by this Court. It does not do so in a purely procedural way binding him as the result of his conduct in electing not to challenge the validity of the notice so that he is in effect estopped or prevented from doing so later. It precludes him from doing so because of what happened in the Local Court. The proceedings there were simply not related to or in any way dependent upon the form of the penalty infringement notice. The form or content or validity of the notice were not elements that made up any part of the proceedings or the issues called up for consideration or determination by the learned Magistrate. The defendant's appearance in response to the notice as a matter of practical reality is beyond dispute but was and now remains a matter of no consequence once the matter commenced to be heard and was dealt with by the Local Court. As the section makes clear, from that point on it was as if the notice had not been issued. There is therefore no scope for contending in the present circumstances that the form or validity of the notice issued to the defendant was or became (or indeed could have become) a ""question of law arising on any appeal to the District Court in its criminal and special jurisdiction coming before the Judge"" as contemplated by s 5B(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. No appeal to the District Court would have been available on an issue that was not an issue in the proceedings in the Local Court and it cannot now be made the subject of a question for submission to this Court for determination pursuant to that section. 
     
      
    Consideration of the prosecutor's argument on the case as originally stated 
     
      
    74 Section 13 of the Companion Animals Act provides relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        13 Responsibilities while dog in public place 
          
         
         
        (1) A dog that is in a public place must be under the effective control of some competent person by means of an adequate chain, cord or leash that is attached to the dog and that is being held by (or secured to) the person.  
         
         
        (2) If this section is contravened:  
         
          
         
         
          
           
          (a) the owner of the dog, or  
           
           
          (b) if the owner is not present at the time of the offence and another person who is of or above the age of 16 years is in charge of the dog at that time-that other person,  
           
          
         
        is guilty of an offence. 
         
         
        (3) Any person (including an authorised officer) can seize a dog that is in a public place in contravention of this section. If the owner of the dog is present, the dog cannot be seized except by an authorised officer and only then if the contravention continues after the owner has been told of the contravention. A reference in this subsection to the owner of the dog includes a reference to the person who is for the time being in charge of the dog.""  
        
       
      
    75 Section 13(2)(b) has two requirements. First, that the owner is not present. In this case the defendant, who was the owner of the dog, was absent overseas. Secondly, there must be a person, not being the owner, of or over the age of 16 years and that person must be ""in charge of the dog at that time"". In this case the defendant's wife is said to be that person. 
     
      
    76 According to the prosecutor, an issue of construction arises for consideration, which can be framed as follows: what does it mean to be ""in charge of the dog at that time"" for the purposes of s 13(2)(b)? The prosecutor argued that to be relevantly ""in charge"" of a dog connotes something different to being in ""effective control"". The latter expression is used in s 13(1). The prosecutor contended that this means that a person may be in charge of a dog at any particular time even though the dog is not under effective control. 
     
      
    77 The prosecutor argued that the expression ""in charge"" could have at least two meanings. It can mean in the care of, as Armitage DCJ appears to have found. Under that interpretation, the dog had been left in the care of the defendant's wife, even though she was not present at the time of the offence. Alternatively, it can mean under the command and/or supervision of a person. It is this interpretation that the prosecutor says is the correct one. 
     
      
    78 The approach taken by Armitage DCJ appears from the terms of a discussion in the transcript between his Honour and the solicitor for the prosecutor in the Court below. After posing the question ""who on the evidence was in charge of the dog"", his Honour answered the question by saying ""he left the dog in the charge of those persons when he went overseas"". The prosecutor contends that the posing of the question in those terms itself bespeaks the error that his Honour made. The question is not in whose charge the dog had been left, as per ""in the charge of"" or ""in the care of""; the question is rather who was ""in charge of the dog"". The prosecutor emphasised that the difference is made clear by the fact that the question of who was in charge of the dog is required to be considered at a particular point in time, being ""at that time"". 
     
      
    79 The first task of statutory interpretation is simply to read the words: see, for example, Walker Corporation Pty Ltd v Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority [2008] HCA 5; (2008) 233 CLR 259. The prosecutor emphasised that it must involve an interpretation of all of the words. In the present context that means that s 13(2)(b), which focuses attention on the effective control of a dog in a public place, imposes a liability upon either the owner of the dog or the person in charge of the dog at that time. The prosecutor contended that the contextual importance of this is that it focuses attention upon the second of the meanings (under the command and/or supervision) rather than the first (in the care of). 
     
      
    80 Section 13(3) expands the defined meaning of ""owner"" for the purposes of the sub-section only. It also focuses upon a person who is, for the ""time being"", in charge of the dog. The reference to the ""time being"" is to the same time as that at which the owner is not present, and at which there is another appropriate person in charge. 
     
      
    81 The prosecutor also contended that the scope and purpose of the Act were relevant matters for consideration. It is said to be apparent from a number of provisions in the Act that its purpose was to impose obligations of control upon an owner. Those obligations of control carry with them liability for failure to comply: see, for example s 12 (a dog must wear a collar), s 12A (responsibility for an escaping dog), s 21 (a dog must not be a nuisance), s 25 (liability for injury to person or damage to property) and s 27 (liability for injury to animals). In all such cases the owner is potentially liable. 
     
      
    82 The prosecutor also draws attention to the long title to the Act: ""an Act to provide for the identification and registration of companion animals and for the duties and responsibilities of their owners; and for other purposes"". This terminology serves to emphasise the overriding obligations on dog owners and evinces a legislative intention to impose liability upon those dog owners who fail to comply. 
     
      
    83 That liability can be avoided for some of the offences in limited circumstances. In the particular circumstances of s 13 it can be avoided if at the time of the relevant event the owner is not present and at that time another person is in charge of the dog. It is consistent with the imposition of liability upon the owner (even in the absence of some fault on the part of the owner) to excuse the owner only if another person was actually present at the time, relevantly in charge and not in effective control. 
     
      
    84 The prosecutor also sought to draw attention to the potential consequences of a dog not being under effective control in a public place with the owner not being present and the person in charge being a person under the age of 16 years. On the approach taken by Armitage DCJ, that set of circumstances would mean that no person bore responsibility for the dog not being under effective control in a public place. The prosecutor submitted that this approach to interpretation would be inconsistent with the scope, object and purpose of the Act. 
     
      
    85 In this context as well the prosecutor pointed to the consequences of an alternative interpretation. The prosecutor's preferred interpretation requires that, if there is no person present in command of and/or supervising the dog at the time of the offence, then the owner is issued with a penalty infringement notice. The prosecutor submitted that such an approach to interpretation is one that assists in the enforcement of s 13 and other similar provisions of the Act. 
     
      
    86 The prosecutor observes that the decision of Armitage DCJ ultimately turned upon his interpretation of the words ""not present at the time of the offence"" in s 13(2)(b). His Honour held that those words ""do not mean not present at the location where the dog was not under effective control"" but ""mean not present in the general area of the property where the dog was being kept"". The prosecutor contended that such an interpretation was erroneous and that such an interpretation and application of s 13 amounted to an error of law: see Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16; (1980) 144 CLR 1 and Vetter v Lake Macquarie City Council [2001] HCA 12; (2002) 202 CLR 439 at [24] – [27]. 
     
      
    87 Finally the prosecutor submitted that s 13 created an offence of strict liability. Applying the three tests formulated by Gibbs CJ in He Kaw Teh v The Queen [1985] HCA 43; (1985) 157 CLR 523, regard must first be had to the words of the statute creating the offence: although the words themselves in s 13 do not contain a clear indication as to whether the presumption of mens rea has been displaced, the prosecutor notes that other offence provisions in the Act do include a requirement for knowledge: see, for example, ss 11(4), 52(2)(b) and 71(4).88 Secondly, the subject matter with which the Act is concerned: it is apparent from the long title to the Act that it was the intention of Parliament to control companion animals and to impose obligations of control upon their owners. Section 13 deals with an activity which, in the public interest, is prohibited with penalty: see Director-General of the Department of Land and Water Conservation v Greentree [2002] NSWLEC 102 at [88] and Director-General of Department of Land and Water Conservation v Greentree [2003] NSWCCA 31; (2003) 131 LGERA 234 commencing at [67]. The section deals with acts that ""are not criminal in any real sense, but are acts which in the public interest are prohibited under a penalty"": He Kaw Teh v The Queen (supra) at 530 referring to Sherras v De Rutzen [1895] 1 QB 918 at 922. 
     
      
    89 Thirdly, whether putting the defendant under strict liability will assist in the enforcement of the particular statutory provision. 
     
      
    90 The prosecutor submitted that in the circumstances it is entirely consistent with the scope, object and purpose of the Act to impose strict liability upon the owner of a companion animal if it is in a public place, not under effective control, where there is no person of or above the age of 16 in charge of the animal at the time. 
     
      
    91 Section 70 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act imposes a limit on costs that may be awarded against a public prosecutor. That section provides relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        70 Limit on costs awarded against public prosecutor 
          
         
         
        (1) Costs are not to be awarded in favour of an appellant whose conviction is set aside unless the appeal court is satisfied:  
         
          
           
          (a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner, or  
           
           
          (b) that the proceedings in the Local Court were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith, or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner, or  
           
           
          (c) that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter:  
           
            
             
            (i) that the prosecutor was or ought reasonably to have been aware of, and  
             
             
            (ii) that suggested that the appellant might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought, or  
            
           
          
         
         
        (d) that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award costs in favour of the appellant.""  
        
       
      
    92 The prosecutor contended that Armitage DCJ gave no consideration to that section. He awarded $200 to the defendant, who was unrepresented, ""for his personal time"". It is accepted that this related to loss of income as a taxi driver as opposed to reasonable out of pocket expenses: see Cachia v Hanes [1994] HCA 14; (1994) 179 CLR 403. 
     
      
    93 The prosecutor contended that his Honour erred in law in so doing. 
     
      
    Consideration of the defendant's argument on the case as originally stated 
     
      
    94 The defendant's submissions were as follows. Regard must be had to the object and purpose of the Act, which was to ensure the ""effective and responsible care and management of companion animals"": s 3A. Consistently with that purpose, the Act imposes unambiguously different requirements and liabilities upon ""owners"" depending upon the context in which the dog is encountered and the ""danger"" or nuisance to the public created. For example, dangerous dogs are treated differently to others. 
     
      
    95 The defendant argued that s 13 does not apply where a dog has escaped from private premises because s 12A covered the field in such cases. The Act creates separate responsibilities where the dog is kept at private premises (s 12A) and where it is taken or accompanied to a public place (s 13). In this legislative context the defendant argued that s 13 only applied where a person has decided to take a dog to a public place. The liability under that section depends upon a failure to ""effectively control"" the dog in the public place by keeping hold upon the dog's leash or by some equivalent means. Therefore, the defendant was not in the circumstances of this case liable for an infringement of s 13. 
     
      
    96 Because the Act provides that certain behaviour renders an owner of a dog (or some other relevant person) liable for an offence, the language that is used for this purpose must clearly state the intention of Parliament before such a conclusion will be reached. As Stephen J said in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Smorgon (1977) 16 ALR 721 at 729, ""a construction of a statute which interferes with the legal rights of the subject to a lesser extent and produces the less hardship is to be preferred to another, having the opposite effect"". The Act must be considered as a whole. Statutory interpretation requires the Court to have regard to the context of the legislation in the first instance and not merely after some kind of ambiguity is established: CIC Insurance Limited v Bankstown Football Club Limited [1997] HCA 2; (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408; Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [69]. 
     
      
    97 The defendant contended that s 12A is engaged when a dog ""escapes"" from a particular property and that it covered the field in that context. Section 13 is directed towards the conduct of a person in a public place. It was submitted that the language of the Act made that clear because for a person to be liable for a breach of s 13 the person must have taken the dog to a public place. The issue is whether the ""control"" being exercised in the public place is effective. The respective penalties for breaches of s 12A and s 13 indicate varying degrees of culpability. 
     
      
    98 It was also the defendant's submission that s 13 requires a person to have chosen to take a dog to a public place. If that has not occurred then the section does not apply. Section 13(1) also requires the person to be holding the dog's leash in the public place. This is said to emphasise the notion that the section envisages a person being present in a public place and either holding the leash or not holding the leash. 
     
      
    99 Section 13(2)(b) provides ""if the owner is not present"". The defendant argued that the owner can only be liable if present and that a liability under s 13(2)(a) only arises if the owner is present. For any other person to be liable they must also be present. If no person, being either the owner of the dog or another person in charge of the dog, is present in a public place then s 13 does not operate. 
     
      
    100 Section 13 was amended by the Companion Animals Amendment Act 2001 to add s 13(2)(b) so that a person other than the owner could be liable. When introducing the amending bill, the then Minister for Local Government, Regional Development and Rural Affairs said the following: New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 10 April 2001 at 13488: 
     
      
       
        
        ""At the moment under the Act it is a defence for an animal owner to say that someone else, such as a professional dog walker or boarding kennel, was in charge of the animal at the time that an offence occurred. However, there is no corresponding offence provision for that person. The bill provides that the person in charge of the animal may, for certain minor offences only, be guilty of the offence in lieu of the owner. This situation will only occur when the owner is not present, and has left the dog or cat in the charge of another person who is aged 16 or older. These offences include 'dog not under effective control in a public place' …"" 
        
       
      
    101 The Minister indicated that the owner was not liable if someone else was responsible for the dog. The amendments to the Act created a liability for the person who was responsible for the dog at the time of the offence. The defendant argued that the example of the dog walker was a good indication that the section envisaged that someone would be present with the dog when the dog was off the leash in circumstances constituting a breach of s 13. 
     
      
    102 Section 13 requires not only control but also effective control. Effective control is explained by the section to be ""an adequate chain, cord or leash that is attached to the dog and that is being held by (or secured to) the person"". This is to be contrasted with some other form of control such as voice commands. This interpretation is said to draw support from s 13(4), which provides that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A dog is not considered to be under the effective control of a person if the person has more than four dogs under his or her control"". 
        
       
      
    The clear meaning is said in such a case to be that if a person is walking more than four dogs he or she will not be able effectively to control them all. The subsection does not envisage four dogs escaping from premises on their own in a way that would render the owner liable under this section. A person must have taken the dogs to a public place for the section to operate. 
     
      
    103 It was at the heart of the defendant's contentions that s 12A and s 13 had different work to do and applied in different situations. Compare Pearce v Cocchiaro [1977] HCA 31; (1977) 137 CLR 600 at 607 where Gibbs J indicated that it could not be supposed that Parliament would have intended a section of the bankruptcy legislation to be a futility. In the present case, different responsibilities attach, depending upon whether a person keeps a dog at home or takes it to a public place. The defendant submitted that the Act should not be interpreted to impose a liability for a dog's behaviour that cannot be ""controlled"" by the owner. An owner has the choice of either controlling the dog by taking special precautions securely to house it on private property (s 12A) or controlling it in a public place in the manner specified (s 13). 
     
      
    104 The defendant argued that the Act ought not to be interpreted in a way that rendered individuals liable for offences merely because their dogs escaped into a public place. Section 12A provides that ""reasonable precautions"" must be taken to ensure that this does not occur. The prosecutor's argument would mean that in the case of an escaped dog being in a public place an owner is potentially liable under s 12A if no reasonable precautions have been taken to prevent escape and under s 13 irrespective of whether or not such precautions were taken. 
     
      
    105 In Regional Director of Education v International Grammar School Sydney Ltd (1986) 7 NSWLR 302 at 314 Kirby P said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is permissible, in statutory construction, to consider the consequences of alternative suggested interpretations of the statute, and the inconvenient consequences which follow if one construction were to be preferred to another, it being presumed that Parliament's purpose is that legislation will operate conveniently and sensibly"". 
        
       
      
    106 The defendant argued that the prosecutor's proposed interpretation of s 13 would potentially render liable responsible owners whose dogs escape, even if they had taken reasonable precautions to enclose the dog so as to prevent it. This would be neither convenient nor sensible and runs counter to the stated purpose of the Act in s 3A and the defence available to an owner under s 12A. 
     
      
    107 Moreover, the defendant contended that the applicable penalties cast light on this issue. The maximum penalty for s 13 offences (10 penalty units) is greater than the corresponding penalty for s 12A offences (8 penalty units). This suggests that the legislature intended to attach a greater responsibility to a person taking a dog for a walk than for keeping the same dog at home. In other words, a failure to take reasonable precautions to prevent a dog from escaping is not considered to be as serious as failing effectively to control a dog in a public place. 
     
      
    108 As an alternative argument the defendant contended that ""in charge of"" should be read as meaning or equating to ""responsible for"". Section 13(2)(b) would then require the owner not to be present and another person to be in charge of the dog before it applied. If, contrary to the defendant's principal submission, s 13 did apply to a case where the dog escaped from a private residence, then the defendant accepts as correct the prosecutor's interpretation that ""in charge of"" means ""in the care of"".  
     
      
    109 According to the defendant, the prosecutor has promoted an interpretation of the section that means that as no person was with the defendant's dog at the relevant time, the default position should be that he as the owner is liable for the dog being in a public place off a leash. According to the defendant's submission, this means that the prosecutor is in fact seeking to read the section in a different way for different purposes: the owner can be liable without being present, but another person cannot, even if the owner has left the dog with that other person. 
     
      
    110 The defendant urges that the legislation should be read as imposing criminal liability on the person who had the ability to prevent the acts being penalised. If the owner has entrusted possession of and responsibility for the dog to another adult, then that owner should not be liable when the legislation can be interpreted as imposing liability upon another person who had the opportunity of preventing the breach. This approach also accords with the sentiment expressed in the Second Reading Speech referred to earlier. 
     
      
    111 Upon the construction for which the defendant contends, an owner will not be liable under s 13 if he or she: 
     
      
      (a) has taken adequate precautions to ensure that the dog does not escape; 
       
       
      (b) has transferred possession of the dog to a responsible adult; and 
       
       
      (c) is absent at the time the dog escapes into the public place. 
       
      
    112 If anyone is to become liable for a contravention of s 13 in such circumstances it ought to be the responsible adult in whose care the dog has been left. ""In charge of"" ought to mean that the person responsible for the dog, in the sense of having legal possession, if not immediate physical control and custody of it, is the person liable under s 13. 
     
      
    113 On the issue of costs the defendant sought to distinguish Cachia v Hanes (supra) upon the basis that it was a civil case and that the present case is concerned with a criminal offence. The burden of that decision was that a rule that provided that costs should be at the discretion of the court applied to costs that were confined to money paid or liabilities incurred for professional legal services and did not include compensation for time spent by a litigant who was not a lawyer in preparing and conducting his case. 
     
      
    114 The defendant referred to Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade v Boswell [No 2] (1992) 39 FCR 288 at 292 in which ""an appropriate indemnity against loss of earnings incurred whether in the preparation of a case or in actual attendance at court"" was considered to be appropriate. 
     
      
    Discussion 
     
      
    115 It is permissible and convenient to have regard to the reasons of the learned judge in order to provide a context to the questions that are submitted for determination. His Honour dealt with the matter in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is apparent from the evidence before me that on 22 August 2007 the appellant's dog, a Jack Russell, was not under the effective control of any person. It is equally apparent that the appellant as at that date was not in Australia. He had gone to South Africa on 17 or 18 August because his brother was very ill; his brother in fact died on 24 August 2007 and the appellant did not return to Australia until early October 2007. 
         
         
         
         ***** 
         
         
        In my opinion the words ""not present at the time of the offence"" do not mean not present at the location where the dog was not under effective control. Those words mean not present in the general area of the property where the dog was being kept. Clearly enough this appellant was not present in that sense as he was in South Africa. 
         
         
        Further, it is my opinion that if, as the appellant said in evidence, his wife son and daughter were in charge of the dog in his absence it is they who would have been guilty of an offence if the dog was in a public place not under effective control. Even if I am wrong in my interpretation of the section it seems to me to be grossly unfair of the council to pursue this matter when it must have known, and in fact did know, that the appellant was out of the country, or at least was claiming to be out of the country, at the relevant time."" 
        
       
      
    116 In my opinion his Honour erred in the construction of s 13(2)(b) in finding that a person not present at the time of the offence was ""in charge of the dog at that time"". In my opinion it is tolerably clear that s 13 contemplates that the dog in question will be accompanied by ""some competent person"" before the offence can be committed. The section is directed to regulating the behaviour of dogs in a public place by reference to the responsibilities of the person who is with the dog at the time. The competent person may be the owner or it may be some person who is in the position of the owner at that time. The offence contemplated by the section is the failure by the person then present, either the owner or some competent person, to keep the dog under effective control. This follows from the words ""if the owner [of the dog] is not present at the time of the offence and"" etc. Either the owner is present or some other person in charge of the dog at that time is present. The notion of some person who is not then present keeping the dog under effective control ""by means of an adequate chain, cord or leash that is attached to the dog and that is being held by (or secured to) the person"" is simply meaningless if any other approach is taken. The short description of the section as dealing with ""responsibilities while dog in public place"" is accurately reflective of the terms of the section. It is directed to the imposition of responsibility upon those who accompany a dog while in a public place, not to responsibility for a dog that happens to be in a public place unaccompanied. The words ""in charge of the dog at that time"" are intended to convey the meaning that some person other than the owner may be liable for failing to keep the dog under effective control if that responsibility cannot be ascribed to or directed at the owner if the owner is not present. The section imposes a liability for behaviour while a person is or should be keeping a dog under effective control. It is that behaviour at that time and in that place that is the subject of the sanction.117 I am also attracted to the proposition that if the prosecutor's arguments were accepted, s 12A would either have no work to do or the defence for which it provides would be capable of circumvention. Section 12A provides that the owner of a dog must take all reasonable precautions to prevent it from escaping from the property on which it is being kept. In circumstances where a dog escaped from premises despite reasonable precautions having been taken by the owner to prevent it, the owner would, on the prosecutor's analysis, still be potentially liable under s 13, even if not present at the time.  
     
      
    118 It cannot in my opinion have been the intention of the legislature to create or to impose a liability upon an owner under s 13, whose dog is found to be unaccompanied in a public place, if that owner would have been able to demonstrate that the dog had not been taken to the public place and that reasonable precautions had been taken to prevent the dog's escape so as to amount to a defence to an alleged contravention of s 12A. The sections are directed to different situations. If it were otherwise a defendant could be exposed to prosecution for the same activity rendering him or her potentially liable to conviction for an offence that was defensible in one case but indefensible in the other and where the availability of the defence would in effect be at the whim of the complainant. In such circumstances the same set of facts could lead to conflicting and contradictory results. This conflict cannot be reconciled unless s 13 is interpreted to apply only in those cases where the owner or the person in charge has taken the dog in question to the public place and is not exercising effective control in one or other of the prescribed ways. 
     
      
    119 It is no answer to this conclusion to contend that it may produce a result in some circumstances that no person may be liable for a dog being in a public place that is not under the effective control of some competent person if neither the owner nor some other competent person is present. In my opinion, that is the natural result of the words of a section that is directed to the enforced modification of behaviour of the person present at the time when the dog is in the public place and under whose effective control the dog should then be. 
     
      
    120 The second question that is asked is not a question of law and should not be answered. 
     
      
    121 The issue of whether or not the section imposes a strict liability is beside the point and does not arise for consideration. It may be that s 13 is an offence of strict liability so that proof of mens rea is not required. However, for present purposes the inquiry is directed toward discerning who may be liable for a contravention of s 13, not what may be the mental elements of the offence. The very terms of the section contemplate the imposition of liability upon someone other than the owner of the dog in certain circumstances. The real question includes an issue of whether or not there is a default provision in the section rendering the owner liable if no other candidate is available. That has nothing to do with strict liability per se. No issue of whether the section does or does not impose strict liability on the owner of a dog arises for consideration in answer to the questions submitted for determination. 
     
      
    122 Finally, on the question of costs, the majority in Cachia v Hanes (supra) at [24] said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[24] We should add that the English legislation and rule represent a straightforward approach to the problem, in contrast to the approach adopted in some cases where courts have treated the loss in earnings of a litigant incurred in the course of the presentation or conduct of his case as a disbursement ((19) See Kerridge v. Foley, unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales in Equity, 19 August 1970; Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade v. Boswell [1992] FCA 629; (1992) 111 ALR 553; cf. Petrunic v. Barnes (1989) VR 927; Australian Blue Metal v. Hughes (1970) 2 NSWR 119.). Clearly, that is merely an indirect way of recompensing a litigant for time spent in the preparation or conduct of his case which, if it is not contemplated by the relevant legislation or rules, is not permissible. Of course, a litigant who qualifies as a witness is entitled to the ordinary witness's fees."" 
        
       
      
    123 I would not accept that anything said in that case was confined to civil cases or that it did not apply to the present case. No authority is cited for such a proposition. If the principle applies to the present case then the award of costs to the defendant as compensation for his time or lost income was erroneous. 
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    124 Accordingly, I would answer the questions as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Did I err in law in the construction of s 13(2)(b) in finding that a person not present at the time of the offence was "" 
      in charge of the dog at that time 
      ""? 
       
       
         
        
       
       
      Yes. 
       
       
      2. Did I err in law in interpreting s 13(2) of the Act by finding that the Defendant (owner of the dog), on the facts fully found, was not guilty of an offence against s 13(2)? 
       
       
         
        
       
       
      Not answered. 
       
       
      3. Did I err in law in awarding the Defendant his costs for his personal time (not limited to his reasonable out of pocket expenses)?  
       
       
       Yes. 
       
      
    125 It will be apparent that I have come to a view about the construction of s 13 that differs from the view of Giles JA and Buddin J. However, in terms of the disposition of the proceedings in this Court, I agree with the orders that Giles JA proposes.

      JUDGMENT No. 18 (Remarks on Sentence) 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: The Offenders, Thomas Sam and Manju Sam, stand for sentence following conviction of each of them by a jury on 5 June 2009 of the crime of manslaughter of their infant daughter, Gloria.  
     
      
    2 Gloria Mary Thomas was born in Sydney on 18 July 2001. Until October 2001, Gloria progressed as a healthy and growing child. In November 2001, she was diagnosed with eczema. On 8 May 2002, Gloria died at the age of nine months. By their verdicts, the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Gloria died as a result of the criminal negligence of both Offenders. 
     
      
       
      The Crime of Manslaughter by Criminal Negligence  
       
      
    3 In approaching the imposition of sentence, it is necessary to have regard to the nature of the crime of which each Offender was convicted by the jury. 
     
      
    4 The elements of the crime of manslaughter by criminal negligence were set out in my written directions to the jury: R v Sam (No. 17) [2009] NSWSC 803. The offence involves application of an objective test, based on the standard of a reasonable hypothetical person: R v Sam (No. 17) at [9].  
     
      
    5 In the circumstances of this case, manslaughter by criminal negligence involved an omission on the part of each Offender to obtain appropriate medical treatment for Gloria in the period 27 April 2002 to 5 May 2002, without the requirement to establish an intention to cause death or really serious bodily harm, but in circumstances which involved such a great falling short of the standard of care which a reasonable person would have exercised, and which involved such a high risk that death or grievous bodily harm would follow that the doing of the act merited criminal punishment: Nydam v R [1977] VR 430 at 445; The Queen v Lavender (2005) 222 CLR 67 at 75 [17], 87-88 [60], 90 [72].  
     
      
    6 The offence of manslaughter by criminal negligence can be established even if each Offender had not realised that he or she was exposing Gloria to the risk of injury which would have been foreseen by a reasonable person in the position of the Offender. The test is whether a reasonable person, in the position of each Offender, would have realised that the risk existed. 
     
      
    7 There was no issue at the trial that each Offender owed a duty of care, in relation to the wellbeing of Gloria as the father and mother respectively of an infant child - the “reasonable parent” case. There was an issue as to whether any duty of care was owed by Thomas Sam to Gloria as part of the Crown’s “reasonable homeopath” case, which related to him only: R v Sam (No. 17) at [6], Annexure “B”. I will return to this issue later in these reasons. 
     
      
    8 The real issue in the trial (with respect to the “reasonable parent” case) was: 
     
      
       
      (a) whether the omission of each Offender to obtain medical care for Gloria in the period 27 April 2002 to 5 May 2002 was negligent, in that it breached the duty of care which each Offender owed to Gloria and, if so,  
       
       
      (b) whether that omission was a substantial cause of or accelerated Gloria’s death and, if so,  
       
       
      (c) whether that omission amounted to gross criminal negligence and merited criminal punishment because: 
       
       
        
        (i) it fell so far short of the standard of care which a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances; and 
         
         
        (ii) it involved such a high risk that death or really serious bodily harm would follow; and 
         
         
        (iii) the degree of negligence involved in that conduct was so serious that it should be treated as criminal conduct. 
        
       
      
    9 By their verdicts, the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the elements of the offence had been proved against each Offender. The jury was satisfied that the omission of each Offender warranted criminal punishment. 
     
      
    10 It remains for me, as the sentencing Judge, to determine what that criminal punishment ought be. The maximum penalty for the crime of manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years: s.24 Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
       
      Findings of Fact 
       
      
    11 It falls to me as the trial Judge to determine punishment and, for that purpose, to make findings of fact relevant to sentencing. The primary constraint is that the view of the facts adopted by me for the purpose of sentencing must be consistent with the verdicts of the jury. Any findings of fact against the Offenders must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: Cheung v The Queen [2001] 209 CLR 1 at 12-13 [14]. Any findings of fact adverse to the Offenders in these remarks have been reached by application of the criminal standard of proof. 
     
      
    12 If there are matters which each Offender seeks to rely upon in mitigation of penalty, it is sufficient if those matters are proved by the Offender on the balance of probabilities: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] 199 CLR 270 at 281 [27]-[28]. 
     
      
    13 The following findings of fact are based largely upon evidence adduced at the trial. The Offenders did not give evidence at the trial nor in the sentencing proceedings. Each Offender gave a lengthy recorded interview to police in May 2002, which formed part of the evidence before the jury at the trial. 
     
      
       
      The Offenders 
       
      
    14 Thomas Sam was born in India in December 1966 and was 34 years old when Gloria was born on 18 July 2001. Manju Sam was born in India in May 1972 and was 29 years old at the time of Gloria’s birth. The Offenders were married in 1998 and Gloria was the first child born to the Offenders. 
     
      
    15 Thomas Sam was a trained homeopath, with a Bachelors Degree in Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery from the Mangalore University in India, a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Kerala in India and a Masters Degree in Public Health from the University of Western Sydney. He practised as a homeopath in India prior to 1995. After emigrating to Australia, he practised homeopathy in New South Wales from 1995, and taught homeopathy in New South Wales from 1997. At no time was he qualified to practise as a medical practitioner in Australia. 
     
      
    16 Manju Sam obtained a Bachelors Degree in Physics from the University of Kerala in India, and a Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Applications from the Institute of Science and Technology in Kerala. She emigrated to Australia in July 1998, and some months later, commenced employment as an administrative assistant with HCF in Sydney, where she continued to work until Gloria’s birth in 2001.  
     
      
    17 The evidence concerning Gloria unfolded through witnesses who described her condition and testified as to what they told the Offenders, together with photographs taken at times between July 2001 and May 2002. In addition, each Offender gave an account to police in records of interview conducted on 9 May 2002. From these various sources, there emerged a word picture, and pictorial evidence, of Gloria’s physical condition. 
     
      
       
      The Period July 2001 to December 2001 
       
      
    18 The Offenders took Gloria to the Earlwood Early Childhood Centre on four occasions between 25 July 2001 and 4 October 2001, with Gloria’s growth and development being assessed as normal. Photographs of Gloria taken on the date of her birth, and later in September and October 2001, show an apparently healthy and happy infant (Exhibit B, photographs 1-6).  
     
      
    19 Nurse Deborah Lee saw Gloria on 4 October 2001 at the Earlwood Early Childhood Centre, observing at that time eczema on the face and behind the ears. She advised the Offenders to treat the eczema with sorbelene to moisturise the skin to prevent it from getting dry (T166). 
     
      
    20 On 13 November 2001, the Offenders took Gloria again to the Earlwood Early Childhood Centre where she was examined by Nurse Lee. Nurse Lee observed extensive eczema all over Gloria’s body, limbs and face (T167). The eczema had worsened since 4 October 2001. Due to the extensive eczema, she encouraged the Offenders to consult a skin specialist. In the meantime, she advised the Offenders to use baby oil, sorbelene massage and oat baths.  
     
      
    21 The Offenders did not follow the advice of Nurse Lee on 13 November 2001 to see a skin specialist. 
     
      
    22 Photographs in evidence (Exhibit B) provide graphic evidence of the extent of eczema afflicting Gloria at different times. Photograph 7, taken on 30 October 2001, reveals marks on Gloria’s face and legs. Photographs 8 and 9 depict eczema to Gloria’s face, arms, chest and legs on 7 December 2001. Photograph 10 was taken on 13 December 2001. It reveals widespread reddening on Gloria’s body from head to toe, and she is understandably distressed and crying in the photograph. It does not require expert medical evidence to readily infer that an infant afflicted in this way would be suffering pain, and showing her distress by the only available means, namely crying and physical movements.  
     
      
    23 K Oommen George, the uncle of Thomas Sam, was a homeopath living and working in the United States of America. According to the statement of Oommen George read at the trial (T314-315), in late 2001, Thomas Sam telephoned Oommen George seeking advice concerning Gloria, whom Mr Sam explained had been diagnosed with “extensive atopic dermatitis with nutritional imbalance”. Thomas Sam enquired as to academic information concerning homeopathic supplements that Oommen George recommended to improve the child’s health. Oommen George suggested Chamomilla 3X, Hydrocotyle Asiatica 12X, Jugulans Regia 3X and Bablyplex syrup, all of which (according to Oommen George) were recognised supplements for “the improvement of vital energy, micro-nutrition and enrichment under homeopathic vital energy principles”. I accept that Thomas Sam acted upon this advice to apply homeopathic remedies to Gloria. Of course, Oommen George had not seen Gloria in 2001 and his advice must be understood in that light. It was Thomas Sam who was applying the treatments to Gloria. 
     
      
    24 Thomas Sam’s sister, Annie Johnson, lived with her husband and children at the Offenders’ home at Earlwood from Gloria’s birth in July 2001 until 20 December 2001. She assisted the Offenders in that period with Gloria and generally. After 20 December 2001, the Offenders lived alone with Gloria at their Earlwood home. 
     
      
    25 The Offenders did not take Gloria to a medical practitioner between 13 November 2001 and 11 January 2002.  
     
      
       
      The Period 11 January 2002 - 23 February 2002 
       
      
    26 As at January 2002, Thomas Sam worked part time as a homeopath at the Liverpool Medical Centre conducted by Dr Vipin Goyal, a general practitioner. On Friday, 11 January 2002, Dr Goyal observed Manju Sam sitting in the staff area of the practice, nursing her baby. Manju Sam said to Dr Goyal “I want to consult you, Doctor” (T172). No appointment had been made for a consultation. Dr Goyal invited Manju Sam into the consultation room and she told him that she was concerned about her child’s eczema. Dr Goyal examined Gloria and observed widespread eczema on her body, including the face and arms. Manju Sam told Dr Goyal that she had suffered from eczema and asthma in her childhood and there was a family history of eczema. Manju Sam informed Dr Goyal that Gloria was receiving homeopathic treatment. Thomas Sam attended part way through the consultation which his wife had with Dr Goyal on this day. 
     
      
    27 Dr Goyal considered the rash to be serious and warranting referral to a specialist dermatologist. He considered it to be “one of the most serious rashes I have seen” (T172.49). Dr Goyal provided the Offenders with a referral to Dr Phillip Artemi, a dermatologist, practising at Liverpool (Exhibit D). The referral stated that Gloria suffered from “bad atopic eczema” and referred to the mother’s family history of eczema and asthma before concluding “Gloria’s father is a homeopathic doctor and works in our practice to provide holistic medicine”. Dr Goyal informed Manju Sam that Gloria “was serious and she should see [Dr Artemi] at the earliest” (T174.39).  
     
      
    28 Dr Goyal did not see Gloria again. The Offenders did not take Gloria to see Dr Artemi as had been strongly advised by Dr Goyal.  
     
      
    29 Photograph 11 was taken on 15 January 2002, four days after the consultation with Dr Goyal. Gloria’s skin is visibly affected in this photograph as well. Photographs 12, 13 and 14 were taken on 16 January 2002 and graphically depict large areas of angry reddened and elevated skin all over the infant. Gloria is upset and crying in Photograph 13 and I infer that her distress relates directly to the condition then obviously affecting her.  
     
      
    30 It is difficult to understand how reasonable parents who had been strongly advised by Dr Goyal to see a specialist dermatologist, and who had been provided with a referral for this purpose, had not taken Gloria for an assessment and ongoing treatment by Dr Artemi. There was a clear reluctance on the part of the Offenders to obtain, and follow through, specialist medical advice and treatment for Gloria. As will be seen, this was a pattern in the Offenders’ approach to Gloria’s eczema.  
     
      
    31 On 7 February 2002, the Offenders took Gloria to the Earlwood Early Childhood Centre where she was examined by Nurse Melissa Harnett. Gloria’s bare weight had dropped from 6.3 kgs on 13 November 2001 to 6.1 kgs on 7 February 2002. Nurse Harnett considered that a 200-gram loss over a three-month period constituted a substantial lack of growth and she said as much to the Offenders (T189-190). Nurse Harnett attempted to assess Gloria’s developmental stages, but because the baby was quite distressed during the visit, she did not complete the examination. Gloria was crying, appeared uncomfortable and was not pushing up well.  
     
      
    32 Nurse Harnett observed severe eczema on various parts of Gloria’s body with severely broken skin in areas (T188-189). She observed that Gloria was moving constantly and appeared to be itching herself. Nurse Harnett expressed concern to the Offenders that, unless the eczema was stabilised, the baby would continue to have increased energy needs and failure to thrive and develop. She urged the Offenders to see a skin specialist at the Prince of Wales Hospital as soon as possible (T190).  
     
      
    33 Nurse Harnett explained to the Offenders the significance of Gloria’s weight loss and her developmental milestones (T192-193). Nurse Harnett believed that the infant’s energy was being diverted to fight the eczema, and that this was the reason for the lack of growth, and she told the Offenders about this (T207).  
     
      
    34 Nurse Harnett told the Offenders that the quickest way to obtain attention for Gloria was to present at a Children’s Hospital casualty or, alternatively, she could refer them to Dr Brian Symons, a community paediatrician (T193). Arrangements were made for the Offenders and Gloria to see Dr Symons the next day, 8 February 2002. 
     
      
    35 On 8 February 2002, Dr Symons examined Gloria, in the presence of the Offenders, at the Earlwood Early Childhood Centre. Dr Symons was an experienced paediatrician working at that time with the Canterbury Child Adolescent Family Heath Service. He observed extensive eczema and Gloria appeared to be unhappy and was scratching. He had been informed by Nurse Harnett that there had been some weight loss. The Offenders told Dr Symons that they had been using sorbelene cream, cod liver oil, Sigmacort, cortisone ointment together with some homeopathic medicine in treating Gloria for eczema (T210). Dr Symons advised the taking of simple steps such as cutting nails to reduce scratching, and to continue with the treatment which the Offenders were using, with the exception of the homeopathic treatment which he did not know (T212). Dr Symons advised the Offenders that a paediatric skin specialist should become involved. 
     
      
    36 Dr Symons examined Gloria again on 19 February 2002 and there was some improvement. The eczema appeared calmer and less red and angry, and the infant appeared much happier and was laughing again (T214). 
     
      
    37 Dr Symons asked the Offenders whether it would be more convenient for them to attend the Children’s Hospital at Westmead or the Sydney Children’s Hospital at Randwick to see a paediatric dermatologist. The Offenders elected to attend Sydney Children’s Hospital, Randwick. Dr Symons rang the appointment section of the hospital and asked for the earliest appointment, which was set for 4 April 2002 with Dr Wargon, paediatric dermatologist (T214).  
     
      
    38 Some days later, Dr Symons received a telephone call from one of the Offenders. The Offenders had decided that Manju Sam and Gloria should travel to India to stay with Manju Sam’s parents. The Offenders thought that this would provide her with support and assistance. I accept that the call was made by Manju Sam, although it is possible that Thomas Sam spoke to Dr Symons by telephone as well. It is apparent from the records of interview of the Offenders that both of them were entirely familiar with the conversation which occurred with Dr Symons concerning the appointment with the paediatric dermatologist, and the abandonment of that appointment because of proposed travel to India. I am satisfied that Dr Symons expressed, in strong terms, his unhappiness concerning the planned trip by Manju Sam and Gloria to India, which would result in their inability to continue treatment in Sydney and to attend the appointment on 4 April 2002 at Randwick. 
     
      
    39 Thomas Sam acknowledged in his record of interview that Dr Symons was “not happy” and “expressed unhappiness” about the planned trip to India, and the resulting inability to attend the specialist appointment (Exhibit O, Q/A556). Dr Symons made clear to Thomas Sam that specialist treatment should definitely be obtained in India, and Mr Sam assured him that they would be “getting some treatment in India” from a skin specialist (Exhibit O, Q/A558-566). According to Thomas Sam, Dr Symons “was not really happy that we are leaving the country at that time” (Exhibit O, Q/A571).  
     
      
    40 In her record of interview, Manju Sam said that she was concerned that Gloria’s weight had reduced at the time of the second visit to Dr Symons (Exhibit Q, Q/A410-415). Dr Symons’ evidence was that he told Manju Sam that he was unhappy about the trip to India, and that it seemed “cruel” to Gloria (T217.13). Although he was unhappy at this plan, Dr Symons said that he was fortified by the fact that Manju Sam had got in touch with him at all, and had assured him that specialist treatment would be obtained in India. Manju Sam denied, in her record of interview, that Dr Symons used the word “cruel” in their conversation or conversations concerning the trip to India. Although it is not a critical issue for the purpose of sentence, I accept Dr Symons’ evidence that he used the word “cruel” in his conversation with Manju Sam. It is entirely clear that Dr Symons expressed, in no uncertain terms, his unhappiness concerning the trip to India, with the consequential delay in examination of Gloria by a paediatric dermatologist in Sydney. In this context, his suggestion that the journey would be “cruel” to Gloria is an expected comment from a very concerned medical practitioner. 
     
      
    41 Senior counsel for Manju Sam made submissions critical of Dr Symons in his closing address to the jury, which were repeated in submissions on sentence before me. The thrust of the submission was that Dr Symons had not stated that, if the Offenders did not take steps to deal with Gloria’s eczema and its related weight loss, then the position may become extremely dire and life threatening. I do not consider that this argument assists the Offenders. This is a case of manslaughter by criminal negligence. It was not necessary for the Crown to prove that each Offender was informed that the failure to properly treat Gloria’s eczema, and associated weight loss, may lead to death.  
     
      
    42 In any event, it is clear that each Offender had an understanding of the consequences of protracted eczema and associated weight loss. It should be kept in mind that each Offender was well educated with tertiary qualifications in science. Manju Sam acknowledged that she had been told by Nurse Harnett that Gloria’s weight was reduced, and that this could be because her body was “trying to use energy to fight the eczema and she was not gaining much weight” (Exhibit Q, Q/A339). Thomas Sam acknowledged that he was aware, from the time he saw Dr Symons, that Gloria’s development was delayed and that it could be due to eczema (Exhibit O, Q/A779, 796-805). I am satisfied that the Offenders, by the time they had seen Nurse Harnett and Dr Symons in February 2002, were both aware that there was a link between Gloria’s weight loss, and the ongoing eczema which obviously afflicted her and which required a specialist assessment by a paediatric dermatologist. It was apparent to the Offenders, as it would be to any reasonable parent, that the top priority was to ensure thorough and competent medical attention for Gloria, to ensure that she resumed her growth and development. 
     
      
    43 I formed the clear impression that Dr Symons has assumed a heavy burden of self-criticism with respect to his involvement in the assessment and treatment of Gloria. In my view, Dr Symons has been too harsh on himself. He impressed as a caring medical practitioner. He examined Gloria, in his capacity as a community paediatrician, and advised assessment and treatment by a specialist paediatric dermatologist. He made arrangements for the earliest available appointment at the Sydney Children’s Hospital, Randwick for this purpose and intended to monitor Gloria’s treatment and progress in the meantime. The Offenders were aware that there was a link between Gloria’s eczema and her weight-loss problem and her failure to thrive. He advised the Offenders strongly against taking Gloria to India, and away from available methods of assessment and treatment in Sydney. He could not force the Offenders to remain in Australia. Ultimately, he accepted assurances from the Offenders that Gloria would be provided with specialist medical treatment in India. He was entitled to expect that the Offenders, as intelligent parents, would seek specialist medical advice in India and follow through with that advice. It was the Offenders who took Gloria out of Australia, against medical advice.  
     
      
    44 According to the statement of Oommen George, prior to Manju Sam and Gloria travelling to India, he spoke to Thomas Sam by telephone and Mr Sam advised that Gloria’s skin condition had improved. Indeed, according to a statement of Oommen George dated 12 December 2002, he was informed “that the baby is making tremendous progress”. It is difficult to reconcile this statement by Thomas Sam with the observations of Gloria by medical practitioners on 25 February 2002 in India, to which I will turn shortly. 
     
      
       
      Findings Concerning Period 4 October 2001 - 23 February 2002 
       
      
    45 I pause at this stage to assess events between 4 October 2001 and 23 February 2002 concerning the treatment of Gloria’s eczema. Nurse Lee had advised the Offenders on 13 November 2001 to have Gloria examined by a skin specialist. The Offenders failed to do so. Manju Sam saw Dr Goyal on 11 January 2002, leading to a referral to Dr Artemi which was not acted upon by the Offenders. Dr Symons examined Gloria on 8 and 19 February 2002, and advised specialist paediatric dermatological assessment, with arrangements being made for this purpose. The Offenders elected to leave Australia, and not follow through at that time with that arrangement. The Offenders considered that there would be greater family support available to Manju Sam in India. The removal of Gloria from Australia between 23 February and 27 April 2002 was clearly not conducive to a settled and consistent course of treatment of Gloria which could serve to clear up the eczema. 
     
      
    46 I am satisfied that Thomas Sam was applying homeopathic treatment and remedies to Gloria before the departure to India on 23 February 2002. The evidence does not indicate that any homeopath in Australia, apart from Thomas Sam, examined Gloria between October 2001 and 23 February 2002. I accept that Thomas Sam spoke to Mr Vinay Katyal, a homeopath with whom he was associated, concerning Gloria. However, Mr Katyal never examined Gloria. There was an occasion when Thomas Sam made a social visit to Mr Katyal’s home (in the context of Mr Katyal’s wife being diagnosed with cancer) when Thomas Sam was carrying Gloria. There may have been some discussion concerning Gloria in this context, but this was not a consultation or examination.  
     
      
    47 Thomas Sam admitted to Nurse Harnett, Mr Katyal, Dr Varatharajan, Dr Williams and in his own record of interview with police that he had been using homeopathic treatments on Gloria for her eczema. Although it may have been that some of these treatments had originated from Mr Katyal because of the means of exchange of homeopathic supplies (T309.16), I am satisfied that no homeopath in Australia (apart from Thomas Sam) was examining Gloria, and forming an opinion as to what treatments ought be used on her for eczema. This was not a case where a homeopath had prescribed or recommended the use of particular treatments following an examination of Gloria. Rather, I am satisfied that, prior to 23 February 2002, it was Thomas Sam who was exercising his own professional judgment concerning homeopathic treatments to be used on Gloria, during a period when there was medical examination by Dr Goyal and Dr Symons, with strong advice that specialist paediatric dermatological assessment was required. In reaching this conclusion, I have had regard to the evidence of Annie Johnson to the effect that Thomas Sam said he would not treat Gloria as she was a family member. Whatever Thomas Sam may have said, I am satisfied that he was treating Gloria in Australia before 23 February 2002. 
     
      
    48 Although the Crown case focused upon omissions of the Offenders in the period between 27 April 2002 (when they returned to Australia) and 12.01 pm on 5 May 2002 (when they attended the Sydney Children’s Hospital, Randwick), earlier events in Australia up to 23 February 2002 are pertinent. Likewise, events which occurred in India between 23 February and 27 April 2002 are relevant to an assessment of what did and did not happen in the critical nine-day period following the Offenders’ return to Sydney on 27 April 2002. 
     
      
       
      The Period in India Before the Arrival of Thomas Sam - 23 February 2002 to 5 April 2002 
       
      
    49 Manju Sam and Gloria departed Australia on 23 February 2002 bound for India. Thomas Sam remained in Australia at that time because of work commitments, principally relating to teaching of homeopathy. He planned to join his wife and daughter in India in early April 2002. 
     
      
    50 Manju Sam and Gloria travelled to Kerala, in southern India, where they lived for a period with Manju Sam’s parents. At the urging of her parents, Manju Sam took Gloria on 25 February 2002 to the Century Hospital in Kerala, where Gloria was examined by Dr Alexander Mohan, a paediatrician. He observed that the child was alert, although constantly crying. Dr Mohan considered Gloria’s weight gain to be inadequate, although “acceptable”, and he did not recommend any treatment in relation to weight (T459). He found symptoms of extensive widespread dermatitis and eczema, and requested that they consult Dr Thomas, a skin specialist at Century Hospital, that same day. 
     
      
    51 Dr Vipin Thomas, dermatologist, examined Gloria on 25 February 2002 at the request of Dr Mohan. Dr Thomas observed extensive atopic dermatitis in the form of infantile eczema with candidiasis of the nappy area. He informed Manju Sam to avoid allergens, and to give the baby only breast milk or soya bean milk because skin lesions are started by allergens. He prescribed Ampiclox syrup, an antibiotic to combat infection associated with eczema and Loratidine syrup, an antiseptic to relieve itching and other systemic-induced problems. He also prescribed Ampiclox cream, an antifungal cream, to be applied to extremities. He advised Manju Sam to bring Gloria in every alternate day thereafter to assess her progress. Dr Thomas felt that such follow up was appropriate because of the extensive nature of the eczema, and he wished to give “maximum protection” and “maximum diagnosis” (T355-356). Dr Thomas “wanted to be on the safe side so that the patient might get better” (T356.8).  
     
      
    52 Manju Sam did not bring Gloria back for follow-up examination and treatment by Dr Thomas, Dr Mohan or any other medical practitioner at Century Hospital. In fact, Dr Thomas was the last conventional registered medical practitioner to examine Gloria before her attendance and emergency admission to the Sydney Children’s Hospital, Randwick on 5 May 2002. 
     
      
    53 Manju Sam asserted in her record of interview that Gloria’s condition improved with the treatment advised by Dr Mohan and Dr Thomas, so that it was not considered necessary to return as advised by Dr Thomas. I do not accept that any improvement in Gloria’s condition avoided the necessity for ongoing medical examination and treatment in India. It was for medical practitioners to assess Gloria’s progress, and not Manju Sam with homeopathic advice only. There was no impediment whatsoever to Gloria being taken back to Dr Thomas at the Century Hospital for ongoing treatment and assessment. I accept that Thomas Sam played a principal part in this decision. Although not present in India at that time, he was kept aware of all developments as they occurred. Once again, the Offenders disregarded medical advice to follow through with specialist treatment of Gloria. 
     
      
    54 I am satisfied that, after 25 February 2002, Gloria was seen at various times by Mr Punnoose Sam, a homeopath who was the younger brother of Thomas Sam. Punnoose Sam did not give evidence in the trial. Evidence concerning his background and qualifications emerged from the records of interview of the Offenders and the evidence of Annie Johnson. I accept that Punnoose Sam was trained as a homeopath in India. I am satisfied that he was not a registered medical practitioner. Between 25 February 2002 and the arrival of Thomas Sam in India on 5 April 2002, Punnoose Sam was the only health provider of any type who had any involvement in the care of Gloria. 
     
      
    55 I am satisfied that there was daily telephone contact between the Offenders in the period 23 February 2002 to 5 April 2002 so that Thomas Sam was informed of assessments being made (or not made) and treatment being given (or not given) to Gloria for her eczema. I accept that the treatments prescribed by Dr Mohan and Dr Thomas were applied to Gloria, from time to time, together with homeopathic remedies through Punnoose Sam. 
     
      
       
      The Period in India After the Arrival of Thomas Sam - 5 April to 27 April 2002 
       
      
    56 When Thomas Sam arrived in India on 5 April 2002, it was apparent to him that Gloria remained developmentally delayed and below the appropriate weight for an infant of her age. I am satisfied that Gloria, at that time, was obviously afflicted, physically, by eczema. So much is clear from an examination undertaken on 13 April 2002 by a homeopath, Dr Ramanlal Patel. If there had been any improvement in Gloria’s eczema in the period between 25 February and 13 April 2002, I am satisfied that it was minor improvement only, and the child remained consistently visibly afflicted by eczema.  
     
      
    57 At the suggestion of Thomas Sam, Gloria was examined by Dr Patel in his homeopathic clinic at Kottayam. Dr Patel was 77 years old in 2002. His qualifications included a Diploma in Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery from Calcutta Homeopathic Medical College and a Diploma in the Faculty of Homeopathy, London. His further qualifications were set out in his statement read to the jury (T363-365), but these did not suggest that he was a registered practitioner entitled to practise medicine and surgery in the same way as registered medical practitioners such as Dr Mohan and Dr Thomas. Dr Mohan had heard of Dr Patel, but had no direct contact with him (T459). 
     
      
    58 On 13 April 2002, Gloria was first seen by Dr Preetha, a homeopathic assistant to Dr Patel, who conducted an examination and took a history. It was recorded that Gloria had suffered from eczema for four months, and that it was first noticed on the face and hands and then spread to the whole body. The following was recorded (T363-364): 
     
      
       
        
        “There were small eruptions of reddish nature with severe itching and occasionally slight discharge. The child was irritable and had delayed milestones. There was enfoliation of skin, oedematous swelling on legs and the child couldn't bend legs. The child was crying and even slight movements were painful. There was heat sensation in the head. The appetite was good and thirst had increased. It was only fed with breast milk. The child's urine was normal and motion regular. The person who brought the patient also told that the child was given homeopathic medicine, listing Sulphur, Calecarb-30, Thuja-30 (one dose).” 
        
       
      
    59 Dr Preetha noted that “the child was irritable, moaning, sad looking and desired to be carried by someone always”.  
     
      
    60 Dr Patel stated that he then observed and examined Gloria “for about 10 or 15 minutes”. He diagnosed “the disease of the child as atopic dermatitis”. He prescribed the medicine Lycopodium for one month, with Gloria to be brought back in a month’s time. Gloria was not seen again by Dr Patel or anyone else in his clinic. 
     
      
    61 The evidence did not indicate the attributes of Lycopodium, or the indications, or contra-indications, for its use. The only reference to Lycopodium is contained in Exhibit M, Thomas Sam’s Sydney lecture notes for teaching “Paediatrics II - Gastro Intestinal Disorders in Children”, where Lycopodium is listed as a homeopathic medicine indicated for paediatric constipation (pages 11-12).  
     
      
    62 The description of Gloria’s condition upon examination by Dr Preetha on 13 April 2002, taken with earlier descriptions upon examination in February 2002 by Nurse Harnett and Dr Symons, and on 25 February 2002 when examined by Dr Mohan and Dr Thomas, points to a consistent and persistent level of obvious affliction by eczema with an ongoing impact upon Gloria’s health, weight and skin quality. Assessing the position as it stood on 13 April 2002, and without engaging in a process of hindsight, I am satisfied there was a very significant disconnect or gap between the nature of Gloria’s condition when seen by Dr Patel, and the treatment and follow up advised by the homeopath on that occasion. The involvement of Dr Patel could provide no comfort to a reasonable parent against the background of Gloria’s protracted and extensive eczema. This point is further emphasised by what followed after 13 April 2002. Less than a month later, Gloria was dead.63 I accept that Punnoose Sam had some ongoing involvement with Gloria after 13 April 2002.  
     
      
    64 The Offenders and Gloria remained in India until 27 April 2002. Whilst they were in India, it was announced that Punnoose Sam was to become engaged and married, and his wedding took place on about 22 April 2002. Between 13 and 22 April 2002, the Offenders and Gloria travelled around parts of southern India for social purposes. I accept that treatments in the possession of the Offenders were applied to Gloria in this period, although there was no medical examination or supervision of her case.  
     
      
    65 The statement of Oommen George read at the trial did not suggest that he had, at any time, examined Gloria. Annie Johnson gave evidence that Oommen George came to India for the wedding of Punnoose Sam and, in this context, that he had seen Gloria (T706-707, T736-743). I accept that there was a cursory observation of Gloria by Oommen George on Punnoose Sam’s wedding day, which involved the lifting of Gloria’s dress to reveal the rash on her body. This event did not take place in a consultation room. It was little more than a brief opportunity for Oommen George to see the markings on Gloria’s body. I do not accept that this constituted a proper examination of a patient to assist a process of assessment and advice as to treatment. This conclusion is reinforced by the failure of Oommen George to refer, in either of his statements, to the fact that he had examined Gloria in India in April 2002. 
     
      
    66 Between 17 and 23 April 2002, Annie Johnson had opportunities to observe Gloria in India. She said that Gloria’s rash was “not too bad” at that time. On 22-23 April 2002, Manju Sam developed pain and vomiting and Thomas Sam took his wife to hospital in Punalur where she was diagnosed as suffering from gallstones and was provided with conventional medical treatment. In the meantime, Gloria was with Annie Johnson (T646-648). Annie Johnson described Gloria’s skin at this time as being “rashy and liquid was oozing” (T647.41), with the eczema being at a similar level to that which she had observed at its worst in Australia (T648). According to Annie Johnson, Gloria’s “skin was open” and “it appeared red and patchy” (T648.32).  
     
      
    67 There is a notable contrast between the Offenders’ willingness to obtain conventional medical treatment for Manju Sam in April 2002 because of her pain and vomiting, and the failure to obtain, and follow through, consistent conventional medical advice and assistance for Gloria in Australia and India.  
     
      
    68 On 27 April 2002, the Offenders and Gloria returned to Australia. It is appropriate to take stock of the Offenders’ own accounts of Gloria’s health and appearance at the time they departed India to return to Australia. In his record of interview (Exhibit O), Thomas Sam said that Gloria’s eczema had deteriorated since 6 April 2002 with her having “a bit of peeling of the skin, leaving a red appearance” with the peeling in the “axilla and the folds … the underarms, loins and groin” (Q/A1232-1234). Gloria’s general health was “not very good” and she was “probably still declining” and “used to cry … all the time”, “was always irritable” and did not ”want to eat much” (Q/A1233-1240). She was malnourished, her developmental milestones were delayed, she looked tired and had started “developing grey hairs” when her hair used to be “jet black” (Q/A1246-1259).  
     
      
    69 In her record of interview (Exhibit Q), Manju Sam stated that, as at 27 April 2002, Gloria had a rash on most of her folds, under her arms and in her joints with the skin looking “very very red in the armpits, around the stomach area, on her legs and behind her knees” and “some times used to bleed” (Q/A698-705). Manju Sam stated that she did not clothe Gloria because, if she removed the clothes, “if it sticks to her body it can bleed” (Q/A707). Although Manju Sam stated that Gloria’s condition had improved in India, she said that the rash got worse two or three days prior to returning to Australia (Q/A709). 
     
      
    70 Accordingly, on the Offenders’ own accounts, Gloria’s condition on 27 April 2002 involved obvious and severe markings to her skin which inevitably would have caused significant pain and irritation to the infant. 
     
      
    71 Even if Dr Patel’s advice on 13 April 2002 could provide some comfort to the Offenders, it was apparent a fortnight later that Gloria was most unwell, so that any comfort from the involvement of Dr Patel should have evaporated. Any reasonable parent would have been alarmed at Gloria’s condition by this time. It was obvious that urgent medical attention was required.  
     
      
       
      The Flight to Sydney on 27 April 2002 
       
      
    72 The seriousness of Gloria’s condition is borne out by the accounts of a number of passengers on the flight between Singapore and Sydney on 27 April 2002, who observed the Offenders and Gloria during the journey.  
     
      
    73 Linda Nelson observed Gloria’s skin which looked “very red, blotchy, very inflamed” (T323). The baby was quite unsettled, seemed distressed and was crying and was “fussy and distressed for pretty much most of that trip” (T321-323).  
     
      
    74 Ms Nelson’s daughter, Kirby Nelson, described Gloria as “screaming constantly” with a “painful scream” throughout the majority of the flight (T326-328). She observed that the baby had a “rash at the time all over its body pretty much”, with the rash appearing “red and sort of like lumpy” with it covering about 75% of the body (T329). Linda Nelson observed that Thomas Sam appeared gentle with the child (T324-325).  
     
      
    75 Another passenger, Janet Nuttall, was travelling with her husband and three children on the flight. She observed a rash on the baby and said it concerned her, and that she “hadn’t seen a rash like it before” (T333). She stated that Gloria appeared very distressed and was crying a lot, in a way that concerned her. She had travelled on many flights between the United Kingdom and Sydney, and had seen many young children. She did not remember any other child on a flight that she was concerned about, observing that Gloria seemed “inconsolable” (T334). 
     
      
       
      The Final Period in Sydney - 27 April 2002 to 5 May 2002 
        
       
      
    76 Thomas Sam returned to work upon his arrival in Australia. Manju Sam remained at home with Gloria.  
     
      
    77 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Gloria was a very sick child indeed upon her return to Australia on 27 April 2002. Her body was racked by eczema, with oozing sores and extensive areas of red rash on her torso, arms, legs and face.  
     
      
    78 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that for the period between 27 April and 5 May 2002, Gloria made no significant improvement whatsoever. She remained in pain and distress. Her condition worsened. The findings which I make in this respect rely upon the accumulation of evidence, both oral and photographic, describing Gloria’s state over an extended period of time measured in months.  
     
      
    79 The records of interview of the Offenders do not disclose, in my view, any basis for concluding that Gloria’s condition improved at all following their return to Australia. The observations of her condition when admitted to Sydney Children’s Hospital, Randwick on 5 May 2002 strongly support a finding that the child had been afflicted by eczema, with its debilitating consequences on her weight, development and general health, for an extended period of time. Forms of homeopathic treatment (principally) and some conventional medical treatment were utilised, as advised by the few doctors who had examined her, with superficial and transient effects at best. 
     
      
    80 It is important to observe that the Crown case at trial focused upon the omission by the Offenders to obtain medical treatment for Gloria between 27 April and 5 May 2002. The written directions provided to the jury emphasised that this period was the focus of attention. It is the fact that no registered medical practitioner nor homeopath examined Gloria at all in this period, apart from the involvement of Thomas Sam in her care and treatment. 
     
      
    81 It is appropriate to refer to the accounts of the Offenders as to what was done, and not done, concerning Gloria in this period. In his record of interview, Thomas Sam said that Gloria was looking better upon their return to Australia (Q/A1419). I do not accept this account, which does not accord with the totality of the evidence. He said that Gloria was being treated with medicine obtained from Dr Patel in India and that this was helping (Q/A1436, 1439). I bear in mind that the only treatment advised by Dr Patel was Lycopodium. Thomas Sam said that, by Friday, 3 May 2002, Gloria had developed a red rash in the eye and, on Saturday, it looked like an ulcer in the cornea (Q/A1442). He said that she was not crying as much as she did in India (Q/A1510). Thomas Sam said that, on 4 May 2002, he gave Gloria homeopathic medicine, Cineriamaritima, for her eye (Q/A1493-1494). He said that, on the Saturday night, he and his wife were “a bit concerned” and, on the Sunday morning, the ulcer was spreading in the cornea and there was redness, pus and the discolouration was becoming thicker (Q/A1586). He stated, however, that he was tired and Gloria was sleeping, as was his wife, so that they did not go to the hospital (Q/A1598-1600). He said that, on Sunday, Gloria was not looking healthy, her crying was getting worse and the rash was spreading (Q/A1447, 1452). He observed that he did not see the rash because he had been working, and he relied on his wife to tell him about the rash (Q/A1463).  
     
      
    82 On the morning of Sunday, 5 May 2002, he and his wife decided to go to the hospital, but this was delayed to allow Thomas Sam to attend to duties at a church service that morning (Q/A1648, 1755).  
     
      
    83 In her record of interview, Manju Sam stated that Gloria’s skin condition was improving upon their return to Australia and that she was taking food including solids and breast milk (Q/A728). I do not accept Manju Sam’s account that Gloria’s skin condition was improving upon their return to Australia. I am satisfied that it continued to worsen from the state observed by the aircraft passengers on 27 April 2002. She stated that Gloria was being given homeopathic medicine and baby tonic once a day, being medicine and tonic obtained in India (Q/A716, 722, 725, 833). In addition, Manju Sam said she used the cortisone cream prescribed by Dr Symons. The one tube of cortisone cream had lasted from 8 February to 5 May 2002 (Q/A1019).  
     
      
    84 Manju Sam explained that she and her husband had not taken Gloria for medical attention upon their return to Australia “because we were sort of recovering from jet lag and it was very hot in India, we were very tired, very drained” (Q/A711).  
     
      
    85 Manju Sam said that, by 30 April 2002, she and her husband were discussing taking Gloria to the doctor and the prospect of contacting Dr Symons, but they did not do so (Q/A772-812). With respect to jet lag, Manju Sam stated that “we were very tired” and she remembered sleeping for two to three days after returning to Australia (Q/A788). She acknowledged that she was Gloria’s primary carer, and that she and Gloria stayed at home and went nowhere from 27 April 2002 until their attendance at the Sydney Children’s Hospital on 5 May 2002 (Q/A733). She noted a discolouration in Gloria’s eye on Friday, 3 May 2002 and, by Saturday, Gloria’s eye had a lot of pus (Q/A815, 870, 906). 
     
      
    86 Senior counsel for Manju Sam referred to the evidence of Maria Dos Santos, the downstairs neighbour of the Offenders, who said that, on the occasions that she was present, she did not hear the baby cry in the period 27 April 2002 - 5 May 2002. Ms Dos Santos was at work at times in this period. I do not think her evidence assists on this issue. If Gloria was not audibly crying as often in this period, I am satisfied that this was not because of any contented state. She was a very sick infant with eroding skin. Her distress would have been apparent to her parents.  
     
      
    87 I do not accept the Offenders’ accounts concerning Gloria’s health and appearance following 27 April 2002. I am satisfied that each Offender understated significantly in their interviews the true condition of Gloria in the critical period leading to 5 May 2002. 
     
      
       
      Attendance at Sydney Children’s Hospital, Randwick - 5 May 2002 
       
      
    88 Finally, at 12.01 pm on Sunday, 5 May 2002, after Thomas Sam had returned home from church, the Offenders took Gloria to the Sydney Children’s Hospital, Randwick. The nursing and medical staff recognised immediately the urgency of Gloria’s condition. The descriptions of Gloria and the assessments and responses of nursing and medical staff at the hospital constitute potent evidence of Gloria’s obvious and profound deterioration. The range of nursing and medical staff who were deployed rapidly on a Sunday afternoon in Sydney also points starkly to the resources available, if only the Offenders had sought earlier treatment for Gloria. 
     
      
    89 Nurse Frances Brogan observed a distressed and crying infant, with extensive eczema covering her whole body and with a purulent discharge coming from both eyes. Nurse Brogan was shocked and wanted Gloria to be seen quickly by a doctor. 
     
      
    90 Within minutes, Gloria was examined by Dr Susannah Cunningham, the Paediatric Emergency Registrar. Dr Cunningham said that Gloria was squealing and distressed when touched and was severely malnourished, with a weight of 5.4 kgs (T404). She had large patches of excoriated raw skin which looked angry, red and moist. The skin was cracked in areas. The baby was in severe pain. Dr Cunningham considered that the child had been in severe pain for a period of days, if not longer (T405). The infant was in so much pain every time her skin was exposed, and her arms or legs were straightened, that Dr Cunningham opted to take Polaroid photographs of Gloria so that each new doctor could look at the photographs and leave Gloria without having to cause her further pain or distress (T408).  
     
      
    91 The Polaroid photographs taken by Dr Cunningham (Exhibit B, photographs 16 and 17) depict a severely upset infant with very extensive areas of reddening to the body. The photographs constitute tragic and eloquent evidence concerning the condition which had racked Gloria’s body for some time, with inevitable associated pain and distress.  
     
      
    92 Dr Penelope Lee, dermatologist, examined Gloria. She observed an eroded eruption to Gloria’s torso, groin and armpits so that the top surface of the skin, the epidermis, had completely eroded away and there was no skin remaining. This was obviously painful and Gloria was very distressed every time she was moved upon examination (T424). Dr Lee formed the view that Gloria was “incredibly sick” with “this massive eroded rash”. Dr Lee had never seen anything like it before in her life (T430).  
     
      
    93 Dr Orli Wargon, paediatric dermatologist, observed a very small baby with hair colour “that looked like pure wool” with her skin looking very painful and eroded and her eye appearing cloudy (T438). Dr Wargon considered Gloria to be in extreme pain, and thus conducted her examination quickly as there was an urgency to address her other health issues including her pain (T441).  
     
      
    94 Dr Matthew O’Meara, the head of the Children’s Emergency, examined Gloria and considered that her immediate priorities at that time were pain relief, fluids and electrolyte management and identification of the cause of her skin problem and her malnutrition. He said that Gloria was “grossly malnourished” and was in pain and quite distressed, such that he gave her morphine for her pain (T471-472). Dr O’Meara observed that Gloria’s weight was considerably below the third percentile and her length had dropped below the second percentile (T475).  
     
      
    95 Dr Gary Williams, the Senior Staff Specialist in the Children’s Intensive Care, observed Gloria to be “a pale thin baby” with thin hair, broad cracked nails, slightly swollen extremities and a widespread eroded indurated moist erythematous rash with overlying caked secretions or discharge (T481). He observed that some of the inflamed areas of the skin had been present so long that scarring had occurred to thicken the skin (T481.24). Dr Williams expressed the opinion that, if Gloria had received conventional medical care and nutritional support at an earlier stage, “she would not have been so susceptible to overwhelming grand negative infection” (T484). Dr Williams considered that Gloria’s skin condition had existed for some considerable time (T488).  
     
      
    96 Dr Robert Chong, the Registrar Ophthalmologist, examined Gloria in an effort to assess her quality of vision from each eye. 
     
      
    97 Dr Monique Stone, paediatrician, observed that Gloria had an extensive ulcerated rash that covered most of her body and she had “a high pitched distressed cry when disturbed, particularly when the dressings were removed” (T522). It was clear to Dr Stone that Gloria was very unwell and required high-dependency nursing and medical care (T522).  
     
      
    98 Dr Ian Kennedy, ophthalmologist, examined Gloria and said her condition was very unusual and he had never seen such a case (T526). With respect to Gloria’s left eye, he observed that it would be very difficult to have treated the eye and save it (T527). He considered that the condition in Gloria’s left eye could have developed within a matter of days (T527). In order for a cornea to melt, it must progressively thin and perforate and this process could be a fairly long-term one over a matter of weeks (T528).  
     
      
    99 Gloria was admitted and treated at the Sydney Children’s Hospital until her death at 1.20 am on 8 May 2002.  
     
      
    100 Dr Ella Sugo, pathologist, performed an autopsy on the child and concluded that she died from disseminated infection which caused, in the agonal stages immediately before death, bleeding from the lungs and airways. The infection developed on a background of chronic eczema and significant protein-energy malnutrition. In summary, Dr Sugo explained that the eczema was accompanied by malnutrition that affected Gloria’s immunity, and she experienced disseminated infection throughout her entire body which caused her lungs to bleed which led to her death (T536).  
     
      
       
      Opinions of Other Expert Witnesses 
       
      
    101 A number of medical witnesses who did not have an opportunity to examine Gloria were called by the Crown to give evidence at the trial. The opinions of these witnesses were based upon an examination of reports, records and photographs and they provide further insight into Gloria’s condition, in particular, in the period 27 April to 5 May 2002.  
     
      
    102 Dr Lorna Scott, a registered medical practitioner and qualified homeopath, observed that Gloria appeared tired and lethargic with raw and weeping skin following the family’s return to Sydney, and that these were “features of a very unwell child” (T574). By 27 April 2002, Dr Scott observed that Gloria was irritable, lethargic, sleeping a lot and always wanting to be on the breast, underweight and the skin rash had altered in appearance to large raw peeling areas in the armpit, groin, lower back and abdomen and that this “was not a simple case of atopic eczema” and should have been “a delineation point” (T575). Dr Scott observed that the cortisone cream that the parents were apparently applying to the raw skin surfaces was inappropriate and ineffective, and that the raw weeping skin would have provided a surface for infecting organisms to take hold, and the baby’s debilitated state made it even more likely to become a generalised infection or septicaemia (T575). 
     
      
    103 Dr Alison Kesson is the head of the Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology at the Children’s Hospital, Westmead. Dr Kesson observed that, as at 27 April 2002, there was evidence of widespread severe eczema affecting Gloria, that her condition at that time was very severe and there was clear evidence that she had significant developmental delay, in that she was not doing the things that would be expected of a normal eight or nine-month old baby (T675). 
     
      
    104 Dr Kesson said that Gloria would have been extensively colonising pseudomonas aeruginosa due to her wet skin condition for several months, although it was difficult to time when her infection became systemic, and it was difficult to determine exactly when, in place and time, the provision of therapy would have prevented death (T676). Dr Kesson observed that systemic infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa is life threatening and must be treated as early as possible, and very aggressively, to ensure survival. It is a condition usually observed in severely immuno-suppressed individuals.  
     
      
    105 In Dr Kesson’s view, the latest time to commence therapy, and prevent Gloria’s acute death, was probably 24 to 48 hours prior to presentation at the Sydney Children’s Hospital, Randwick on 5 May 2002 (T677). In Dr Kesson’s opinion, if Gloria had been brought to hospital one week earlier, she probably would have survived, but the other complication was her very serious malnutrition and very poor general status (T677).  
     
      
    106 Dr Kesson had never seen eczema this severe. She observed that there was significant ulceration of the skin, and suspected strongly that there was a lot of tissue fluid leaking through the skin which was moist and subsequently colonised, and then infected, with pseudomonas aeruginosa (T679). Dr Kesson considered that the ulcerated skin would have been painful, and that every time Gloria passed urine she would have acid ulcers on her skin which would have been extremely painful (T680). Dr Kesson concluded that, if medical help had been sought as soon as Gloria had returned to Australia, her life would have been prolonged (T682). 
     
      
    107 Dr Alyson Kakakios is a paediatric immunologist at the Children’s Hospital, Westmead. Dr Kakakios relied on photographs of Gloria to assist her expression of opinion. Dr Kakakios considered that malnutrition had clearly been present for some time, possibly from six months of age and had not been appropriately managed (T776). Dr Kakakios believed that Gloria had been seriously ill for several weeks (T776). It was the opinion of Dr Kakakios that, if Gloria had been brought to hospital a week earlier, her life could have been saved (T778). From the report, Dr Kakakios considered that Gloria was manifesting a degree of malnutrition which was severe, that she had peripheral oedema (a swelling of the limbs) and was otherwise grossly underweight for her age (T778). Dr Kakakios observed that children with a severe degree of inflammation such as Gloria’s eczema, feel extremely unwell, do not have appetite and in general cannot take in the amount of nutrition that is required (T778). With the degree of inflammation which Dr Kakakios considered that Gloria had experienced, she believed that Gloria would have been in pain for weeks (T779). 
     
      
    108 Dr Frank Martin is a paediatric ophthalmologist at the Children’s Hospital, Westmead. Dr Martin considered that Gloria’s right eye could possibly have retained some vision if she had survived but the left eye would most likely have been blind. In the days prior to her admission on 5 May 2002, Dr Martin considered that Gloria’s corneas would more than likely have some haze, and he would have expected her eye to have lost its clarity and taken on a greyish appearance (T800). In Dr Martin’s opinion, Gloria would have experienced photophobia (sensitivity to light) and pain in both eyes, as even a tiny ulcer on the cornea causes severe pain (T801). Dr Martin considered that the changes in Gloria’s eye would have been noticeable to the naked eye several days prior to her admission on 5 May 2002 (T802).  
     
      
    109 The expert medical evidence recently summarised supports and reinforces findings which I have made concerning the longevity of Gloria’s eczema, its obvious physical manifestations and the detrimental consequences upon Gloria’s general health. In addition, this evidence emphasises the prospect of Gloria being treated, with the prospect of being saved, if she had received appropriate medical treatment in the days following 27 April 2002.  
     
      
       
      Conditions Affecting Gloria 
       
      
    110 Defence submissions were made to the jury, some of which were repeated before me on sentence, concerning the condition or conditions which affected Gloria. There was some scientific debate, between a number of medical witnesses, concerning the precise condition or conditions from which Gloria suffered at the end of her life. Particular reference was made to kwashiorkor, a condition usually seen in malnourished children in third world countries. I do not consider that these issues bear upon the issues which I must determine for the purpose of passing sentence. Rather, the pertinent facts, in my view, are as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) Gloria was growing and meeting her developmental milestones until eczema manifested itself in October 2001; 
       
       
      (b) from October 2001 until her death in May 2002, Gloria consistently suffered from eczema, which was treated ineffectively, and thus persisted in an obvious form; 
       
       
      (c) Gloria’s system utilised energy from her food intake to fight the eczema, rather than to assist her own growth and development so that she failed to meet developmental milestones - this fact was known to the Offenders, with them also being aware by 8 February 2002 of the energy-sapping process involving diversion of energy to fight the eczema; 
       
       
      (d) the ongoing effects over the months upon Gloria, her skin, weight, development and behaviour were obvious for the Offenders to see; 
       
       
      (e) the failure to provide proper and effective medical treatment over a period of time led to the development of conditions in Gloria, certainly in the period 27 April 2002 to 5 May 2002 (if not before) which were life threatening, if not properly treated; 
       
       
      (f) by 5 May 2002, Gloria’s condition was such that the administration of medical treatment to her could not save her life; 
       
       
      (g) Gloria’s body was worn down, and ultimately worn out, so that she was susceptible to serious infection; 
       
       
      (h) the infection which killed her was the final step in a series of events involving the deterioration of Gloria’s health because of the failure to obtain appropriate medical treatment for her eczema - it was the final domino to fall. 
       
      
    111 These findings are consistent with Dr Sugo’s opinion as to cause of death (see [100]), which I accept. This is not a case of a hidden condition going untreated and ultimately causing death. Rather, this case involves an accumulation of obvious health problems which, whilst not properly treated, saw the child descending towards death. 
     
      
       
      Subjective Circumstances of the Offenders 
       
      
    112 I have referred earlier to the personal circumstances of the Offenders, including age, background and education. Each Offender has no prior convictions. There is a substantial body of evidence adduced in the case of each Offender of their good works in India and in Australia.  
     
      
    113 Each Offender had the benefit of a supportive and stable upbringing, a supportive family and significant educational opportunities in India. 
     
      
    114 Character evidence was adduced in the case of each Offender, with oral evidence being given in the case of Thomas Sam, in addition to documentary character evidence.  
     
      
    115 The Offenders have been members of a Christian church in India and Australia. Friends and associates from the church provided character evidence for each Offender. 
     
      
    116 Professional, medical and homeopathic colleagues of Thomas Sam provided evidence of his capacity and character, as did some of his patients. A pro-forma reference was signed by some 185 persons, including friends and family. 
     
      
    117 I note that a referee for Manju Sam, Dr John Ashton, a dentist who has known her since 1998 in connection with her employment with HCF, described her as a “compliant and rather non-assertive woman who was deferential to authority”.  
     
      
    118 Work colleagues of Manju Sam provided character evidence concerning her character and capacity. 
     
      
    119 Thomas Sam was a hard-working homeopath. Positive evidence was tendered in his case concerning his reputation and capacity as a homeopath. As a result of these proceedings, he will lose his professional capacity to practise in Australia.  
     
      
    120 Manju Sam worked consistently in a responsible administrative position in Sydney before and after Gloria’s death. The evidence points to her reputation and capacity in that employment.  
     
      
    121 A three-year old son was born to the Offenders in 2006. A report of Dr Christopher Lennings, psychologist, addressed the adverse impact upon this child if the Offenders were imprisoned. Dr Lennings said that the boy presented as a reasonably well-adjusted child and that deleterious consequences to him would flow from the imprisonment of both of the Offenders. Other evidence established that the boy had been treated successfully for eczema by a combination of conventional medicine and homeopathy. 
     
      
    122 Psychiatric and psychological reports were tendered with respect to the Offenders. Dr Katie Seidler, psychologist, saw Manju Sam on 16 June 2009 and furnished a report. Dr Seidler referred to Manju Sam’s difficulty in coping in 2002 and raised the prospect that she was depressed at the time. Her report described ongoing symptoms of anxiety and stress in relation to Gloria’s death. 
     
      
    123 Dr Stephen Allnutt, psychiatrist, examined Thomas Sam in custody on 29 July 2009 and 9 August 2009. Mr Troy Spiers, psychologist, had seen Thomas Sam on some 18 occasions between September 2008 and June 2009 for cognitive behavioural therapy sessions. Dr Keith Kennett, psychologist, examined Thomas Sam on 19 June 2009. 
     
      
    124 It was accepted by the parties before me that the psychological evidence concerning Thomas Sam and Manju Sam should not cross the barrier of expertise, so as to enter into the field of psychiatry: R v Peisley (1990) 54 A Crim R 42 at 52; R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 36) [2008] NSWSC 626 at [164]. I approach the psychological evidence in this way, and will disregard any purported diagnosis by a psychologist of a psychiatric condition. I bear in mind, as well, that neither Offender gave evidence at the trial or in the sentencing proceedings, and that this affects the weight to be given to their accounts to the report authors: R v Qutami (2001) 127 A Crim R 369 at 377 [58]; R v Palu (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 at 184-185 [39]-[41]. 
     
      
    125 There is an especially significant aspect of the psychological evidence to which reference should be made. As I have said, Mr Spiers saw Thomas Sam for 18 sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy between September 2008 and June 2009. Mr Spiers described characteristics in Thomas Sam of self-grandiosity and arrogant behaviour, involving boasting of his professional credentials as a homeopath and emphasising his spiritual maturity as a Christian. Clearly, Mr Spiers was in a position to form a view concerning these features, given his extended dealings with Thomas Sam over a nine-month period. Mr Spiers observed that the attitudes and behaviour which he had seen in Thomas Sam were consistent with a provisional diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder. Dr Allnutt, psychiatrist, did not consider that Thomas Sam qualified for diagnosis with an antisocial personality disorder, and he was unable to diagnose narcissistic personality disorder based on the information provided to him. Dr Allnutt observed, however, that Mr Spiers had seen Thomas Sam for 18 sessions and he accepted the observation of Mr Spiers that Thomas Sam manifested some narcissistic personality traits over this period. Amongst the factors which Dr Allnutt thought may have contributed to the offence by Thomas Sam was a rigid preference for homeopathic treatment approaches in dealing with Gloria. 
     
      
    126 Having regard to the limitations upon the use of psychological evidence in reaching psychiatric diagnoses, a clear foundation for a finding that Manju Sam was depressed at the time of the offence is not apparent. A further difficulty arises from the fact that Dr Seidler saw Manju Sam once only, in June 2009, seven years after the relevant events. There is no contemporaneous medical evidence concerning Manju Sam’s condition in July 2001 - May 2002. Reference was made by counsel to Manju Sam’s appearance in the record of interview of 9 May 2002. I do not think this provides a platform for a diagnosis of depression. Nevertheless, I accept that Manju Sam was experiencing some level of stress as a result of Gloria’s protracted illness and that her reaction was, in these circumstances, somewhat blunted.  
     
      
    127 Although I accept that Thomas Sam has been affected adversely, and become depressed, as a result of these proceedings, I am not satisfied that he was suffering from any disorder at the time of the offence. Dr Allnutt’s report does not support such a conclusion. Dr Kennett’s report moves beyond the limits of psychological assessment, and senior counsel for Thomas Sam did not seek to rely upon it in that respect (T83-92, 13 August 2009). 
     
      
       
      Objective Seriousness of Offences 
       
      
    128 Implicit in the verdicts of the jury is a finding, to the criminal standard, that the Offenders fell far short of the standard of care of Gloria which a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances, such as to constitute gross criminal negligence.  
     
      
    129 The Crown submitted on sentence that these were objectively grave crimes of manslaughter, with the offence of Thomas Sam being more serious than that of his wife. The offences did not involve an isolated act or omission, but rather a prolonged, sustained and deliberate decision by each Offender, individually and jointly, not to seek proper medical attention for Gloria over a very substantial period of time. It was submitted that the Offenders’ continuing course of omission resulted in their infant daughter suffering what must have been considerable pain and discomfort for most of the final five months of her life. The Crown submitted that the Offenders’ omissions led to Gloria not only enduring a most extreme form of infected eczema, and a cessation of her developmental milestones, but also severe malnutrition which took time to develop. These omissions, the Crown contended, led finally to what must have been a particularly painful bilateral, and ultimately fatal eye infection. 
     
      
    130 It was submitted for the Offenders that they were caring parents who had taken steps to obtain assistance for Gloria from both medical and homeopathic sources. It was submitted that the Offenders were unaware of the full medical ramifications of Gloria’s condition and that this served to explain their delay in taking her to hospital in May 2002. It was said that this was a case of misguided conduct by the Offenders, and not an approach of not caring at all for Gloria’s welfare. 
     
      
    131 I must keep in mind that the offence of manslaughter by criminal negligence involves an objective test, focusing upon the response of a reasonable person to the circumstances. Nevertheless, it is relevant on sentence to have regard to any explanation or explanations for the omission by the Offenders to seek medical assistance for their daughter.  
     
      
    132 I am satisfied that this is a most serious case of manslaughter by criminal negligence. I am satisfied that Gloria’s condition, certainly by 27 April 2002, was clearly serious and demanded proper medical treatment and that this was obvious to any reasonable parent. This is not a case of a child suffering from a serious condition which was disguised in some way. Gloria’s body had been racked by eczema for a considerable period of time with associated pain and discomfort. 
     
      
    133 I accept that Gloria was subjected to significant pain over an extended period of time, and that the omission of the Offenders to seek proper assistance for her may be characterised accurately as cruelty. Gloria suffered helplessly and unnecessarily while suffering from a condition that was treatable.  
     
      
    134 I accept the Crown submission that the Offenders preferred homeopathic measures to conventional medical treatment for Gloria. I am satisfied that Thomas Sam displayed (and continued to display) an arrogant approach to what he perceived to be the superior benefits of homeopathy compared with conventional medicine. I am satisfied that Thomas Sam’s approach, in this respect, operated upon the attitude of Manju Sam, who was inclined to defer to her husband on this issue. 
     
      
    135 I am satisfied that the aspects observed by Mr Spiers impacted upon Thomas Sam’s approach to Gloria’s condition, and that Manju Sam acquiesced in that approach. These factors shed light upon the gross failings of the Offenders to respond in a timely fashion, or at all, to Gloria’s serious condition. Gloria was totally dependent upon her parents complying with their clear duty of care for her, and each Offender fell profoundly short of their parental obligations to their infant daughter. 
     
      
    136 I accept that this protracted process itself, served to blunt Manju Sam, to some extent, to Gloria’s needs. 137 For the purpose of sentence, it is appropriate to characterise the case of Thomas Sam as a most serious offence of manslaughter, applying the “reasonable parent” test. He was a parent, who also happened to be a homeopath, and thus possessed the advantage of training and knowledge flowing from that qualification. This aspect serves to aggravate the seriousness of his offence by reference to the “reasonable parent” test. 
     
      
    138 I should, nevertheless, make findings with respect to the Crown’s “reasonable homeopath” case. The only constant homeopath or medical practitioner in Gloria’s life between October 2001 and May 2002 was Thomas Sam. As outlined earlier, various medical practitioners were consulted along the way, but there was no follow through. Nor was there consistent homeopathic treatment provided to Gloria throughout this period by any person, other than by Thomas Sam.  
     
      
    139 By the time one comes to the critical period between 27 April and 5 May 2002, it may be observed, somewhat starkly, that either Thomas Sam was treating Gloria or no one was. Although Thomas Sam sought, in his police interview, to distance himself from regular observations of Gloria in this period because of the demands of his work, I am satisfied that he had regular opportunities to observe Gloria, and to form a view concerning treatment which ought be given. The Offenders had in their possession a range of medical and homeopathic treatments, which had been accumulated from different sources.  
     
      
    140 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Thomas Sam was treating Gloria in the period 27 April to 5 May 2002, so that a patient-homeopath relationship existed between them at that time. This treatment was cursory, but it was treatment nevertheless. The fact that he was utilising substances obtained from different sources does not mean that he was not treating Gloria at that time. However, such treatment as he provided was grossly inadequate.  
     
      
    141 The universal view of homeopaths who gave evidence at the trial (Dr Scott, Ms Cresswell and Mr Katyal), was that homeopathic treatment could be tried for a period but, if there was no improvement, medical assessment was necessary. Each witness emphasised that homeopathy complemented conventional medicine, and was not intended to be a substitute for the treatment of conditions which called for conventional medical assessment and treatment. This was the professional standard which applied to Thomas Sam in Australia, a standard which he clearly breached in a grave respect. On any reasonable view, the time when homeopathy had been tried without success, and that consistent conventional medical treatment was required, was the visit to Dr Goyal on 11 January 2002. It was overwhelmingly clear that homeopathy would not suffice for the state of affairs which was apparent by 27 April 2002. 
     
      
    142 Accordingly, I am satisfied that the sentencing of Thomas Sam should be approached upon the basis that he is culpable with respect to both the “reasonable parent” test and the “reasonable homeopath” test. 
     
      
    143 I accept that Thomas Sam’s offence is objectively greater than Manju Sam’s offence, given his dominant role and her reliance upon his homeopathic knowledge.  
     
      
    144 That said, Manju Sam was the child’s mother and was constantly in the presence of the child in the nine-day period up to 5 May 2002. She had ample opportunity to take Gloria to a medical practitioner or a hospital in that period, and there was no impediment to that course of action. Her explanation for not doing so referred to jetlag and tiredness. Although it may be said that Manju Sam had, to an extent, been worn down by the ongoing demands of Gloria because of her condition, I am satisfied that Gloria’s condition was obvious to her, as was her pain and suffering, so that the omission of Manju Sam to obtain medical treatment in this period constituted a grave example of gross criminal negligence. Manju Sam was Gloria’s mother, the person from whom, above all others, the child was entitled to expect nurture, care, sustenance and protection, and she failed the child in her most important duty, with fatal results: R v O’Brien [2003] NSWCCA 121 at [74].  
     
      
    145 Relevant events occurred over an extended period of time. This was not a flawed decision made in pressured circumstances over a short period of time.  
     
      
    146 I am satisfied that a very wide chasm lay between the approach of the Offenders to Gloria’s condition, and that which a reasonable parent would have taken in all the circumstances. 
     
      
       
      Delay and Effect of Imprisonment Upon the Offenders’ Son 
       
      
    147 Senior counsel for each Offender pointed to the delay between Gloria’s death in May 2002 and the initiation of criminal proceedings against them by the filing of an ex-officio indictment in this Court in December 2008. Evidence was given in the trial explaining this delay by reference to an extended investigation involving complex medical issues and overseas investigations, and then an inquest held in November 2007, culminating in the referral of the papers by the State Coroner to the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
     
      
    148 Although more than six-and-a-half years passed before criminal proceedings were commenced, the matter came to trial in this Court within six months. 
     
      
    149 I accept that the delay was not contributed to by the Offenders. They were interviewed by police in May 2002. They were aware that there was a possibility of criminal proceedings being brought against them thereafter. The Offenders remained in Australia, continuing their employment and, in 2006, another child was born to their marriage. I accept that the Offenders have experienced a protracted period of uncertainty and stress whilst the investigation of Gloria’s death, and subsequent prosecution, were in progress. These are factors which ought be taken into account in their favour on sentence.  
     
      
    150 It was submitted for the Offenders that the adverse impact upon their son, if both were imprisoned, is a factor to be taken into account in their favour on sentence. It is only in exceptional circumstances that the adverse impact upon the family of offenders may be taken into account to mitigate penalty. The fact of imprisonment almost inevitably leads to hardship, sometimes very serious hardship, to third parties and justice will not be seen to be administered even-handedly if exceptions are made on this account in cases which are not truly exceptional: Hopley v R [2008] NSWCCA 105 at [39]. The children of every person who is sent to prison may suffer, in some way or other, as a result of that imprisonment. Here, the focus has been upon the impact upon the son if both parents are sent to prison. 
     
      
    151 The combination of delay in the investigation and prosecution, taken with the Offenders having a further child, are factors which I will take into account in mitigation of penalty. I accept that exceptional circumstances exist here which warrant the Court taking into account the adverse impact upon the Offenders’ son from their imprisonment. 
     
      
    152 Nevertheless, it remains necessary to ensure that sentences imposed reflect the objective seriousness of the crimes and are proportionate to the criminality of each Offender. 
     
      
       
      Determining Appropriate Sentences 
       
      
    153 The Offenders have been found guilty of the unlawful homicide of Gloria, their infant daughter. It is necessary that the sentences to be imposed reflect a significant element of general deterrence given the need for the community to understand the serious consequences of parents breaching the trust reposed in them to care for their infant children, culminating in unlawful homicide of the child. The protection of children is of fundamental importance to society: R v Howard [2001] NSWCCA 309 at [19]. A heavy responsibility rests upon parents to care for a child who is utterly defenceless: R v Wilkinson [1999] NSWCCA 248 at [26]. The fundamental consideration is that the sentences to be imposed must accord with the general moral sense of the community: R v Foulstone (NSWCCA, 18 July 1990). 
     
      
    154 Without leading to a position of double punishment, the sentence to be imposed upon Thomas Sam must also reflect an element of general deterrence directed to alternative health providers who may fail to ensure a patient receives conventional medical treatment where the patient is not responding appropriately to alternative treatment. 
     
      
    155 It has been emphasised that the crime of manslaughter extends to a wide variety of circumstances: R v Forbes (2005) 160 A Crim R 1 at [133]-[134]; R v Jagroop [2009] VSCA 46 at [7]ff. The fundamental starting point is that the actions of the Offenders involved the criminal taking of a human life. It is the responsibility of the courts to protect and preserve human life and to punish those who unlawfully take it: R v Dawes [2004] NSWCCA 363 at [31]. 
     
      
    156 I have weighed the serious objective circumstances of the offences with the subjective factors which the Offenders call in aid on sentence. I take into account, in favour of the Offenders, evidence of good character and good works on their behalf and the consequences of delay, together with their current family circumstances, and the impact upon their son which would flow from their imprisonment. I have regard as well to the effective termination of Thomas Sam’s career as a homeopath and the effect upon the Offenders of the publicity surrounding these proceedings. 
     
      
    157 It is the frequent experience of the criminal courts that offenders in cases of manslaughter of a child by criminal negligence are persons affected by social disorder, substance abuse and limited intelligence and education. This is not such a case. The Offenders are intelligent and well educated. Each had the benefit of a good and supportive upbringing in caring families. There is nothing in the backgrounds of the Offenders which assists either of them on sentence. Indeed, these features operate against the Offenders on sentence. 
     
      
    158 The verdicts and sentences in this case do not involve some adverse judgment on the practice of homeopathy. The evidence reflected that homeopathy has a significant role to play in the community, as a complement to conventional medicine, for a range of conditions. However, the unanimous view of homeopaths who gave evidence at the trial was that the limitations of homeopathy must be kept in mind, and that referral to medical practitioners was both appropriate and necessary where improvement was not manifest from homeopathic treatment. This case does not concern the failure of homeopathy. Rather, it concerns the gross criminal negligence of two parents who failed to ensure that their infant daughter received necessary and appropriate medical care and attention for a treatable condition.  
     
      
    159 Both Offenders have limited insight into their offences which bears upon the question of contrition and remorse. I have set out at length, earlier in these reasons, my findings by reference to the evidence so that the Offenders and the community may understand what it is that they are being sentenced for. Dr Lennings observed that the Offenders, on 25 June 2009, “tell me they feel frustrated that they lost their child (Gloria) and they are being blamed for it, and they find that hard to bear, given their deep grief at the death of their daughter” (Dr Lennings’ report, 27 June 2009, page 2). On the totality of the evidence now adduced, I am satisfied that Manju Sam has developed some insight into the nature of her offence, but that Thomas Sam continues to see the blame for his daughter’s death lying with others. It is necessary that the sentences to be imposed make the Offenders accountable for their criminal conduct which led to Gloria’s death: s.3A(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    160 The sentences to be imposed must also denounce the conduct of the Offenders in failing grossly to take necessary and readily available action to treat Gloria’s curable condition (s.3A(f)) and must recognise the harm done to the victim, Gloria, and the community (s.3A(g)). 
     
      
    161 The sentences to be imposed must be seen to have a reasonable proportionality to the objective circumstances of the Offenders’ crimes. It is important for the Court to ensure that the subjective circumstances of the Offenders do not divert the Court from imposing sentences which adequately reflect the part which the law must play in upholding the protection of human life and punishing those who take it: R v MD (2005) 156 A Crim R 372 at [65].  
     
      
    162 In the course of submissions, I was referred to other sentencing decisions in cases of manslaughter by criminal negligence. Apart from statements of principle in these cases, I do not derive assistance from them in determination of sentence. Although there are different categories of manslaughter, there is no hierarchy of seriousness between different classes of manslaughter: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 381. It is not the variety of manslaughter, but the facts which determine the objective gravity of the offence: R v Dalley (2000) 115 A Crim R 582 at [64].  
     
      
    163 I accept the Crown submission that the offence of Thomas Sam lies at the higher end of the scale of seriousness for offences of manslaughter by criminal negligence. I accept that the objective seriousness of the offence of Manju Sam lies below that of her husband. In all the circumstances, a sentence of full-time imprisonment ought be imposed upon each Offender, with a shorter period of imprisonment to be imposed upon Manju Sam to reflect her lesser criminality.  
     
      
    164 I have taken into account all subjective factors in the determination of sentence, including the impact of imprisonment upon the Offender’s son. When considering the issue of “special circumstances” under s.44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the Court should not double count factors already taken into account: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18]. Accordingly, I make no finding of “special circumstances” with respect to each Offender. 
     
      
    165 Thomas Sam has been in custody for this offence since 2 July 2009, and I will direct that his sentence operate from that date. Manju Sam has been on bail at all times and her sentence should date from today. 
     
      
    166 Thomas Sam, for the offence of manslaughter of Gloria Mary Thomas, I sentence you to a non-parole period of six years to date from 2 July 2009 and to expire on 1 July 2015 with a balance of term of two years to commence on 2 July 2015 and to expire on 1 July 2017.  
     
      
    167 Manju Sam, for the manslaughter of Gloria Mary Thomas, I sentence you to a non-parole period of four years to date from 28 September 2009 and to expire on 27 September 2013 with a balance of term of one year and four months to commence on 28 September 2013 and to expire on 27 January 2015.

      10659/2009 Director-General, Department of Primary Industries v Peter Schembri 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Mr Peter Schembri has pleaded guilty to two offences under the Fisheries Management Act 1994 (“the Act”), for which the Court now proceeds to sentence him.  
     
      
    2 By summons filed 3 February 2009, Mr Schembri was charged by the Director-General, Department of Primary Industries, with breaches of the Act. In particular Mr Schembri was charged with a contravention of s 16(1) of the Act and a contravention of s 18(2) of the Act. The breaches concerned commercial fishing operations in which fish that were too small were caught and, quite separately, there were too many fish caught.  
     
      
    3 By s 16(1) of the Act, a person is prohibited from having fish of a measurement or weight prescribed in the regulations, in the person’s possession and, having possession of a prohibited size fish is an offence for which the maximum penalty is 500 penalty units in the case of a corporation and in the case of a natural person 100 penalty units or imprisonment for 3 months or both.  
     
      
    4 By s 18(2) of the Act, a person is prohibited from having in that person’s possession more than the possession limit of that fish. The possession limit is set by regulation and contravention of it is an offence for which the maximum penalty, in the case of a corporation, is 500 penalty units, or in the case of a natural person 100 penalty units or imprisonment for 3 months or both.  
     
      
    Facts 
     
      
    5 It is unnecessary to set out the facts, in full, nor is it relevant to the sentence how it was that Mr Schembri was apprehended. Some brief matters need to be stated. The offence in question occurred at Shellharbour. Officers of the Department of Primary Industries (“the Department”) received information as a result of which they attended at the premises of Mr Schembri and ultimately at the boat ramp and nearby car parks at Shellharbour. A Department sign is located near the ramp, which sign outlines the bag and size limits for all fish in New South Wales.  
     
      
    6 At the car park near or adjacent to the boat ramp, officers of the Department sighted a vehicle and trailer owned by Mr Schembri; they searched the nearby waterways but could not locate him. At approximately 1.00pm the officers departed from that location in order to check on some seemingly unrelated information received in relation to Bushrangers Bay. They were gone from the boat ramp area for approximately 15 minutes. On their return, the officers noted that the vehicle and trailer, owned by Mr Schembri, were no longer parked in the adjacent car park, but also noticed a water-trail mark, seemingly fresh, on the road commencing at the boat ramp and continuing along the road. The officers followed that water mark and noticed the vehicle and trailer owned by Mr Schembri. On this occasion there was a boat on the trailer, and the vehicle was travelling south along Shellharbour Road.  
     
      
    7 The officers pulled over the vehicle, utilising proper procedure, and, once they approached the vehicle, verbally identified themselves to the occupants and displayed their warrants. Mr Schembri, together with his companions Mr Camilleri and Mr Hay, had already alighted the vehicle. The defendant admitted that he had been fishing that day. He indicated to the officers that the catch was in “an orange icebox on board the boat”. An officer requested and obtained permission to climb on board the boat to inspect. Inside the orange icebox the officers found 28 sand flathead, all of legal length, and two squid. The officers unscrewed the floor of the vessel and found the well to be empty. Attached to the inside of the boat was a current Department Fisheries advisory sticker outlining bag and size limits for all fish in New South Wales.  
     
      
    8 The officers then inspected the front of the vessel and found lifejackets, tackle boxes and other fishing and safety gear at the bow of the boat below the dashboard. On moving this gear, officers found a green mat covering a piece of wood which was cut to match the shape of the boat’s bow. On inspection, officers found a large quantity of yellowtail kingfish. The fish were measured and counted. There were 46 yellowtail kingfish, ranging in size from 47.3cm to 60.0cm. The legal minimum prescribed length for yellowtail kingfish in New South Wales is 65.0cm.  
     
      
    9 Officer Corfield recorded Mr Schembri’s details from his driver’s licence and interviewed him about the matter. Mr Schembri conceded that he had caught some of the 46 yellowtail kingfish, that he had used handlines with bait, that he was the owner of the bait and that he had placed the kingfish in the bow as he knew that “they were below the legal minimum length of 65cm”. 
     
      
    10 Interviews were also conducted with Mr Camilleri and Mr Hay. None of the occupants of the motor vehicle, each of whom, on their admissions, had been fishing and had caught some of the yellowtail kingfish, had licences to possess that many fish or that sized fish. Mr Camilleri and Mr Hay all possessed current receipts for the recreational fishing fee for the relevant period.  
     
      
    11 Officers of the Department seized the vessel, fishing gear and 46 prohibited size yellowtail kingfish. The vessel and trailer were then, on a subsequent date, washed and cleaned. The vessel, trailer, motor and sounder were valued at $10,800, the valuation being tendered before the Court. A second valuation was obtained for the items which valued them at $11,000.  
     
      
    12 On 15 January 2009, a notice of seizure was sent to Mr Schembri and others.  
     
      
    13 The possession limit and daily limit for yellowtail kingfish in New South Wales is five per person and, as already noted, the prescribed minimum size limit for yellowtail kingfish in New South Wales is 65cm.  
     
      
    Consideration 
     
      
    14 Offences under the Act, in particular these offences, go to the protection of waterways and fish resources in the State. The offences with which Mr Schembri is charged are not at the lowest end of the scale. Nor are they at the highest end.  
     
      
    15 Some of the sizes of the fish are, to say the least, problematic and go to the nature of the offence under s 16. But the numbers of the fish are still relatively small. Effectively, between the three persons, there were three times the allowable number of fish that were caught. It seems, on the facts before me, that the offence is just below mid range in seriousness. Mr Schembri pleaded guilty at the earliest stage and is entitled to an appropriate discount. In accordance with the authorities, the range of a discount for a plea of guilty is between 10% and 25%. This plea was given at the earliest practicable time and I fix 25% as the appropriate discount for the early plea of guilty.  
     
      
    16 Mr Schembri was of some assistance to authorities by way of his statement and the admissions that he made to the Department Officers, both as to the ownership of the vehicles in question and his participation in the fishing exercise. That assistance is of some value, which I allow in fixing the sentence, but I do not separately identify or specify a percentage discount for that factor. A major issue between the parties on the sentence hearings was whether or not Mr Schembri was involved in commercial fishing activities. The Act deems a person to be engaged in commercial fishing activity when, amongst other things, that person is in possession of fish in excess of the quantity permitted.  
     
      
    17 Section 241 of the Act defines “commercial fishing activities” to mean fishing activities for commercial purposes and presumes a person to be engaged in commercial fishing activities (unless the person proves the contrary), if the person is in possession of a quantity of fish that exceeds the quantity of fish in excess of the quantity allowed: see s 241(2) of the Act. While Mr Schembri is required to prove, given the facts as I have found them, that he is not engaged in commercial fishing activities, that proof is required only on the balance of probabilities. On the other hand, the Department must prove those elements it is required to prove, beyond reasonable doubt. But the plea of guilty establishes to the requisite standard each of the elements of the charge, including, in this instance, that Mr Schembri was in possession of fish in excess of the permissible quantity.  
     
      
    18 The subjective circumstances of Mr Schembri can be briefly stated. He is a 57-year-old man, who has no previous conviction of any nature, including convictions in relation to these kind of offences. He is therefore entitled to the usual leniency exercised in relation to a first offender.  
     
      
    19 The question of whether Mr Schembri was engaged in the fishing activities in a commercial manner requires, for present purposes, more analysis than simply relying upon the deeming provision in the Act. While the deeming provision engages the criminal offences and is sufficient to render Mr Schembri susceptible to penalty, as if he were truly engaged in commercial activities, it is necessary to analyse whether Mr Schembri was engaged in commercial activities, within the ordinary meaning of that term, because it is a factor that informs the exercise of the sentencing discretion.  
     
      
    20 The Court is also required to take into account the provisions of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. If the motive for the offence were greed or commercial gain, then that is a factor in determining the culpability for the offence. Of course, the motive could be commercial gain without the fishing activity being commercial, in the sense that the Department suggests. For example, a person could offend the Act during the course of a commercial activity, being taking paying customers on a boating expedition to fish, rather than the sale of the fish that are then caught.  
     
      
    21 I reiterate that the Court is now dealing, not with the definition of commercial fishing for the purposes of the Act, but the circumstances of the offence for the purposes of determining relative culpability. Mr Schembri attests to the fact that he has, on prior occasions, breached the Act. He has not, previously, as I have already stated, been convicted of any such offence. Mr Schembri says that the fish that he caught on this occasion were for the purpose of personal use, including as a gift to his grandchildren, the oldest of which is 13. Those grandchildren live in Cowra.  
     
      
    22 There were 46 fish caught. Even giving Mr Schembri the benefit of accepting his evidence that the catch was to be divided three ways, he would have received, from the catch, 15 fish. Mr Schembri says that he was to drive from Shellharbour to Cowra, that afternoon, for the purpose of providing fish for his grandchildren to eat. I do not accept that explanation.  
     
      
    23 Nor do I accept the explanation that the false cover in the bow of the boat was for the purpose of hiding or storing equipment. Plainly, its purpose was to store fish, which it was illegal for Mr Schembri to possess. His conduct, on the day, including lying to officers of the Department, and seeking to hide the fish in the bow allows the drawing of the inference that such conduct was one at least of the purposes for which the cover was made. It was made, clearly, some time prior to the offence in question.  
     
      
    24 I consider that the fish were caught for a purpose other than the personal consumption of Mr Schembri and his family. The number of the fish and the steps taken to deceive the Department allow that inference to be drawn. Further, I consider that the offence was the result of a planned activity, in which Mr Schembri set out to catch kingfish and sought to facilitate the offence by the preplanning and building of a false cover for a well in which the fish could be stored. I also do not consider that Mr Schembri has displayed genuine contrition.  
     
      
    25 I turn then to the question of the sentence to be imposed. The legislature has fixed a maximum penalty which calculates at $11,000 or a prison sentence or both for each offence. The Department concedes, and quite properly so, that a custodial sentence is not appropriate in the circumstances of this case.  
     
      
    26 However, the legislature has fixed these offences for the purpose of ensuring the welfare of the State and in particular the continued population of the rivers by fish of various kinds. One of the difficulties in an offence of this kind is that breach of it is difficult to detect. No doubt most people who have ordinary conceptions of honesty and proper conduct and civic responsibility will comply with the Act. But those that do not seem to care very little about the prospect that, if everybody were to act as they wish to do, there would be no fishing left for the population to enjoy.  
     
      
    27 Such persons rely upon the difficulty in detecting the offence and it is necessary to fix a penalty that properly takes account of the principles of sentencing: deterrence, both general and specific; punishment; protection of society; retribution and reform. Each of these factors, particularly the protection of society, and deterrence and punishment must have regard to the gravity of the circumstances, viewed objectively within the range of conduct that may fall within the offence charged. Often the goals of sentencing seeks to resolve conflicting goals. On the one hand, there is punishment, deterrence and protection, and on the other hand, rehabilitation or reform. Much depends on the personal circumstances of the offender and the capacity for and likelihood of rehabilitation and the need for personal and general deterrence.  
     
      
    28 In this case, I must also take into account the principles relating to parity. A co-offender of Mr Schembri has been sentenced in the Local Court to a total fine of $1,500 (i.e. $750 for each offence). Further, the Department submits that I should make, in accordance with the Act, an order confiscating the property involved in the crime, namely the boat, motor, sounder and trailer. If I were minded to make such an order, then confiscation ought properly be taken into account as an additional “extra-curial”, or more accurately, “extra-criminal” punishment, which affects the sentence to be imposed under the charged offences. I consider, absent consideration of the effect of the confiscation order, that $750 fine for each offence is insufficient for the culpability involved in Mr Schembri’s conduct, and manifestly so.  
     
      
    29 In terms of relative culpability, Mr Schembri’s conduct is more culpable than this co-offenders. Not only did Mr Schembri provide the wherewithal to breach the Act (namely, the boat and equipment), but Mr Schembri was the one involved in the preplanning to which reference has already been made. Further, Mr Schembri understood that his conduct was illegal in the two major respects with which he has now been charged. Most importantly, it seems Mr Schembri was the principal offender; the ringleader, for want of a better term.  
     
      
    Confiscation Order 
     
      
    30 The Court has power and jurisdiction to order forfeiture of a boat and/or vehicle, in certain circumstances: see s 269(1) of the Act. A “trailer” is defined as a vehicle by s 4(1) of the Act: see s 4(1) of the Act, definition of “vehicle”. 
     
      
    31 “Boat” is defined in s 4(1) of the Act as meaning “any kind of vessel, however navigated”. The basis of the Department’s submission that s 4(1) defines “boat” to include “trailer”, is not clear. It would seem that “vessel”, where used in the definition, refers to a conveyance that is designed to travel on or under water, whereas vehicle refers to a conveyance on the road or in the air (i.e. not on or under water). Section 269(1) enables confiscation of a boat or motor vehicle. A “trailer” is not within the ordinary meaning of the term “motor vehicle”, which is undefined in the statute. However, by s 240(1) of the Act (a provision to which the Court was not taken by the parties), for the purpose of the confiscation provisions (and Part 9 generally), “boat” includes a trailer used to transport the boat.  
     
      
    32 The statute enables the Court to order forfeiture of a boat or motor vehicle that has been seized under Part 9 of the Act. Relevantly, that refers to a seizure, by a fisheries officer, of a boat or motor vehicle. That seizure may occur if the fisheries officer has “reason to believe [that the boat or motor vehicle] has been used … in commercial fishing activities for the purpose of committing a forfeiture offence.” (See s 265 of the Act.) Each of these offences is a “forfeiture offence”.  
     
      
    33 For the purpose of s 265 of the Act, Mr Schembri was engaged in commercial fishing activities: s 241(1) of the Act. Any activity involving the possession of fish in number in excess of that permitted is presumed to be a commercial fishing activity. A “fishing activity” is defined by s 4(1) of the Act as meaning: 
     
      
       
        
        “the activity of taking fish, including:  
         
        (a) searching for fish, or  
         
        (b) any activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the locating, aggregating or taking of fish, or  
         
        (c) carrying fish by boat from the place where they are taken to the place where they are to be landed.” 
        
       
      
    34 Further, s 240(2) of the Act defines “connected with a fisheries offence” as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) a thing with respect to which the offence has been committed, or  
         
        (b) a thing that will afford evidence of the commission of the offence, or  
         
        (c) a thing that was used, or is intended to be used, for the purpose of committing the offence.” 
        
       
      
    35 The definition of “fishing activity”, particularly subparagraph (c), indicates that transporting a boat to or from the water is not a fishing activity. A commercial fishing activity is a subset, or particular kind, of fishing activity. Thus, it would seem that transporting a boat to and from water is not a commercial fishing activity, because “fishing activities” cease at the point that the fish are landed.  
     
      
    36 The definition of “boat” in s 240 of the Act results in s 264 not applying to trailers. It would seem that transportation of the boat to and from the water would not be “connected with a fisheries offence”, but it is unnecessary for me to determine that issue. Section 265 allows a boat to be seized (see infra). At least arguably, a trailer could never be used by a person engaged in commercial fishing activities for the purposes of committing a forfeiture offence, unless a prepatory act is included in that term. However, if would be odd if a trailer were not able to be seized, yet a motor vehicle, a boat and all other equipment could be.  
     
      
    37 Whatever be the intention of the legislature in relation to trailers, the Court certainly has the capacity to order forfeiture of the boat, and the motor and sounder. In my view, the motor must be included in the meaning of the term “boat”, but if it were not, it could be seized under s 264 of the Act. The sounder, also, could be subject to seizure under s 264 and forfeiture under s 269 of the Act. Moreover, s 264 allows seizure in circumstances other than commercial fishing activities. There is no issue in these proceedings that the motor and sounder were used in the commission of the offences. The sounder was fitted to the boat [Affidavit of Peter Schembri of 18 March 2009, at paragraph 5], having been purchased for $5,000, and is now worth $500 [Annexure C to the Affidavit of Emma Corfield of 3 February 2009]. 
     
      
    38 I turn then to the exercise of the Court’s discretion. I take into account that this is the first offence but also that other uncharged offences have previously been committed. I adopt the discussion in the Court of Criminal Appeal and, particularly, with great respect, of Allen J with whom Hope JA and Studdert J agreed in R v Bolger (1989) 16 NSWLR 115 at 126 et seq. I take into account that the boat is ordinarily used for lawful activity, even if, occasionally, Mr Schembri uses it to transgress the law.  
     
      
    39 I also take account of the circumstances of this offence. Even if this were a commercial activity, it is not a major undertaking by a commercial enterprise. I am not entitled to take into account any factor that is not derived from the subject-matter, scope and purpose of the Act: Re Coldham; Ex parte Brideson [1989] HCA 2; (1989) 166 CLR 338 at 347.  
     
      
    40 The seriousness of the offence is a factor to which I have regard, as is the severity of the sentence I intend to impose insofar as it bears upon the hardship that Mr Schembri will suffer as a result.  
     
      
    41 Mr Schembri is 57 years of age. He fishes as a recreational pursuit for which he uses the boat. He is employed on a part-time basis as a truck driver. He is not otherwise known to law enforcement agencies.  
     
      
    42 In all the circumstances, I do not consider, for this offence, given its circumstances and that it is the first offence for which Mr Schembri is to be convicted, that Mr Schembri should have his boat or trailer forfeited. The sounder may be equipment that goes beyond mere “recreational fishing” but, as it is fitted to the boat, it should be treated the same way as the boat and, if it were separately subject to seizure under s 265, I would order its return and I will specifically include it in the reference to “boat” in the orders that will issue in this judgment. 
     
      
    Conclusion  
     
      
    43 I have already stated the matters of aggravation and that which I consider most relevant in the sentencing exercise. I do not consider that each offence is part of the one criminal act. Mr Schembri could have caught too many fish of a permissible size. Alternatively, he could have caught the prescribed number of undersized fish. While the act of fishing was the one course of conduct, for which some allowance in totality must be made, there was a known commission of two quite separate offences.  
     
      
    44 Further, I do not consider the co-offender’s fine of $1,500 to be confining. First, it was imposed in the Local Court. Second, Mr Schembri’s conduct was much more culpable.  
     
      
    45 Having taken account of all the factors, except the plea, I would fix a starting point for each offence at $4,000. I allow a 25% discount and take account of totality by fixing a fine of $2,500 for each offence.  
     
      
    46 I make clear, if not already obvious, that I consider such a fine necessary in part for punishment, but otherwise to take account of both specific and general deterrence. I also consider that a bond would be inappropriate.  
     
      
    47 Mr Schembri, I convict you of the following offences:That, on 6 January 2009, at Shellharbour in the State of New South Wales, you did have in your possession prohibited sized fish in contravention of s 16(1) of the Fisheries Management Act 1994. Further, that on 6 January 2009 at Shellharbour in the Sate of New South Wales you did have in your possession more than the possession limit of fish of a species defined in Division 3 of Part 2 of the Fisheries Management (General) Regulation 2002, namely, more than five yellowtail kingfish, in contravention of s 18(2) of the Fisheries Management Act 1994. In relation to each of the aforesaid offences, you are fined an amount of $2,500, being a total of $5,000 for both offences. AND THE COURT MAKES THE FOLLOWING FURTHER ORDERS: 
     
      
       
      (i) Pursuant to s 122 of the  
      Fines Act  
      1996, one-half of the amount of the aforesaid fines ($5,000), being an amount of $2,500, be paid to the Director-General, Department of Primary Industries.  
       
       
      (ii) To the extent necessary, the boat (Registration Number DR466N), including the sounder, and trailer (Registration Number S87267), seized by officers of the Department of Primary Industries from Mr Schembri, being property of Mr Schembri, be returned to Mr Schembri within 28 days from the date of this judgment.  
       
       
      (iii) The Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff’s costs of and incidental to these proceedings, as agreed or assessed.

      JUDGMENT - Re applications to discharge jury 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: There are two applications before the Court for discharge of the jury. The first is made by Ms Yehia of senior counsel for the accused Mr Hasan. That application is supported by all the other accused, except the accused Mr Elomar. The second application is made by Mr Lange on behalf of his client Khaled Cheikho.  
     
      
    2 The first application concerns a Four Corners program broadcast on ABC Television last night at about 8.30pm. It is a program that lasted some forty minutes. The program arose out of the conviction of three men by a British Court in connection with a plot to blow up a number of transatlantic airliners flying between London and the United States and Canada. Earlier, there had been media reports on Tuesday 8 September 2009 concerning the same topic. Indeed, this had led to an application by all the accused, again with the exception of Mr Elomar, to discharge the jury, based on that publicity. On 11 September 2009 I declined to discharge the jury on that basis and I gave reasons for my decision on Monday 21 September 2009 (see The Queen v Elomar [No 27]).  
     
      
    3 Ms Yehia, in her submissions today, referred to the earlier application and reminded the Court that it had essentially been based on five points which were described as being of striking similarity to features in the present trial. Ms Yehia argued that the Four Corners program now provided a further basis for a discharge. Counsel submitted that the program contained more detail of a prejudicial nature than had the previous publicity. Ms Yehia submitted that it was quite likely that at least one of the jurors would have seen the Four Corners program because it was a popular program, and it was broadcast in a major time slot.  
     
      
    4 Essentially, Ms Yehia submitted that there were four factual matters that were of this prejudicial kind. These were said to be matters over and above those referred to in the earlier discharge application. They were, firstly, that chemicals had been purchased in a false name ""to start a health store"". Secondly, a number of items of equipment were purchased that were similar to items that had been purchased in the present trial; for example, pipettes, flasks and glass containers. Thirdly, the program last night showed a suitcase being purchased and a spade, it being the suggestion that the suitcase containing items connected with terrorism were being buried somewhere in the woods. Fourthly, Ms Yehia referred to the fact that on one of the martyrdom videos shown on the Four Corners program one of the defendants in that trial had said ""as you bomb us, you will be bombed, as you kill us, you will be killed"". The quote is not precisely the same as, but is similar to a remark made by an Australian accented mujahid speaking on a video that was an exhibit in this trial. That exhibit was alleged by the Crown to have been commonly in the possession of a number of the accused.  
     
      
    5 Ms Yehia's submissions, therefore, were essentially two-fold. While counsel accepted that the program did not specifically relate to any person in this trial, it was nevertheless submitted that there comes a point where a similarity in a particular situation between the circumstances in one trial, if extensively publicised, will create real prejudice in another trial. Secondly, Ms Yehia submitted that we had now reached that point where, having regard to this program and the related publicity, there was a real risk of a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    6 I will turn next to consider Mr Lange's submissions. First of all, he supported Ms Yehia and made two points in that regard. Firstly, he said the phrase ""you bomb us etc"" was not only a phrase that appeared on the video, it had been referred to in the summing-up as it was part of the evidence. Indeed, Mr Lange said that one local press article had picked up the words in a report concerning the final phase of the trial. Mr Lange argued that this increased the likelihood of prejudice because of the similarity between the words appearing in the two trials.  
     
      
    7 Secondly, Mr Lange reminded the Court that the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Re K [2002] NSWCCA 374 had held that it would be an error of law for a judge, in considering whether to grant a stay, to consider only whether the matter of prejudice was directed specifically at the accused. Mr Lange submitted that there need not be a direct link between the trial where a stay is sought, and the trial or trials that have been extensively publicised.  
     
      
    8 The second aspect of Mr Lange's submissions on which he sought a discharge was based on quite discrete grounds. These arose from MFI 296. The first aspect was an online report associated with The Sydney Morning Herald dated 25 September 2009. This is headed ""Chilling Plot: Suspect Hit Beauty Stores For Bomb Supplies"". The article might be summarised by saying that it deals with an Afghan immigrant who had been arrested in the United States. The article suggests that he had received explosives training from al-Qaeda, and that he went from one beauty store to another buying large quantities of hydrogen peroxide and nail polish remover with a view to building bombs for attacks on US soil. The article further suggests that he had used a hotel room in Colorado to try to “cook up” explosives a few weeks before a trip to New York, and that bomb making instructions had been found on his computer hard drive. Apparently FBI explosive testing had found explosive residue in the vent above the stove in the unit. Authorities, according to the article, seized backpacks, mobile phones and a scale from a neighbourhood that the suspect visited.  
     
      
    9 Mr Lange, of course, acknowledged that there was no connection between the American arrest and the proceedings here. But he asked rhetorically whether this trial had now reached a point where publicity about related offending might be said to give rise to a real risk of prejudice. Secondly, Mr Lange also tendered a report, or a series of reports, concerning the sentencing of one Bilal Khazaal in the Supreme Court last Friday. This gentleman had been gaoled for a maximum of 12 years with a non-parole period of nine years for making a document connected with assistance in a terrorist act knowing of the connection. The document was described in the article as a 110-page book compiled in September 2003 entitled ""Provisions of the Rules of Jihad"" and published online in Arabic as ""a practical guide to achieving martyrdom"". Apparently, it contained advice about terrorist acts, such as exploding bombs, shooting down planes and assassinating people such as the former US President George W Bush.  
     
      
    10 Once again, Mr Lange did not submit that there was any connection between Bilal Khazaal and this trial. He pointed, however, to the fact that there was a connection in that, in at least one of the articles, there was an interview outside the court with Khazaal's lawyer, Adam Houda, who had said his client would appeal. Mr Lange's point was that Mr Houda gets a mention in the present trial not only as a solicitor involved for one of the accused but also for the fact that he is mentioned as co-author of a publication called ""ASIO, the Law and You"". There is also evidence that a number of the accused were spotted by surveillance outside his office in early November 2005, it being their apparent intention to get some legal advice of one kind or another from him.  
     
      
    11 So Mr Lange's essential submission, focusing once again on the American case, was that the mention of going to beauty stores to buy hydrogen peroxide and nail polish remover, the use of stolen credit cards to buy chemicals, seizure of backpacks, mobile phones, et cetera, that all this perhaps suggested that there might be a worldwide manual available for use by terrorists. Mr Lange argued this fuelled the flames of prejudice in the present trial.  
     
      
    12 The Crown opposed each of the applications for discharge. Mr Maidment SC, who presented the Crown arguments, accepted that there does not necessarily have to be a direct link between publicity and persons in a particular trial, but he submitted, nevertheless, there would have to be a wholly exceptional set of circumstances for that type of publicity to result in a discharge. Mr Maidment submitted that the publicity during this long trial about terrorist matters of one kind or another, culminating in the Four Corners program, did not meet the stipulated test of necessity. Further, he submitted that it was hardly surprising that you see some similarities between allegations made in this case and those appearing in terrorist matters overseas since there is so much material available on the Internet, which can be scrutinised by persons who may have an interest in extremist matters.  
     
      
    13 Counsel stressed that although similarities of that kind might emerge from one trial to another, it is necessary, nevertheless, to look at the issues that arise in this particular trial and to contrast those with the situation appearing in the London plot. Mr Maidment submitted, when that was done, that there was no warrant for discharging the jury.  
     
      
    14 The principles that are relevant to resolve applications such as those in the present matter were set out in my earlier decision to which I have made reference. (The Queen v Elomar [No 27] at paragraphs 18 through to 26 inclusive). I will for completeness repeat them in this decision 
     
      
       
       
      Principles to be applied on the application 
       
      
    15 There is no dispute between the parties as to the principles applicable in the present situation. It is fundamental to our system of criminal justice that a person should not be convicted of an offence save after a fair hearing according to law (Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 293, 362 per Gaudron J). Although the Court should be slow to stay proceedings or to discharge a jury, in an appropriate case, the Court should not refrain from taking either step (R v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592, 623 per Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ; see also the Victorian Court of Appeal judgment upholding the trial judge's order restraining publication of the television series ""Underbelly"": General Television Corporation Pty Limited v DPP [2008] VSCA 103.  
     
      
    16 It is not necessary for the accused, in a discharge application, to demonstrate that he or she would not have a fair trial. It is sufficient if there is a real risk of prejudice if the trial were to continue (Re K (2002) NSWCCA 374 at (9)(10) per Beazley JA, Sully and Simpson JJ). In that case the Court found there had been “an unacceptable risk” (para 18) and that there would be a ""real risk"" if the trial were to proceed immediately following the pronouncement of the Court's decision. 
     
      
    17 Courts will assume that the jury, properly instructed, will accept and obey the directions of the trial judge to decide the case solely on the evidence placed before it during the trial. As Johnson J noted in R v Petroulias [No 19] BC200711115 at (40) - a judgment involving a stay application:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There is an increasing body of judicial opinion to the effect that whatever pre-trial publicity exists, jurors, when they take on the solemn responsibility of the performance of their duties in the courtroom, differentiate between gossip, rumour, news and opinion which they hear before the case and the evidence which they hear in the Court in the trial for which they are empanelled. A question remains in each case where the intensity, proximity and nature of the media coverage of the particular accused, or the particular circumstances, is such as to occasion the risk of unfairness to the accused so as to prejudice the accused's right to a fair trial for a time after the publicity. A judgment is called upon in each case having regard to the particular facts which are proved:  
        R v Yuill 
         (1993) 69 A Crim R 450 at 453-454."" 
        
       
      
    18 There is no doubt that similar considerations apply in an application such as the present, where the publicity is directed not to the actions of the accused, but where it relates to the activity of persons who have no connection whatsoever to the accused.  
     
      
    19 In R v Glennon, Mason CJ and Toohey J at 603 observed that the possibilities that a juror might acquire irrelevant or prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial, and continued:-  
     
      
       
        
        “The law acknowledges the existence of that possibility but proceeds on the footing that the jury, acting in conformity with the instructions given to them by the trial judge, will render a true verdict in accordance with the evidence. As Toohey J observed in  
        Hinch 
         (1987) 164 CLR at 74, in the past too little weight may have been given to the capacity of jurors to assess critically what they see and hear and their ability to reach their decisions by reference to the evidence before them.” 
        
       
      
    20 In John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v District Court of New South Wales (2004) 61 NSWLR 344, Spigelman CJ (Handley JA and M Campbell AJA agreeing) said at 366 (102-103):-  
     
      
       
        
        “As set out above his Honour expressed his concern that a future trial judge could not effectively ensure a fair trial by giving the jury directions, particularly as this may highlight the issues which establish the possibility of prejudice. In this regard, in my opinion, his Honour was proceeding on a basis which has, in recent years, come to be rejected by the Courts in relevantly analogous case law. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        There are now a significant number of cases in which the issue has arisen as to whether or not an accused was able to have a fair trial in the light of substantial media publicity, indeed publicity much more sensational and sustained than anything that occurred here. Those cases have decisively rejected the previous tendency to regard jurors as exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice. Trial judges of considerable experience have asserted, again and again, that jurors approach their task in accordance with the oath they take, that they listen to the directions they are given and implement them. In particular, that they listen to the direction that they are to determine guilt only on the evidence before them.” 
        
       
      
    21 (See also R v Jamal [2008] NSWCCA 177; [2008] 72 NSWLR 257) 
     
      
    22 The ""test of necessity"", accepted by the parties in the present matter as being applicable to the resolution of this application, was endorsed recently by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Crowther-Wilkinson (2004) NSWCCA 249. In that case two interlocutory judgments by the trial judge (Hidden J) had been published on the Court's website during the trial. The first was an application for a separate trial, and the second concerned the admissibility of a statement made to police. The Court determined that there had been no miscarriage of justice and that there was no warrant for the discharge of the jury. Included in the Court's reasoning was the fact that there was no evidence to suggest that any member of the jury had actually accessed the Internet to scrutinise the two judgments. Secondly, the jury had been given an instruction to consider the evidence impartially and rationally, and directed to make a decision based only on the evidence. Thirdly, the case against the appellant was absolutely compelling, such that his conviction would have been inevitable. 
     
      
    23 In the course of giving the leading judgment, Wood CJ at CL (with whom Dowd and Kirby JJ agreed) said at paras 203 to 208:- 
     
      
       
        
        “203 There have obviously been cases where it has been considered necessary to halt a trial mid stream, where that kind of publicity has been particularly prejudicial. The principle which has been established in relation to this kind of event and other prejudicial happenings, is one of necessity; that is, there has to be a “high degree of need”, in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice, before a discharge will be ordered:  
        Crofts v The Queen 
         (1986) 186 CLR 427 at 432. 
        
       
       
        
        204 In most instances, it has been accepted that sufficient directions can be given to overcome the problem, since it has been recognized that jurors can be trusted to obey the directions that they are given:  
        R v Bell  
        NSWCCA 
          
        8 October 1998,  
        Glennon v The Queen 
         (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 603,  
        Hinch v Attorney General 
          
        (Vic) (No. 2)  
        (1998) 164 CLR 15 at 74,  
        Murphy v The Queen 
         (1989) 167 CLR 94 at 99,  
        R v Yuill 
         (1993) 69 A Crim R 450 at 453/4, and  
        R v Loguancio 
         (2000) 1 VR 235 at para 24. 
        
       
       
        
        205 This is an important assumption, which underpins the retention of jury trials (see  
        R v Gilbert  
        (2000) 201 CLR 414 per McHugh J at para 31). I do not believe that it has been fatally flawed by the experience in the two recent cases decided in this State to which I will later refer ( 
        R v K 
         [2003] NSWCCA 401 and  
        R v Skaf 
         [2004] NSWCCA 37). 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        206 The authorities concerning prejudicial publicity tend to suggest moreover that the  
        mere possibility 
         of a juror having acquired prejudicial or extraneous knowledge, during a trial, is not normally a sufficient basis for concluding that the accused did not have a fair trial or that there was a miscarriage of justice. 
        
       
       
        
        207 For example, in  
        Glennon 
        , Mason CJ and Toohey J said at 603: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ’Likewise, the suggestion that there was a substantial risk that at least one juror would have acquired knowledge, before the verdict was given, of the respondent's prior conviction was again a matter of mere conjecture or speculation. The mere possibility that such knowledge may have been acquired by a juror during the trial is not a sufficient basis for concluding that the accused did not have a fair trial or that there was a miscarriage of justice. Something more must be shown. The possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant and prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
       
        
        208 In  
        Murphy v The Queen 
         (1989) 167 CLR 94, Mason CJ and Toohey J said at 99: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘…it is misleading to think that, because a juror has heard something of the circumstances giving rise to the trial, the accused has lost the opportunity of an indifferent jury. The matter was put this way by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R v Hubbert (1975) 29 CCC (2d) 279 at 291: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'In this era of rapid dissemination of news by the various media, it would be naive to think that in the case of a crime involving considerable notoriety, it would be possible to select 12 jurors who had not heard anything about the case. Prior information about a case, and even the holding of a tentative opinion about it, does not make partial a juror sworn to render a true verdict according to the evidence.'” 
          
         
        
       
       
      
    24 Crowther-Wilkinson, and a number of the authorities referred to in it, essentially deal with the situation where there has been prejudicial publicity concerning matters that were directly involved in the particular trial. Often this will take the form of sensational media reporting of the allegations against a particular person in relation to a serious crime at a time prior to the commencement of the trial. It may take the form of inaccurate reporting during the currency of the trial. In either case, the situation is somewhat different in the present application where the reporting essentially deals with a topic similar to that involved in the current trial, but is not suggested to be publicity about the accused themselves or their involvement in the crime with which they are charged. In any event, as I have said, the parties are in complete agreement as to the principles applicable to the resolution of the matter. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
        
       
      
    25 How then do these principles apply to each of the situations raised in the arguments? The first question is to consider whether any of the jurors would have been likely to have seen the Four Corners program or, for that matter, to have seen the material referred to by Mr Lange. As to the Four Corners program, there is no evidence before the Court that anyone has seen it. There is no evidence that the program was especially publicised in advance. The Four Corners program, although well known, was not shown on a major commercial channel. The program, it might be inferred, is aimed at a more select audience than perhaps many major timeslot programs on the commercial channels. Moreover, this was a specific program, it was not a news item; nor, so far as I have been able to ascertain, was the program reported in the media, either last night or today. As to Mr Lange’s report of the American arrest, it appears to have been a “one-off” and not featured elsewhere to any notable degree. On the assumption, however, that the material may have been viewed, it is necessary to consider the similarities that have been pointed to and to evaluate them in terms of their capacity to create potential prejudice.  
     
      
    26 In my earlier decision, I observed at paras 30 to 32 the following:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The first proposition is that although there are obvious similarities, there are major differences between the London plot and the allegations made in the present case. In the London situation, a group of Pakistani men, it appears, had determined upon a precise plot to bring down a number of transatlantic flights. The plan was so advanced that a test run had been undertaken, it seems, on a domestic flight. Further, the precise method of detonation of the explosives on the planes had been selected and thoroughly tested at ground level. By contrast, in the present trial, there is no suggestion that any of the accused had ever identified a target or targets. There is no mention of aeroplanes or of explosives in connection with any target whatsoever. There is no suggestion in the present trial that it had been determined who would carry out any proposed terrorist act or acts. The Crown case falls well short of suggesting that the accused, or any of them, were to be the bombers themselves. Certainly, the Crown case stops short of suggesting that any decision had been made that any of the accused would be the bombers and, as I have said, no target or targets had been selected. There was not the slightest suggestion in the present case, as I have said, that the ultimate aim of the collection of any chemicals or ammunition was the destruction and death of passengers on aeroplanes. 
        
       
       
        
        Another major difference is that, in the London trial, there was a video of one of the accused making plain his intentions that he was going to be involved in the death of innocent civilians. It was made plain that he would undertake this devastation because of the failure by America and its allies to heed Osama bin Laden's warning to leave Muslim lands. 
        
       
       
        
        Again, by way of contrast, in the present trial, there is no evidence, by way of TI or LD, to suggest that any of the accused themselves has been captured making what was called in the media reports ""a suicide video"". There is no discussion, as the defence have pointed out to the jury, which mentions a plan or proposal to bomb any target in Australia or overseas. There is indeed no direct reference to the offence alleged in the indictment.” 
        
       
      
    27 To those remarks, I would add these further points in light of the submissions which have specifically been placed before me today. First, there is no suggestion in the present trial that any accused here ever used or adopted the words ""you bomb us, so you will be bombed"", et cetera. The accused have conceded, or at least not disputed, that those words appeared in, or on, media in their possession, just as they have had to concede that they possessed images of the destruction of the Twin Towers or of Osama bin Laden in media in their possession. Some of the accused, indeed, had media containing images of the brutal execution of hostages by mujahideen. Their case in that regard, however, is that, firstly, everybody had these, they were simply handed out at the prayer hall. Secondly, there is no evidence that any of the accused actually viewed or discussed the material among themselves. Thirdly, there is no evidence they adopted any particular extremist points of view of the kind I have mentioned. This applies certainly to the catch phrase ""as you bomb us, you will be bombed"", et cetera.  
     
      
    28 The second point I would make is that the health store subterfuge referred to in the program concerning those involved in the London plot was plainly just that. It was a subterfuge. Here, the purchase of laboratory equipment is said to be genuinely for the purposes of a legitimate organics business already in operation. It was not a subterfuge. There is a powerful dispute concerning whether any of the accused in this trial ever acquired or attempted to acquire hydrogen peroxide. Moustafa Cheikho had bottles of the chemical at his home but an innocent explanation was given for this. Thirdly, there is no suggestion in the present trial that a steel suitcase was acquired or to be used to bury material although, admittedly, there is an issue about concealment of materials in the present trial.  
     
      
    29 Fourthly, the defendants in the London trial, or a number of them, according to the Four Corners program, conceded that they had made suicide videos but said that they did not intend to take lives, including their own. Their defence was that they were endeavouring simply to create mayhem and consternation among the public but nothing more. Their defence was that in truth no one was to be injured.  
     
      
    30 This situation contrasts very markedly with the present trial. It may be convenient if I quote once again from Elomar [No 27] at paragraph 33:- 
     
      
       
        
        The third and most important difference is that each of the accused has put a case to the jury in the present trial stressing that he was not a participant in any enterprise to undertake or do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. The defence case of each man is that, even if there were some type of criminal enterprise of the kind alleged by the Crown in the indictment, he, certainly, was not a party to such an enterprise. For example, the accused Hasan gave evidence before the jury that his ordering and/or collection of chemicals was undertaken innocently, at the behest of another man who he believed was endeavouring to raise money to send funds overseas to Muslim charities. Hasan's evidence was that his involvement in the ordering of laboratory equipment was to help another friend establish or enlarge an organic products business. None of the other accused gave evidence. But the case of Elomar, Jamal and Khaled Cheikho fastened, to one degree or another, upon the evidence given by Hasan. Moustafa Cheikho's case was simply that he had no involvement in any such criminal conspiracy. Each accused argued that the Crown had simply failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he was a participant in the alleged criminal conspiracy. The defence case was placed strongly and unequivocally before the jury in the closing submissions of all counsel. 
        
       
      
    31 Those observations have equal force in relation to each of the present applications. 
     
      
    32 Turning to Mr Lange's points, I would make these specific responses: First, the only point of similarity between this trial and the Khazaal trial was the report identifying Mr Houda as a solicitor in both matters. That point really leads nowhere in my opinion. The jury would well understand the necessarily independent status of solicitors, an independence entirely divorced from the guilt or innocence of their clients.  
     
      
    33 Secondly, as to the American article appearing on 25 September 2009, it simply does not advance the situation further and certainly not, in my view, to the extent argued by Mr Lange. Of course, as Mr Lange fairly conceded, the American arrests had no connection to the present trial but, secondly, they are, in my view, so divorced in content from the present trial that any publicity concerning them is likely to have had minimum impact, if any impact at all, on any juror who may have seen or read the article.  
     
      
    34 I accept that there are similarities, but the differences are important. The arrests relate to events on the other side of the world. They involve an Afghan man, who had been trained in explosives by al-Qaeda. They involve “cooking up” explosives in a hotel room. They involve the finding of explosive residue in that hotel room. None of that type of thing is involved here at all.  
     
      
    35 I accept, however, Mr Lange's submissions that the fact that potentially prejudicial publicity does not relate to a particular accused is not necessarily determinative of a discharge application. Ordinarily, it may well be determinative, but exceptional circumstances may dictate otherwise.  
     
      
    36 In Re K, which was an application for a stay, not a discharge application, the stay had been refused by the trial judge. The Court of Criminal Appeal, in a judgment delivered by the Court, held in the unusual circumstances of that matter that the trial judge had fallen into error. The nature of the problem appears from the judgment of the Court, in paragraphs 3 and 4:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Prior to the jury being empanelled the appellant made an application that the trial be vacated and that the proceedings be stayed temporarily. The basis of the application was that the appellant contended that because of the recent unprecedented publicity which had attended a series of trials and subsequent sentencing of a number of youths of Lebanese origin for sexual assaults upon young Anglo-Saxon females there was a risk of prejudice to him such that he may not have a fair trial. Three such trials had been held and were connected in that some of the accused were in two or more of the trials.  
        
       
      
      
       
        
        It followed on the appellant's submissions that it would not be in the interests of justice to proceed at this time. It was common ground that the allegations against the appellant are quite unrelated to the series of allegations which arose in the previous trials, however, the appellant identified a number of features that could, superficially at least, convey the impression that this trial was part of that series of connected trials.""  
        
       
       
      
    37 Later, their Honours said at paragraph 11, in identifying the error in the trial judge's approach:- 
     
      
       
        
        “While we would not have considered his Honour's statement as involving the taking into account of an irrelevant consideration, we do consider that his Honour erred in finding that it would be wrong to grant a stay unless the matter of prejudice was directed specifically at the accused. We are of the opinion that in circumstances where there has been extensive ventilation in the media of the backgrounds of a number of persons convicted for gang rapes in Sydney's west, a person of the same country of origin and the same religion charged with committing a like offence might in the minds of a jury be prejudiced.""  
        
       
      
    38 Finally, it is necessary to make reference to paragraph 18 of the decision where the Court explained why it proposed to grant a stay. The Court said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Although we have not found this matter to be without difficulty, we consider that the media coverage and the interest which has been exhibited by members of the public, both as to the trials to which we have referred and to the sentences imposed upon the convicted persons, has demonstrated such a degree of outrage in respect of the commission of such crimes that there are unacceptable risks to the holding of a fair trial that a person from the same country of origin, charged with having committed a like offence in the same part of Sydney, might be branded or seen, by reason of his racial origin and the nature of the offence, to be connected with those other offences.""  
        
       
      
    39 The extensive and unprecedented publicity referred to by the Court in that decision is at a very far remove from the facts in the present applications. 
     
      
    40 It is not insignificant, in my view, to note that the Court in Re K merely granted a stay for a very short period of time to enable those matters to become less intensely publicised by way of media focus. So, as I say, the stay that was granted, even in that exceptional case, was for quite a short period of time.  
     
      
    41 I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing in the Four Corners program, or in the articles handed to me by Mr Lange that would warrant a discharge of the jury. I am perfectly satisfied that there is no risk of an unfair trial in the present situation. The matters relied upon fall well short of the test of necessity. In addition, this jury has been instructed on a number of occasions to determine the issues in the trial solely on the basis of the evidence before them. The jury has been instructed to put out of its collective mind any publicity relating to any other terrorist trial or to events of a terrorist kind, whether occurring overseas or in Australia. As I said in an earlier judgment, it is my firm belief that the present jury is a jury that has taken all those instructions to heart.  
     
      
    42 I remain of the view that there is nothing in the program or the publications the subject of this application that will deter the jury from acting with complete integrity and honesty in accordance with the oath or affirmation each juror took when the jury was empanelled. I have no doubt that this material, even if it were seen or read, will be simply put to one side. Even as these reasons are being delivered, I have no doubt the jury is carefully considering the evidence in the trial, the submissions of counsel and the directions of law I have given. I am confident the jury will simply not allow any other matter to divert it from the carrying out of its duty fairly and impartially.  
     
      
    43 For these reasons, I decline to order a discharge of the jury on either of the suggested bases.

      Introduction 
       
       
      These are Crown appeals against sentences imposed upon the three respondents in the District Court which, for reasons of convenience, were heard together. Without intending any disrespect to them, I shall refer to each of the respondents by their surnames. Although each of these respondents was sentenced in respect of other offences as well, which appeared on a s 166 certificate, the appeal is confined to the sentences imposed upon each of them for the offence of escaping from lawful custody That offence, when dealt with on indictment, attracts a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.  
       
      
    3 The factual background to the matter, being uncontroversial, can be briefly stated. The three respondents were inmates at the Yetta Dhinnakkal Correctional Facility, which is located about 65 kilometres from Brewarrina. According to the sentencing judge it is set on about 10,000 hectares and has no security fence. Most of the inmates, like the respondents, are young Aboriginal men. His Honour observed, of the facility, that “[p]rison discipline is generally abandoned for a more therapeutic type of custody geared towards learning skills ranging from literacy, driving knowledge tests to driving farm equipment, fencing and the like”. 
     
      
    4 Shortly after 10pm on 2 November 2008 the three respondents left the facility in a utility which was owned by the Department of Corrective Services. They had obtained the key to the vehicle by breaking into a secured office and removing it from a locked cabinet. Police were notified when it was realised that the three respondents were missing. Police saw the stolen vehicle at about 10.45 pm but soon lost sight of it because of the prevailing weather conditions and the speed at which the vehicle was travelling. The vehicle was next seen about an hour later at Walgett where it was pursued and eventually stopped. The respondent Hookey was apprehended and returned to custody but the other two respondents managed to elude police. 
     
      
    5 At about 7 am on 4 November the respondents Cooper and Dates stole another vehicle from a property at Walgett. When it was seen by police about 45 minutes later it was pursued. During the pursuit, the vehicle in which the respondents were travelling reached excessive speeds even when it was passing through two small townships. On occasions it was observed to be travelling on the wrong side of the road. In due course the vehicle run out of fuel and the respondents were apprehended. The respondent Dates was in the driver’s seat whilst the respondent Cooper was occupying the passenger’s seat. The respondent Hookey had been at large for about 2 hours whilst the other two respondents had been at large for about 36 hours. 
     
      
       
      The sentences imposed at first instance 
       
       
      The respondent Cooper 
       
      
    6 At the time that he escaped from custody, this respondent was serving sentences for offences of assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which he had received an effective head sentence of 16 months. It consisted of a non-parole period of 12 months which commenced on 12 July 2008 and expired on 11 July 2009 with the balance of the term being 4 months which is due to expire on 11 November 2009. 
     
      
    7 In respect of the current matters, the respondent was sentenced to a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment for each of the two offences of being carried in a conveyance without consent (these offences related to the two stolen vehicles). Those sentences were ordered to be served concurrently and each was ordered to commence on 14 April 2009 and are thus due to expire on 13 October 2009. The maximum penalty for each of those offences is imprisonment for 2 years. It seems that the commencement date took into account the two days that the respondent had been at liberty. An offence of entering enclosed lands, for which the maximum penalty was a fine of $550, was dealt with under the provisions of s 10A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In respect of the offence of escaping from lawful custody, the respondent was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, consisting of a non-parole period of 3 months which is due to commence on 14 October 2009 and which is due to expire on 13 January 2010, with the balance of the term being 9 months which is due to expire on 13 October 2010. 
     
      
       
      The respondent Dates 
       
      
    8 At the time that he escaped from custody, this respondent was serving sentences for driving offences, including two offences of driving whilst disqualified and two of driving recklessly. The effect of those sentences is that he was serving a total sentence of 18 months which commenced on 23 August 2008 and which is due to expire on 22 February 2010.  
     
      
    9 In respect of the offence of being carried in a conveyance without consent, (which was the first offence in time), he received a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment. That sentence is due to commence on 24 November 2009 and is due to expire on 23 May 2010. In respect of the offence of take and drive a conveyance, (which was the second offence in time), the respondent was sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 months which is due to commence on 24 November 2009 and which is due to expire on 23 May 2010. The balance of the term, being 1 month, is due to expire on 23 June 2010. A concurrent fixed term of 1 month for possessing a small amount of cannabis was imposed and the offence of entering enclosed lands was dealt with under the provisions of s 10A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In respect of offences of driving whilst disqualified and driving in a dangerous manner (which arose from his driving of the vehicle that was pursued by the police), the respondent was sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 months which is due to commence on 24 November 2009 and which is due to expire on 23 May 2010, with the balance of term being 3 months which is due to expire on 23 August 2010. Those sentences were ordered to be served concurrently with each other and with the sentences to which I have just referred. In respect of the offence of escaping from lawful custody, this respondent was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, consisting of a non-parole period of 3 months which is due to commence on 24 May 2010 and which is due to expire on 23 August 2010, with the balance of term being 9 months which is due to expire on 23 May 2011. 
     
      
       
      The respondent Hookey 
       
      
    10 At the time that he escaped from custody, this respondent was serving an effective head sentence of 3 years imprisonment for offences of aggravated break and enter with intent in company and steal from the person. It consisted of an effective non-parole period of 22 months, which was ordered to commence on 11 December 2007 and which is due to expire on 10 October 2009, with the balance of the term being 14 months which is due to expire on 10 December 2010.  
     
      
    11 In respect of the offence of being carried in a conveyance, this respondent received a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months which commenced on 11 June 2009 and which is due to expire on 10 December 2009. In respect of the offence of escaping from lawful custody, he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, consisting of a non-parole period of 3 months which is due to commence on 11 December 2009 and which is due to expire on 10 March 2010, with the balance of the term being a period of 8 months and 1 week which is due to expire on 17 November 2010. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
       
      The respondent Cooper 
       
      
    12 This respondent was 22 when he committed the offences in question. He was born in Shepparton, Victoria and is one of five children. His father left the family home when the respondent was 7 years old, as a result of which he and his mother and siblings moved to Redfern. He still enjoys their strong support. At the age of 13 he was introduced to alcohol and heroin. He continued to use heroin on a daily basis until he was 21. He has also regularly experienced alcohol induced blackouts after bouts of binge drinking. Since leaving school at 14 he has not acquired any apparent vocational or work skills. He has a significant criminal history dating back to 2000 when he was dealt with in the Children’s Court for stealing from a person and other offences. He has since acquired convictions for offences of armed robbery, break, enter and steal and other offences of dishonesty, as well as for driving offences. He has also on several occasions breached parole. The sentencing judge estimated that he had spent nearly 60% of his 5 years as an adult in gaol. The sentencing judge could find little to suggest that the respondent was motivated to change his ways or that he had any insight into his offences. His Honour described his rehabilitation prospects as appearing to be “bleak”. 
     
      
       
      The respondent Dates 
       
      
    13 He is the youngest of the respondents, being 18 at the time of the offences. He was raised in Raymond Terrace. His parents separated when he was four and his mother then remarried. His step-father allegedly abused the respondent as well as his mother and one of his brothers. The respondent left home when he was 16 having completed Year 10 and having obtained certificates in bricklaying, hospitality and land management. However he has acquired no other vocational skills and nor does he have a history of employment. The respondent began drinking alcohol at the age of 15. He reported that he resorted to binge drinking several times a month as well as consuming cannabis on a daily basis. This respondent also has an extensive criminal history which includes convictions for aggravated break and enter with intent, robbery in company, and numerous offences of break and enter. Although he has never held a licence, he also has a number of convictions for driving offences. He has a prior conviction for escaping from a juvenile detention centre and on one occasion he breached parole. Although he was found to lack insight into his offending behaviour, the sentencing judge appeared to accept that he was still affected by the authorities’ decision not to allow him to attend his father’s funeral which had taken place only shortly before he escaped from custody. His Honour acknowledged that he had strong family ties but described his rehabilitation prospects as “clouded”. 
     
      
       
      The respondent Hookey 
       
      
    14 This respondent was aged 21 at the time that he escaped from custody. He was raised in Parramatta. His parents separated when he was 8, primarily as a result of his father’s drug dependence and violence towards his mother. Nevertheless he continues to have a close and supportive relationship with her and his four siblings. This respondent was expelled from school when he was 14 and has no employment history. It was at that stage that he began using illicit drugs and he has continued to use heroin since then on a daily basis. His attendances at residential drug rehabilitation facilities have not proved to be successful. This respondent also has a lengthy criminal record. He has twice been sentenced to terms of imprisonment for offences of armed robbery. He also has several convictions for stealing from the person and other offences of dishonesty, as well for numerous offences of common assault. He also has a prior offence of escaping from lawful custody and has breached parole on two occasions. The sentencing judge found that the respondent had expressed remorse but described his prospects for rehabilitation as “clouded”. 
     
      
    15 Each of the respondents received a discount of 25% from the otherwise appropriate sentence to reflect the fact that he had pleaded guilty to the offences in the Local Court. The sentencing judge gave consideration to the question of parity. The slightly shorter overall sentence which was imposed upon the respondent Hookey was attributable to the fact that he was at large for a shorter period than the other two respondents. As best I can understand it, in respect of the offence of escaping from lawful custody, the sentencing judge determined on an overall starting point for his sentence of 15 months, as opposed to 16 months for the other two respondents, before in each case applying the 25% discount for the plea of guilty. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing remarks 
       
      
    16 In assessing the objective gravity of the offences, his Honour observed: 
     
      
       
        
        Escaping from Correctional Services custody is in essence an offence against the proper administration of criminal justice. To effect this escape damage, albeit minor damage, was done to government property. The mechanism used to achieve the escape namely, driving off in a motor vehicle, involved the commission of a further offence namely, riding in a stolen conveyance. 
        
       
       
        
        None of the prisoners was at large for any length of time, although both [Cooper] and Dates committed further offences whilst at liberty, including driving riding in a stolen conveyance, a theft of another motor vehicle and entering inclosed lands. 
        
       
       
        
        Escaping from minimum security is a selfish self-centred offence. It puts pressure on prison authorities to toughen up the admission criteria to minimum security centres and rehabilitation programs available to those minimum security centres. Escapes have created a new classification, E, for prisoners who have escaped which denies them access to therapeutic rehabilitation programs. Each of these offenders will now have his classification marked accordingly. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        No prison officer was personally confronted by any of the offenders to effect the escapes, nor was any other prisoner recruited for any purpose associated with the escape. The offence was committed whilst in company, that adds to the criminality in that potentially more resources would have been needed to find and capture the offenders, and police may well have regarded themselves as being at greater risk from three escapees than from one. 
        
       
       
        
        These escapes fall though towards the lower end of the range. Some upper adjustment of criminality will need to be made to the sentences of [Cooper] and Hookey for the extra time they were out of custody. There was further offending whilst they were out, but that has been separately charged. While there are s 166 certificates the sentence imposed in respect of the further offending will be concurrent, but the sentence for the escape must be cumulative to them. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        These are offences calling for deterrence. The incarcerated community takes a keen interest in sentences given for escape. It is important prisoners clearly understand any sentence given will be cumulative, not only upon existing non parole periods, but also upon any sentence given for offences committed whilst at large in the community. Parliament has prescribed this as a strong deterrent to would be escapees 
        
       
      
    17 His Honour also referred to the requirement that the focus in sentencing should be upon the protection of the community. He also concluded that the offence was not planned. His Honour also observed that none of the respondents had applied to go to the particular facility in question and that each found it very remote given that his family was in Sydney. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s submissions 
       
      
    18 The submissions advanced on behalf of the Crown were said to be equally applicable to each of the respondents. Nor was it suggested that there was any basis for differentiating between them. The Crown conceded that his Honour had not committed any specific error of fact or law. Moreover, it was also expressly acknowledged that “it was open to his Honour to characterise the offence as at the lower end of the scale of seriousness”. 
     
      
    19 The Crown in advancing the submission that the sentences were manifestly inadequate relied in particular upon two decisions of this court. In R v Thomson NSWCCA unrep’d 21 May 1986, Street CJ, with whom the other members of the court agreed, observed: 
     
      
       
        
        It is desirable in the view I take for this Court to make a general pronouncement upon the approach to be taken by criminal courts when sentencing for this offence and to provide some indication of the length of sentence that should be considered by sentencing judges. As has been stated the statutory maximum is seven years’ penal servitude. This places the offence within the moderately serious nature of crimes. 
        
       
       
        
        Plainly enough this legislative policy is justified by the necessity of a strong general deterrent to escaping. The condition of prisoners held in custodial institutions must inevitably be harsher if rigorous methods are necessary to preclude escapes. This Court many times has said that those who go to low security institutions and avail themselves of that low security in order to escape are placing in jeopardy such reforms in our penal system as can be implemented in low security institutions. The element of significant general deterrence plays an important part in the capacity of the State to continue with reforms in the physical circumstances under which prisoners are held in gaols. That consideration is to be kept very much to the forefront by sentencing judges. Sentences in the order of six to nine months whilst not necessarily erroneous are below the pattern ordinarily to be expected. Judges are not free to disregard the import of the legislature’s prescription of seven years at the maximum 
        
       
       
        
        The ordinarily level of sentence for what might be called an unremarkable escape could be expected to approximate two years. This ordinary expectation is to be recognised and observed by sentencing judges in order both to bring regularity into the treating by criminal courts of this offence and also in order to mark the importance of general deterrence. 
        
       
       
        
        I take the view that the sentence of two years in the present case was entirely appropriate. It represents the proper measure of sentence. In so saying I do not inhibit the ordinary range of discretion open to trial judges who either pass longer or shorter sentences should particular circumstances so require but the norm should be regarded as being in the order of two years. 
        
       
      
    20 In R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94, Wood CJ at CL, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        The offence of escape has been regarded by the courts as a serious offence, which potentially jeopardises the future of minimum security facilities and threatens the continued provision to prisoners of beneficial and humanitarian custodial arrangements and opportunities. It may lead to additional restrictions being placed upon their access to external medical treatment, and it may also impede the progress of rehabilitation for offenders with favourable prospects, if conditions of detention are strengthened, in order to prevent escapes.  
        
       
       
        
        These considerations were noted, for example, in  
        R v Thomson  
        NSWCCA 21 May 1986 where, in a case decided before enactment of the  
        Sentencing Act 
         1989, Street CJ observed that the ordinary sentence for an unremarkable escape “could be expected to approximate two years” (at a time when the maximum penalty for the offence was imprisonment for 7 years); and also in  
        R v Mathieson 
         [2002] NSWCCA 97 at [27].  
        
       
       
        
        Where the offender has remained at large for a very lengthy period or has used the opportunity of being at large to commit further offences, as was the case here, then the overall objective seriousness of his criminality is potentially increased:  
        R v Plummer 
         [2000] NSWCCA 363 at [34] and  
        R v Josef Regina 
         [2000] NSWCCA 100. The elements of both personal and general deterrence are also important, it being essential that prisoners understand that any offence of escape or attempted escape will result in a meaningful overall increase in their detention:  
        R v Butler  
        [2000] NSWCCA 525 at [18] and  
        R v Smith  
        [2004] NSWCCA 69. That this is so is also demonstrated by the fact that the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence has been increased from imprisonment for 7 years to imprisonment for 10 years.  
        
       
       
        
        It is also for that reason that the legislature enacted, by way of s 57(2) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
        1999, a requirement for sentences for escape to be served consecutively upon any existing sentence that has yet to expire, or upon any other sentence that is imposed in the same proceedings.(at paras 16-19) 
        
       
      
    21 The observations made in those decisions were referred to with approval in Arnaout v R [2008] NSWCCA 278.  
     
      
    22 As I understand the Crown’s submission, it was to the effect that as the present offences should be characterised as being “unremarkable”, the observations of Street CJ in Thomson (supra), that such an offence could ordinarily be expected to attract a sentence in the order of 2 years, had application. Accordingly, to impose head sentences of only half that length, particularly bearing in mind that the maximum penalty had increased in the interim, was said to be indicative of error. 
     
      
    23 The major focus of the complaint however concerned the length of the non-parole periods which had been imposed. It was submitted that no compelling reason had been advanced to justify why a period that represented only 25% of the head sentences had been fixed. 
     
      
       
      The respondents’ submissions 
       
      
    24 It was submitted on behalf of the respondents that, notwithstanding the well-recognised limitations of such material, statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission did not bear out the Crown’s contention that the sentences were manifestly inadequate. The statistics reveal 33 instances of the offence of escaping from lawful custody in the period from July 2001 to June 2008. 48% of those offenders received a head sentence of 12 months or less, whilst 47% of offenders received a non-parole period of 6 months (the statistics do not provide for periods of less than 6 months). Indeed, that material prompted the Crown, in written submissions, to candidly observe that “the statistics do not indicate that the principles identified in cases such as Thomson or Pham have been applied”. 
     
      
    25 The respondents also placed considerable emphasis upon two particular cases in which the observations in Thomson (supra) had been discussed. Attention was drawn to this court’s decision in R v Robinson [2000] NSWCCA 182, in which a Crown appeal against the asserted inadequacy of a fixed term of 6 months which had been imposed for escaping from lawful custody, was dismissed. Foster AJA, with whom Priestley JA and Smart AJ agreed, observed that: 
     
      
       
        
        In  
        Reg. v Thomson 
        , (CCA, unreported 21 May 1986), Street CJ said:  
         
          
          ""The ordinary level of sentence for what might be called an unremarkable escape could be expected to approximate two years."" 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        His Honour had previously indicated that:  
         
          
          ""sentences in the order of six to nine months, whilst not necessarily erroneous, are below the pattern ordinarily to be expected. Judges are not free to disregard the impost of the legislature's prescription of seven years as the maximum. "" 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        It must be noted that, since this decision was given, the statutory maximum sentence has been increased to ten years. However, it should also be noted that in  
        Thomson 
        , a non-parole period of a little under fourteen months was imposed in relation to the head sentence of two years.  
        
       
       
        
        I do not consider that  
        Thomson  
        can be regarded as laying down, as it were, a minimum tariff for sentences for escape. Later cases have taken this view. (See e.g.  
        Reg. v Machinroth 
        , CCA unreported 1998). Sentencing statistics placed before the Court indicate that, despite the statutory maximum, it is not unusual for sentences, as low as six months, to be imposed for this offence. There can be no doubt that a sentencing Court should not lose sight of the fact that a strong general deterrent is required to inhibit escape from Centres of Correction especially low security institutions, or from situations of low security (see  
        Thomson 
         and  
        Reg. v Ertl 
        , CCA unreported 7 May 1997). For my part, I consider that it would have been quite appropriate for a longer sentence to have been imposed in the present case. However, the question is whether her Honour's discretion miscarried in the relevant sense.  
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        I have come to the conclusion that, her Honour's sentence, although demonstrably low, was not so low as to warrant the intervention of this Court. (paras 26-29, 31) 
        
       
      
    26 In R v Horne [2004] NSWCCA 8 this Court also dismissed a Crown appeal against the asserted inadequacy of a sentence imposed in respect of an offence of escaping from lawful custody. Bell J, with whom other members of the court agreed, observed: 
     
      
       
        
        In  
        R v Robinson 
         [2000] NSWCCA 182 Foster AJA (with whom Priestley JA and Smart AJA agreed) observed that  
        Thomson 
         is not to be seen as providing a minimum tariff for the offence of escaping from lawful custody. A sentence of six months in that case was held not to be manifestly inadequate.  
        
       
       
        
        The sentence of eight months’ imprisonment imposed in this case was a lenient one. However, in light of the discussion in  
        Robinson 
         I am not persuaded that the Crown can succeed upon a challenge that it falls outside the range of sound discretion. (paras 37-38) 
        
       
      
    27 It was also submitted by the respondents that the criminality displayed in the present case being “at the lower end of the range” was, in any event, less serious than the circumstances which prevailed in Thomson where the offender had been at large for approximately 3 months. 
     
      
    28 As I said earlier, the Crown made particular complaint about the length of the non-parole period. In structuring the sentences as he did, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        In respect of Dates and Hookey the sentences they were serving appeared to be constructed so as to reflect a finding by the then sentencing judicial officer of special circumstances. That finding should be kept in place with subsequent cumulative sentences. In respect of all offenders the sentences are cumulative upon their existing sentences. To those existing sentences are added sentences for the 166 matters. It is important the overall sentences therefore be adjusted by use of special circumstances so at very least a “normal” ratio between the minimum term and the balance of term are preserved. Further, all offenders are young men who will have served extended periods in custody. 
        
       
       
        
        Courts are required for young offenders to give weighting to rehabilitation where appropriate. Each of these is desperate for rehabilitation. Each of these offender’s prospects at rehabilitation are at best clouded. …  
        
       
       
        
        Since each offender is to be sentenced for offences committed whilst out that will be cumulative to the escape sentence, weighting of the sentence for escape on account of offences being committed will be more muted than it would be before such a requirement was imposed. 
        
       
      
    29 The Crown was critical of that passage insofar as it appeared to suggest that his Honour regarded the need for rehabilitation as the paramount consideration in determining the length of the non-parole period. It was submitted that in doing so his Honour had been distracted from the fundamental task of determining “the length of the minimum period of actual incarceration”: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 [at para 57]. 
     
      
    30 For the respondents, it was argued that the primary basis for the finding of “special circumstances” arose however from the need to impose not one, but two sets of cumulative sentences. It is well recognised that such a consideration may of itself constitute “special circumstances”: see R v Close (1992) 65 A Crim R 55; R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58 and Clare v R (2008) 181 A Crim R 450.  
     
      
    31 Moreover, it was submitted that the sentencing judge was obliged in structuring the various sentences to bear in mind considerations of totality: see Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59; Pearce v The Queen (1988) 194 CLR 610; Johnson v the Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616. That required his Honour to consider not only the sentence to be imposed for the offence of escaping from lawful custody as well as the s166 offences, but also the sentences which the respondents had been serving at the time of their escape. In giving effect to the principles of totality, it was submitted that it was appropriate that his Honour should moderate the sentence for escaping from custody, particularly given that it was the last sentence in point of time to be imposed.  
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    32 The effect of what the sentencing judge did was to sentence each of the respondents, in respect of the escape offence and the other offences on the s 166 certificate, to an overall sentence of 18 months with a non-parole period of 9 months. Those sentences were made partly cumulative upon the sentences which the respondents were then serving. The net result is that the non-parole periods of the sentences imposed upon the respondents Cooper and Hookey were each extended by six months whilst the non-parole period for the respondent Dates was extended by five months. The finding of “special circumstances” means that each respondent will have a period of 9 months of supervised parole.  
     
      
    33 Viewed in isolation, the sentences which were imposed upon the respondents, and particularly the non-parole periods, appear to have been decidedly lenient. In making that assessment, I have had particular regard to the principles expressed in the various decisions about the potential jeopardy in which minimum security facilities are placed by those who escape from them. Moreover, given their appalling records, none of the respondents had made out a case for any particular leniency.  
     
      
    34 Nevertheless, I accept the submissions made on behalf of the respondents that it is neither possible, nor appropriate, to consider the sentences which were imposed for escaping from custody, in isolation from the sentences imposed for the s 166 matters and from the pre-existing sentences. In my view, the manner in which the sentences and particularly the non-parole periods were structured, merely reflected the obligation cast upon the sentencing judge to give effect to the principles of totality. Moreover, the Crown conceded that, even though the respondents’ prospects of rehabilitation were extremely limited, it was nonetheless within his Honour’s discretion to make a finding of “special circumstances”. Furthermore, in oral argument, the Crown submitted that the starting point for the non-parole periods, before the adjustment which was necessary to reflect the finding of “special circumstances”, should have been in the order of 9 months. However, once due allowance is made for that consideration, it is all but impossible, particularly in the context of a Crown appeal, for complaint to be made about the length of the non-parole period. Nor for that matter is the Crown’s argument assisted by either the Judicial Commission statistics or by the guidance provided by the decisions in Robinson and Horne (supra). 
     
      
    35 Given all those considerations, the Crown has failed, in my view, to demonstrate that the sentences about which complaint is made are manifestly inadequate. What I have said about the manner in which the sentences were structured has largely determined the fate of this appeal. In those circumstances, the sentences themselves can provide absolutely no guidance as to the appropriate level of sentencing for offences of this kind.

     Judgment 
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J. 
     
      
    2 R A HULME J: Darren Edward Wilkins (the applicant) pleaded guilty to an offence of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. This is an offence contrary to s 33(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 for which there is prescribed a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 also prescribes for it a standard non-parole period of 7 years.3 In being sentenced for that offence the applicant also asked that his guilt in respect of three further offences set out on a Form 1 document be taken into account. They were each offences of malicious damage by fire, contrary to s 195(1)(b) Crimes Act for which there is prescribed a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.4 On 24 September 2008 the applicant was sentence by his Honour Judge Coolahan (the judge) in the District Court to imprisonment for 11 ½ years with a non-parole period of 7 years. The sentence was specified to commence on 22 January 2007. The applicant will be eligible for release to parole on 21 January 2014.5 The judge also sentenced the applicant in respect of three related summary offences, being two of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order and one of having goods in custody. For these offences he received short concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment. This application is only concerned with the s 33 offence so the details of those matters may be disregarded.Facts6 The judge recited the facts of the offence at some length. It is convenient to adopt the summary contained in the Crown’s submissions: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 31 March 2006 Shereen Barker ended a relationship with the applicant which was of 10 years’ standing and had produced two children. Ms Baker commenced a relationship with Paul Martin just after mid April 2006. As at March 2006 Mr Martin had known both the offender and Ms Baker for about five years and had been a friend of both. Mr Martin resided at Kahibah. 
         
         
        On 12 May 2006 Ms Baker moved to Gateshead. On 4 July 2006 the applicant attended the home and an argument ensued. Police attended and directed the applicant to leave. On 20 July 2006 an apprehended domestic violence order was granted for the protection of Ms Baker. The order was made for a period of 6 months. 
         
         
        On 20 July, 5 October and 24 October 2006 the applicant breached the apprehended domestic violence order. On 1 December 2006 the breaches and a charge of common assault, where the victim of the assault was Ms Baker, were dealt with at the Belmont Local Court. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for concurrent fixed terms of one month to date from 25 October 2006. The apprehended domestic violence order was extended for 12 months. 
         
         
        On the afternoon of Sunday 14 January 2007 Ms Baker secured her Daewoo hatchback (valued at $4,000), in one of two garages (“garage 2”) located at Mr Martin’s property at Kahibah. Another garage (“garage 1”) was situated about 2 metres away. It housed two vintage vehicles: a 1931 model A Ford Tudor in original mint condition (and uninsured) and a 1942 World War II Ford Army jeep. The former was owned by Mr Martin and conservatively valued at $25,000. The World Ward II jeep was the property of Mr Martin’s brother David and was estimated to be worth between $10,000 and $15,000. 
         
         
        Mr Martin spent the evening of 15 January at Ms Baker’s home at Gateshead and David Martin stayed at the Kahibah property. Both its garages were locked. At about 3.40am on 16 January 2007 David Martin received a telephone call from the neighbour advising him that she had heard a bang come from one of the garages and could see smoke coming from it. Mr Martin range triple 0 and went outside, where he saw smoke and flames coming out of the roof of garage 1. The fire brigade arrived at 3.49am and extinguished the fire. Both vintage cars were extensively damaged. (Form 1 offence 1) 
         
         
        At 5.19am the fire brigade responded to a second fire at the Kahibah premises, in garage 2, but on their arrival found it was already extinguished. (Form 1 offence 2). Used matches were found on the roof of the vehicle and on the floor of the garage. A fire extinguisher near the vehicle had exploded, causing its fire retardant contents to spread and put out the fire. 
         
         
        A forensics police officer conducted an examination of the garages on 16 January 2007 and formed the opinion that both fires had been caused by human intervention. In the case of the first fire use had apparently been made of a hole in the wall to start the fire and, in the second, a louvre in the window had been removed and the flyscreen cut. 
         
         
        At about 10pm on 22 January 2007 Ms Baker was at her home with her two children and Mr Martin. Mr Martins’ Ford Falcon sedan was parked in the garage. After hearing a loud bang Mr Martin and Ms Baker went to the back of the house and turned on the flood lights. Mr Martin went outside and saw the applicant run from the area of the garage. Ms Baker rang “000”. 
         
         
        The applicant ran across the backyard and stopped near a trampoline then turned and ran towards Mr Martin. Mr Martin saw that the applicant had a hammer in his right hand and picked up a cricket bat lying nearby. The applicant raised the hammer as he approached Mr Martin who, fearing he would be struck with the hammer, swung the cricket bat and struck the applicant around the shoulder or head. The blow had no effect on the applicant and he grabbed Mr Martin and threw him to the ground. He then got on top of Mr Martin, kneed him in the chest and struck him numerous times to the head with the hammer. On a number of occasions Mr Martin grabbed the hammer but the applicant grabbed it back and continued to strike him. 
         
         
        A neighbour, Michael Hicks, saw the two men “wrestling” on the ground and heard one call out “Help me, help me, please someone help me”. Mr Hicks then sought out another neighbour, Luke Watson, for assistance and the two ran back to Ms Baker’s backyard. There they saw the applicant sitting on top of Mr Martin, holding the hammer in both hands, and striking him with full force. Mr Hicks saw at least three blows and heard the hammer strike Mr Martin’s head with a “thud” sound. Mr Watson made similar observations. Mr Hicks and Mr Watson “barged” the offender off Mr Martin, and “reefed” the hammer from the applicant’s grip. They caught the applicant as he tried to flee and detained him until police arrived. 
         
         
        The applicant and Mr Martin were conveyed to the John Hunter Hospital. The applicant had singed facial hair. He told the treating doctor that he had gone to his ex-partner’s house and blown up her new partner’s car using petrol (Form 1 offence 3). An examination of the vehicle in the garage revealed that the driver’s side passenger quarter window had been smashed and the entire rear section of the vehicle had been destroyed by fire. Examination detected “traces of a hydrocarbon fraction containing the middle and high boiling components of petrol”. 
         
         
        A number of foreign items were recovered from the backyard including a hammer, a torch, a set of bolt cutters, two Zenith brand padlocks which were of the exact type used to secure the garage and a 600ml bottle of Coke containing petrol. 
         
         
        Mr Martin was an inpatient at the John Hunter Hospital until 27 January 2007. He was found to have 4 lacerations over the scalp which were bone deep and required 30-40 stitches, a laceration to the left zygoma, a bruise over the left lower chest and a CT scan of the face demonstrated air in the right maxillary sinus indicative of a small blow out fracture of that sinus. There was also a fracture of the medial wall of the right orbit. 
        
       
      
    Subjective features7 The applicant was born in 1962 and so at the time of the offence he was aged 44. 8 He has a criminal history which comprises multiple offences of culpable driving for which he was imprisoned in 1988. There are then the matters referred to earlier for which he was imprisoned for one month in December 2006. 9 The applicant did not give evidence in the proceedings before the judge but tendered on his behalf was a report by Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, dated 13 July 2008. Included in the history the applicant gave to Dr Nielssen was that he had lived most of his life around the area of Charlestown. His early development was normal and he reported a happy childhood. He was educated to Year 10 and claimed to have been an above average student. He then completed an apprenticeship as an electrician but then was employed by his father who owned trucks and he remained in that employment until 2003. 10 He told Dr Nielssen that he one previous long term relationship that ended when he was aged about 30 from which there were no children. He did not report any conflict around the time of the cessation of that relationship. 11 The applicant told Dr Nielssen that he was very distressed when Ms Baker terminated their relationship in March 2006. After she had moved in with Mr Martin he became anxious that she would try to prevent him seeing their two children who would then have been aged around eight and five. It would seem on his account to Dr Nielssen that at least initially he had reasonable access to the children but as time went on this reduced and there were repeated arguments about breaches of agreements concerning custody and access concerning the children, and in relation to maintenance arrangements. The applicant also claimed that he became concerned about inappropriate behaviour on the part of Mr Martin towards his daughter who was the younger of the two children. He told Dr Nielssen that Ms Baker had successfully applied for an apprehended violence order against him after an argument. He claimed that she had assaulted him but that the police did not accept his version of events. He claimed to have been unjustly accused of other forms of harassment, including damage to cars and stealing clothes. He said that when he was charged with the three breaches of the AVO that led to his imprisonment it was in reality the result of Ms Baker being violent towards him and subsequently complaining to the police that he was in breach of the orders.12 The applicant told Dr Nielssen that upon his release from prison he resolved to keep away from Ms Baker. However he said that someone broke into his shed and stole some bicycle equipment and he was told by an acquaintance that he could find the missing equipment in Mr Martin’s shed. (One assumes that this was intended to be an explanation for his going to that place. It does not explain why he went to Ms Baker’s home on the night of 22 January 2007).13 The applicant claimed that around the time of the offences he was feeling very depressed and had felt so since Ms Baker moved out. He said that he had experienced difficulty sleeping and had lost 30 kilograms in weight over a period of six months. He said that following his arrest and going into custody he was still feeling depressed but had not received any psychiatric assistance nor had been prescribed any medication. He told Dr Nielssen that this depression had since resolved. 14 The applicant told Dr Nielssen that his main wish for the future was to see his children. He said that he hoped to learn from his mistakes and do things differently in the future. He claimed that he had been under pressure at the time of the offences and reacted the wrong way. He claimed that he now had insight and would not let the same thing happen again. 15 Based upon what he was told by the applicant, with some support by information provided by the applicant’s father, Dr Nielssen made a diagnosis of “adjustment disorder with depressed mood, now in remission”. The judge quoted from Dr Nielssen’s report in part as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “At the time of the offence Mr Wilkins was affected by an adjustment disorder, a clinically significant level of depression arising from a life event, in this case the breakdown of his relationship. The diagnosis was made on the basis of Mr Wilkins’ account of symptoms of depression, including weight loss, sleep disturbance and pervasively depressed mood after the breakdown of his relationship with Ms Baker, and the corroborative information provided by his father. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Mr Wilkins’ depressive illness is likely to have affected his judgment at the time of the offence and contributed to his inability to accept the change in his circumstances, deal with conflict in a more adaptive way or control his anger”. 
        
       
      
    16 In expressing his findings concerning the applicant’s subjective circumstances the judge said that he was not satisfied that he was a person of good character having regard to the apprehended violence order offences in 2006 and the offences he was required to take into account listed on the Form 1 document. However he did allow that up until those matters in 2006 the applicant “probably was a person of good character”. The judge said that he could not say that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend or that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. The basis for that was that there was no evidence upon which he could base any such findings apart, perhaps, for the opinion of Dr Nielssen that the applicant seemed to have come to terms with the break-up of his relationship. The judge was also uncertain as to the level of remorse demonstrated by the applicant. He noted in this regard that there was no evidence given by the applicant and also that his plea had been a late one. To reflect the utilitarian value of that plea, however, he indicated that he would allow a discount of 15%. The judge accepted a concession by the Crown prosecutor that there could be a finding of special circumstances “because of the offender’s need to deal with the problems regarding access to his children and the like.” The judge also took into account that this would be the applicant’s first significant full-time custodial sentence in more than twenty years”.Standard non-parole period17 Because a standard non-parole period is prescribed for the offence the judge was required to direct attention to whether that non-parole period should be imposed or whether there were reasons for departing from it. As to the objective seriousness of the offence the judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am of the view that the offence, objectively speaking, falls to be determined at the mid-range of seriousness. The unprovoked attack on a person by hitting him over the head with a hammer on numerous occasions must be regarded as extremely serious conduct indeed. Had more serious injuries been inflicted upon the victim, I would have thought that, objectively speaking, the offence fell to be determined at the upper range of seriousness. In this regard I have had some assistance from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        R v Mitchell; R v Gallagher 
         [2007] NSWCCA 296 where Howie J deals with the problems of assessment of the objective seriousness of offences under this section and where it seems to be made clear that the degree of harm will be, in part, determinative on that issue. Fortunately for Mr Martin his injuries and disabilities were not as great as one might expect from an attack such as this.” 
        
       
      
    18 After announcing the reasons for his finding of special circumstances the judge proceeded to say that there were reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period. He said that they involved, in particular, the offender’s plea and the finding of special circumstances. He noted, correctly with respect, that the standard non-parole period still had relevance as a reference point.Ground 1 The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to properly take into account the evidence of the applicant’s mental disorder in the determination of the sentence19 The judge noted that the applicant had not given evidence and then summarised the version he had given to Dr Nielssen as to factors that influenced his commission of the offences. The judge observed in relation to one specific aspect that it was not supported by independent evidence. He then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Indeed, in the absence of any evidence from the offender, it is difficult to be satisfied, and I could not be indeed, that his slant on the situation as set out in the history obtained by Dr Nielssen, was accurate.” 
        
       
      
    20 The judge then quoted the entirety of that part of the report that set out the “Opinion” of Dr Nielssen, including the passages I have earlier set out. The judge then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “So far as the opinions of Dr Nielssen are concerned, with due respect to him, as I say they are unsupported by evidence, particularly from the offender. In any event, this was the culmination of a protracted course of conduct on the part of the offender which started with the breaches of the apprehended violence orders and subsequent imprisonment in 2006 which should have been a significant warning for him at that stage and then leading up to the commission of the first of the Form One offences. In my view, whilst it may well have been the case that he was depressed at the time of the commission of the offence on the indictment, this should have little if any part to play in sentencing considerations. There is no evidence, in my view, which would support a conclusion that it was of such a degree as to deprive the offender of his ability to realise the serious nature of his actions which were, in respect of the Form One matters in particular, premeditated and without any excuse.” 
        
       
      
    21 It was submitted by Mr Dhanji that the judge accepted the opinion of Dr Nielssen that the applicant was depressed at the time of committing the offence on the indictment. Accordingly, it was submitted that the judge should have found that this reduced the applicant’s moral culpability for the offence, thus reducing the objective gravity of the offence. It was also submitted that this was a factor that warranted less weight to be given to the need for general deterrence. 22 These “errors” were likened to those which were found to have occurred in Benitez v R [2006] NSWCCA 21; (2006) 160 A Crim R 166. In that case the applicant had been sentenced for soliciting a person to murder his estranged wife and her new partner. The offences comprised a course of conduct over a period of eight months. An eminent psychiatrist expressed the opinion that the applicant had experienced depression following the breakdown of the marriage and that “his judgment and his actions in relation to the offending behaviour were significantly affected”. The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant was depressed but held that it was not a causative factor and so “the sentence does not reflect in any way the fact that he was depressed”. Simpson J referred to well known authorities on the subject: R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267, R v Letteri, unreported, NSWCCA 18 March 1992, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67, R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81, R v Champion (1992) 64 A Crim R 244 and R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48. She then stated: 
     
      
       
        
        [39] In my opinion it was an error for his Honour to direct himself in terms that suggested that the applicant’s depression, if not causative of his offences, was irrelevant to the sentencing process. The result was unduly to confine the sentencing discretion. There can be no doubt that he excluded it as a relevant sentencing factor; he said so explicitly. Applying the balancing considerations proposed by Gleeson CJ [in  
        Engert 
        ] to the present case, it can be seen, on the facts of this case as found by the sentencing judge, that protection of the community is not a consideration suggesting a greater rather than a lesser sentence. The finding concerning rehabilitation establishes so much. In my opinion the applicant was entitled to have his mental state taken into account as a relevant sentencing consideration, and one going to mitigation, not exacerbation, of sentence.  
         
         
        [40] That is so even if the finding of fact, that the depression had no causal connection with the offence, is accepted as correct. The correctness of the finding of fact was the basis of the first ground of appeal as pleaded and as originally argued. It is a finding of fact with which I have great difficulty. It is true that Dr Westmore accepted that it was difficult to make a retrospective diagnosis, but a fair reading of his report makes it quite clear that he did consider that the applicant was depressed; and the circumstances of the case are such that the depression arose directly from his matrimonial and family circumstances.  
         
         
        [41] But the influence of the depression must remain in perspective. In  
        Wright 
        , Hunt CJ at CL (as the presiding judge then was) said:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “But, if the offender acts with knowledge of what he is doing and with knowledge of the gravity of his actions, the moderation [in sentence] need not be great.” 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [42] Here, it must be accepted that the applicant, although acting out of depression, also acted with knowledge of what he was doing and of the gravity of his actions. That gives some guide to the extent to which his depression ought to have been taken into account in mitigation of sentence. In the circumstances of this terrible crime, it cannot weigh too heavily. 
        
       
      
    23 The Crown submitted that the judge was not bound to accept the diagnosis of Dr Nielssen and that this was so regardless of whether the Crown Prosecutor took issue with it or not. It was contended that the decisions of this Court in Sayin v R [2008] NSWCCA 307 and CAR v R [2009] NSWCCA 138 lent support to the submission.24 Mr Dhanji’s submission depends upon an interpretation of the judge’s remarks that I do not believe is warranted. It turns on the last two sentences of the passage set out above at [20] and requires an understanding that what the judge was saying was that the applicant’s depression should “have little if any part to play in sentencing considerations” because “there is no evidence ... which would support a conclusion that it was of such a degree as to deprive (him) of his ability to realise the serious nature of his actions”. The submission also depends upon an assumption that the judge was unaware of, or forgot about, the various ways in which a mental condition may be relevant to the sentencing exercise. Authorities, such as those referred to by Simpson J in Benitez, are frequently cited and are well known to criminal law practitioners and judges. The judge in this case has extensive experience in presiding over criminal cases. I would not readily interpret the judge’s remarks in the manner suggested. Nor would I readily assume the judge neglected to consider basic principles.25 A fair reading of the entirety of the judge’s remarks leads me to conclude that he was not convinced that the applicant was suffering from depression at the time of the offence because the opinion of Dr Nielssen was based upon matters not established in the evidence before him. The judge considered nevertheless, even if there was depression, whether it had any bearing upon the sentencing exercise and concluded that it did not. In the circumstances of the case this was a view that was open to his Honour. As Gleeson CJ stated in Engert (supra at 68) it is “erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances”.26 I would reject ground 1.Ground 2 The learned sentencing judge erred by failing to properly apply Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the standard non-parole period provisions) in sentencing the applicant27 In the written submissions there is reference to the judge having said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In sentencing for this offence, it must be borne in mind that the maximum penalty for it is 25 years imprisonment but the standard non-parole period is only seven years imprisonment”. 
        
       
      
    28 It was then submitted that the judge did not elaborate on the significance he gave to the standard non-parole period and that, in particular, he “did not refer to the fact that the standard non-parole period was of greater significance than the maximum penalty in a case such as the present”. Reference was made to some observations made in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [53] as to what was likely to happen in the future (the focus shifting more towards the standard non-parole period than the maximum penalty) and some remarks by Howie J in R v Mitchell; R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296 at [37] (that in a case that falls well above the mid-range of offending the standard non-parole period will have less significance as a guidepost and more attention should be directed to the maximum penalty). It was submitted that the judge in the present case “may have given excessive weight to the maximum penalty and failed to have proper regard to the (standard) non-parole period” because of the length of the sentence he imposed. This is how it was asserted that the judge had erred in the manner set out in the ground.29 In my view it is not possible to infer any error from the correct statement by the judge of the applicable maximum penalty and standard non-parole period. There is nothing in the judgment that indicates that the judge had too much regard for one as opposed to the other. The argument in support of this ground is really an attempt to divine some reason for the sentence being, as it is asserted under ground 4, “manifestly excessive”. No patent error is demonstrated under this ground which I would reject.Ground 3 His Honour erred in finding the offence to be “at the mid-range” of objective seriousness for the purposes of Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the standard non-parole period provisions) in sentencing the applicant30 Two errors were asserted by the applicant in support of this ground. The first is that dealt with in ground 1 that there was error in not finding the applicant’s moral culpability was reduced because of his mental condition. I have expressed my reasons for rejecting that contention. The second is that the offence is one of malicious wounding with intent, not malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm with intent, and, so it was submitted, it was erroneous for the judge to take into account injuries that were not woundings and were more serious than woundings: McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94 at [35] - [38]. 31 I accept that the judge took into account all of the physical injuries that were inflicted upon Mr Martin. He quoted from the statement of facts tendered by the Crown which set them all out.32 The judge later mentioned twice that it was fortunate that Mr Martin did not suffer far more serious injury. At no stage did the judge say anything to the effect that he was limited in the nature of the injuries that he could take into account because the charge averred wounding rather than grievous bodily harm.33 McCullough v R was a case concerned with an offence of malicious wounding, an offence contrary to s 35(1)(a). The applicant had inflicted a wound to the victim’s finger that required three sutures. There were also minor lacerations of the head that did not require suturing. The sentencing judge had also taken into account that the victim, who was a sixty year old woman, had sustained a fracture of the wrist and severe bruising around the eyes. She spent five days in hospital. Howie J said that the judge was entitled to take into account the nature of the assaults that gave rise to the wounding and also to take into account other injuries inflicted in the course of conduct resulting in the wounding that were less serious than the wounding. She was not, however, entitled to take into account other injuries that were not wounds and were more serious than wounds, specifically the fracture of the wrist, and nor was she entitled to take into account the hospitalisation of the victim because that was not identified as being a result of the wounding or the other injuries less serious than the wounding. The reason for this was that it was held that malicious wounding and malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm, although offences within the one section of the Crimes Act and carrying the same penalty, were distinct offences. The Crown submitted that the judge was entitled to take into account all of the injuries because to do so was not in breach of the De Simoni principle. However, Howie J held that it was impermissible to take into account more serious injuries that had been inflicted but for which the applicant had not been charged.34 The fact that McCullough v R was concerned with an offence against s 35(1) and the present case concerns an offence against s 33 is immaterial. The same reasoning applies equally to both. Howie J went on to observe that the two sections have been amended to remove the reference to “maliciously” and in s 35 there are now separate offences with different maximum penalties for reckless wounding and reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm. McCullough and the present case are concerned with the legislation prior to that amendment.35 It is true, of course, that this Court will not normally interfere with a sentencing judge’s findings in respect of the objective gravity of an offence: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 per Spigelman CJ at [37] and Simpson J at [46]. The applicant concedes that review of such a finding is limited and based upon the principles in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. I am satisfied that error of a House v The King type has been demonstrated. Taking into account the two facial fractures sustained by the victim was to take into account grievous bodily harm contrary to The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383.36 That leaves the question whether the offence should have been characterised as being in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The relevant matters to be considered include the following. The offence was not planned but was a spontaneous reaction upon being caught in the act of fleeing the scene of an offence of arson. The applicant, however, chose to run towards Mr Martin as opposed to running away from him. The applicant used a weapon in his attack. It is likely that the hammer was taken to the scene by the applicant to use in connection with the arson offence and not for the purpose of physically attacking anyone. He repeatedly struck Mr Martin and continued doing so even after Mr Martin managed to take hold of the hammer on a number of occasions. He chose to aim his blows to the head, a most vulnerable part of the body. Witnesses described a “thud sound” that accompanied each blow. Mr Martin sustained four lacerations over the scalp which were said to be “bone deep” and required some 30 to 40 sutures as well as a laceration to the left zygoma. The psychological impact of the offence upon Mr Martin, even putting aside the facial fractures, can be accepted as being significant.37 Consideration of the nature of the injuries inflicted by the commission of an offence against s 33 is an important aspect in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, although it needs to be borne in mind that the offence also involves an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm: R v Mitchell; R v Gallagher (supra) at [27]. An offence against s 33 can involve injuries ranging from a small laceration up to anything short of death. The lacerations in the present case were quite significant and the circumstances of the attack most violent. However I have come to the view that the offence fell below the middle of the range of seriousness for a s 33 offence, although not by a great margin. Ground 4 The sentence is, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive38 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that before the discount of 15% for the plea of guilty the judge must have had in mind a starting point for the total sentence of about 13½ years. Such a sentence would ordinarily involve a non-parole period in the order of 10 years, absent any “special circumstances”. A comparison was then made to the standard non-parole period of 7 years which the judge said he was not imposing because of the plea and his finding of special circumstances. It was submitted that the need to take into account the offences on the Form 1 document could not account for a starting point 3 years longer than the standard non-parole period.39 I am not convinced of the validity of this analysis but no determination is necessary. In finding that the offence fell below the middle of the range of objective seriousness it follows that I am also of the view that the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. The sentence should be quashed and the applicant re-sentenced. That finding, the discount for the plea, and the finding of special circumstances (which should be maintained), all point to the imposition of a non-parole period less than the standard. The need to take into account the offences on the Form 1 is a significant matter but not such as to elevate the non-parole period to one equal to the standard.40 I would take into account all of the subjective features of the applicant that were considered by the judge. It was submitted that if the Court did come to consider re-sentencing it should not maintain the finding of the judge that he was unable to find good prospects of rehabilitation. The judge’s reason for coming to that view was that, “There is simply no evidence on which to base any such findings, except perhaps for the opinion of Dr Nielssen that the offender now seems to have come to terms with the break up of his relationship”. This is one of the problems that arises when an offender does not give evidence in sentence proceedings. It was submitted that the inference that he has good prospects of rehabilitation should be drawn from the lack of relevant previous convictions prior to 2006, his age then being 43, and the offences being committed in the context of distress over the breakdown of a relationship. I am not persuaded that the applicant has discharged the onus which he bears of establishing this matter on the balance of probabilities. There was no evidence that he had undergone any programs, courses or counselling concerning relationships and anger management. It is difficult to forecast whether he would act differently in the future when under stress and in conflict with other people.41 In the sentence I propose I have taken into account the offences on the Form 1 document in the manner suggested by Spigelman CJ in Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146. They are serious offences in their own right involving substantial damage to property and were part of a campaign of revenge and harassment by the applicant towards his former partner and her new boyfriend.42 Taking account of all relevant matters I would regard a sentence of 10 years as an appropriate starting point before deducting 15% for the applicant’s plea of guilty. Against the resulting sentence of 8 years 6 months I would set a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months. Orders43 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1 Grant leave to appeal 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        2 Allow the appeal 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        3 Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        4 Re-sentence the applicant to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months with a balance of the term of the sentence of 3 years. The sentence will commence on 22 January 2007 and the applicant will be eligible for release on parole on the expiration of the non-parole period on 21 July 2012. The total term will expire on 21 July 2015.

    1 HODGSON JA: I agree with Fullerton J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: I agree with Fullerton J. 
     
      
    3 FULLERTON J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed after the applicant entered pleas of guilty in the District Court to two offences. The first alleged trafficking in a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, namely MDMA contrary to s 302.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (“the Commonwealth offence”) and the second knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of MDMA contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (“the State offence”).  
     
      
    4 The quantity of MDMA the subject of the Commonwealth offence involved the distribution of the drug in the form of 230,000 tablets. Under the Criminal Code the weight of a controlled drug is specified by reference to its purity. The gross weight of the tablets was calculated at 61 kilograms with a pure weight of 7.5 kilograms. A commercial quantity of MDMA is specified as 0.5 kilograms.  
     
      
    5 The quantity of MDMA the subject of the State offence involved an agreement to supply 10,000 tablets at an estimated gross weight of 2.26 kilograms or 666 grams pure. Under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act the weight of a prohibited drug is specified by reference to its gross weight. A large commercial quantity of MDMA is specified as 500 grams. 
     
      
    6 The Commonwealth offence was committed in May 2006. The drugs were imported from Canada to Australia concealed in computer monitors. The applicant was not alleged to have been involved in the importation or to have had any previous relationship with the members of the criminal syndicate who were responsible for the importation. The drugs the subject of this offence were not recovered.  
     
      
    7 The State offence was committed in September 2006. The drugs the subject of this offence related to a separate importation involving the same methodology and the same criminal syndicate. On this occasion the applicant had the expectation that there would be prohibited drugs imported by the syndicate, and that they would be made available to him for supply, having maintained a relationship with one of the importers over the intervening months. The drugs the subject of this offence were intercepted by the authorities before the supply could be effected. 8 Both offences attracted a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The State offence attracted a standard non-parole period of 15 years. Because the State offence was constituted by an agreement to supply the sentencing judge was satisfied that the level of objective seriousness was below the mid-range, albeit only by a small margin, which, together with the applicant’s plea of guilty and assistance accompanied by good prospects of rehabilitation, satisfied his Honour that the standard non-parole period would not be imposed but would operate as a guide to an appropriate sentence.  
     
      
    9 In the result, a sentence of 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years was imposed for the Commonwealth offence and a non-parole period of 7 years and 3 months with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months imposed for the State offence. His Honour did not vary the statutory ratio for the State offence, specified in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, being satisfied that the overall sentence resulted in an adequate period of supervision on parole. He did determine that there should be partial accumulation of the sentences to reflect the fact that there were two discrete episodes of offending separated by months, and further, that since the Commonwealth offence was objectively more serious, the sentence for the State offence (the offence committed second in time) should commence first. The sentence for the Commonwealth offence (the offence committed first in time) was ordered to commence two years into the sentence for State offence with the non-parole period expiring two years after the expiration of the non-parole period for that offence. This resulted in an overall sentence of 13 years with an effective non-parole period of 9 years, being 69 per cent of the overall sentence. His Honour made express reference to the sentencing practice of fixing the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period for Commonwealth offences between 60 per cent and 66 per cent. He took the view, however, that the ratio of 69 per cent in this case was a compromise between the state and federal sentencing regimes and that it also addressed the need for the effective non-parole period to bear an appropriate relationship to the objective gravity of the offending.  
     
      
    The grounds of appeal 
     
      
    10 The applicant advanced two grounds of appeal. The first concerned the question whether the sentencing judge made adequate allowance for what was described as “relative parity” with sentences imposed on Matthew Reed, a member of the international syndicate that imported the drugs the applicant was charged with trafficking and supplying. Reed was sentenced by Douglas J in the Supreme Court of Queensland in April 2007 on four counts of importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug contrary to the Criminal Code (Cth). Two counts involved cocaine, respectively 4 kilograms imported in May 2006 and 135.7 kilograms in September 2006 (neither of which attracted charges against the applicant) and two counts involved MDMA. The applicant was charged with trafficking the total quantity of MDMA that Reed was charged with importing in May 2006 and with agreeing to supply 2.26 kilograms of the 33 kilograms of MDMA he imported in September 2006. Reed was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years on each count.  
     
      
    11 The second ground of appeal concerned the ratio between the effective head sentence and non-parole period. It was submitted that the sentencing judge was in error in fixing the non-parole period at 69 per cent of the overall sentence in circumstances where the Commonwealth offence effectively subsumed the State offence and where the applicant’s subjective circumstances justified appointing a ratio at the bottom of what has been described as the Commonwealth norm. It was submitted that the applicant is entitled to be re-sentenced to correct this error even if the first ground of appeal fails.  
     
      
    12 It was submitted that if the first ground of appeal succeeds then, at the very least, the head sentence imposed in respect of the Commonwealth offence should be reduced. If the Court were persuaded that the applicant should be re-sentenced, the applicant advanced no submission as to how we should approach any re-sentencing for the State offence. The applicant did not challenge the order for partial accumulation, or sentencing for the two offences in reverse date order, it being assumed that the Commonwealth offence would subsume the State offence as the objectively more serious offence.  
     
      
    The facts upon which sentence was passed 13 The members of the syndicate that imported the drugs comprised four Canadian nationals: Handlen, Reed, Nerbas and Paddison. The drugs were shipped by sea in a container which had been packed with computer monitors some of which had their picture tube removed and into which the packages of drugs had been inserted prior to the computer monitor being resealed for shipping. Handlen had the leading role in the arrangements for both importations and was also responsible for the disposition of the drugs in Australia. Reed had some background in the business of recycling computer equipment in Canada. He was originally recruited to provide advice as to the suitability of the use of the computer equipment to secrete the drugs. Thereafter his role escalated to the point where Handlen was the only person senior to him.  
     
      
    14 Handlen and Reed came to Australia on 6 April 2006 to progress arrangements for the arrival of the drugs and to take possession of the drugs on their arrival. Nerbas was resident in Queensland during 2006 where he carried on an internet sales business. A company was incorporated in Queensland (RCC Pty Ltd) for the purposes of the importation with Reed and Nerbas as directors. The shipping container was consigned to that company. Reed and Nerbas also leased commercial office and storage premises in Brisbane. After the arrival of the container Reed, Handlen and Nerbas unloaded the computer monitors and stacked them in the storage unit. Within days the drugs (including the cocaine) were removed and stored in cardboard boxes inside the premises. 15 The following day what was referred to in the evidence as a “green Woolworth’s shopping bag” was packed with a number of packages of MDMA containing a total of 30,000 tablets which Handlen told Reed was to be given to someone who had come from Sydney to “get the samples”. The shopping bag was given to the applicant.  
     
      
    16 A few days later the balance of the MDMA, comprising 200,000 tablets, was packed into two duffel bags by Reed, Handlen and Nerbas and taken to Reed’s rented apartment. Handlen instructed Reed that the person who was to collect the bags had been provided with Reed’s telephone number to enable him to be directed to the apartment. The applicant telephoned Reed and obtained those directions. Later that evening, the two duffel bags were given to a young Asian man. Reed later confirmed with the applicant that the transfer had been effected.  
     
      
    17 The applicant told police in a record of interview upon his arrest that he collected all the drugs (or arranged for their collection) at the request of an acquaintance he knew only as “Peter”, who was in turn assisting a friend of his who did not understand English. He said that Peter told him that a Canadian might have some tablets the applicant could sell and that Peter expected a commission of 50 cents per tablet in addition to the tablets the applicant would collect for him if he was successful in selling them. The applicant said he was given Handlen’s telephone number, and later met with him in Brisbane, where he was offered the tablets for sale at an agreed price. Arrangements were made for the applicant to collect the Woolworth’s shopping bag and, a few days later, the two duffel bags. The applicant then returned to Sydney. He told police that he gave the tablets to someone else to sell and that this person accounted directly to Peter for the sale of Peter’s share of the consignment. After deducting Peter’s commission on his share of the tablets, the applicant said he owed Handlen $80,000. As Handlen was due to return to Canada he told the applicant to hold the money until either he or Reed asked for it. Some time later the applicant provided Reed with $50,000 at his request and the balance of what was owed was given to Handlen in September 2006.  
     
      
    18 On their return to Canada after the first importation Reed, Handlen and Paddison made arrangements to ship two further containers of used computer monitors to Australia. The first container was shipped without any drugs. Cocaine and MDMA were concealed in the second container in the same fashion as in the May importation.  
     
      
    19 Reed returned to Australia in August 2006 and resumed residence in Brisbane. Handlen and Paddison returned the following month. The applicant regularly socialised with Handlen pending the arrival of the shipment on 8 September 2006.  
     
      
    20 The Australian Customs Service intercepted the container and substituted an inert substance for the packages of drugs concealed in the monitors. When the container was unloaded it apparently became obvious to Reed and Paddison that there had been interference with its contents although it was not clear to them whether the drugs had been located. The applicant was recorded on several occasions speaking with Handlen in guarded and coded language concerning the anticipated availability of the container and distribution arrangements for the drugs. By the evening of 18 September 2006 they concluded that the authorities had inspected the container but had failed to locate the drugs. Handlen conveyed this to the applicant. Subsequent conversations revealed that the applicant was seeking confirmation that the consignment had cleared customs in order to proceed with some arrangements he had made with a third party. In his record of interview the applicant told police that Handlen had offered him 10,000 tablets to sell on condition that the proceeds of sale were available within a week.  
     
      
    21 The applicant was arrested on 20 September 2006. . His Honour’s findings  
     
      
    22 His Honour characterised the applicant’s criminality as constituted by the assistance he gave to members of an international drug importation syndicate whose objective was to introduce substantial quantities of dangerous drugs into the Australian community on two separate occasions. He also noted that the quantities of drugs the applicant dealt with were substantial in themselves notwithstanding the fact that they were part of a much larger consignment, that his sole motivation was a desire for financial gain and that his role in distributing the drugs was that of a principal. These findings are not challenged on appeal.  
     
      
    23 In so far as the applicant’s subjective circumstances were concerned his Honour noted that he was 64 years of age and had no prior convictions. His Honour took the applicant’s good character into account and was satisfied that because of his age, and the time he would spend in custody, he was unlikely to reoffend. Although his Honour had some express misgivings about the genuineness of the applicant’s remorse he accepted that the applicant regretted the impact of his conviction and sentence upon his wife and young children and other members of his family, some of whom have respectable careers. His Honour accepted the joint approach of prosecuting and defence counsel that the combined effect of the plea of guilty and past assistance justified a discount of 35 per cent. These findings are not challenged on appeal.  
     
      
    How his Honour dealt with the sentences imposed on Reed 24 The Crown provided his Honour with the published remarks of Douglas J in Reed’s sentence proceedings however, because of a sentencing practice in Queensland where details of assistance and discounts for assistance are suppressed from publication, neither defence counsel nor his Honour were aware of the precise discount that was applied to the Reed sentence or the reasons for it. Instead his Honour was informed by the prosecutor that Reed had been afforded the “maximum discount” for his past and future assistance. He accepted the Crown submission that because the applicant and Reed were not co-offenders (presumably because they were not charged with the same offences and were dealt with in different jurisdictions) parity considerations did not arise in what his Honour called “the direct sense”. Rather, his Honour was invited by the prosecutor to “bear in mind” the sentences that were imposed on Reed in imposing sentence on the applicant. He said that he would do so in his sentencing remarks.  
     
      
    25 This Court was provided with the published remarks in the Queensland sentence proceedings, inclusive of the in camera proceedings. Within days of the hearing of the appeal, the applicant’s counsel was also provided with the same material by order of the Supreme Court of Queensland on his undertaking that it would not be published otherwise than for the purposes of the appeal.  
     
      
    26 By reference to this material it is clear that Reed’s sentence was reduced by 50 per cent for his past and future assistance and, on one reading of Douglas J’s sentencing remarks, also by reason of his plea of guilty. When applied to a notional head sentence of 24 years on all four counts, the discount reduced the head sentence to 12 years on each count with a non-parole period of 8 years. The sentences were ordered to be served concurrently. In the applicant’s written submissions it was argued that his Honour may well have thought the discount was higher than 50 per cent, (presumably on the basis that that a 60 per cent discount on sentence has been nominated as ‘”the maximum discount”: see SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249) and that this may have impacted adversely on the applicant’s sentence because his Honour may have assumed a higher notional starting point for the calculation of the Reed sentence. After being given access to Douglas J’s reasons for judgment this submission was abandoned. 
     
      
    The first ground of appeal 
     
      
    27 The only remaining submission advanced in support of the first ground of appeal was that despite the fact that the Commonwealth laid different charges against the two offenders, the sentence imposed on the applicant did not bear a reasonable relationship or relativity to the sentence imposed on Reed. After making due allowance for differences in the sentencing practices in New South Wales and Queensland (the most significant being that Reed was sentenced to wholly concurrent terms of imprisonment for all offences, an approach which is contrary to established sentencing principles in this state for repeated offending of the type and scale in which Reed was involved), it was submitted that the sentences were nevertheless disproportionate. This conclusion was also said to be borne out by the fact that the objective criminality involved in Reed’s offending was much greater than that of the applicant and for two reasons. The first because of the senior role he played in both importations as compared with the applicant’s role in distributing, or agreeing to distribute, some of the drugs imported, and secondly because the drugs imported by Reed in September 2006 exceeded the drugs that the applicant was charged with supplying by a very considerable measure. It was submitted that to the extent that there are relevant differences in the subjective circumstances of both offenders this does not justify the applicant serving a significantly longer effective sentence. I note that Reed was a young man with no prior convictions and the applicant a very much older man also with no prior convictions.  
     
      
    28 The applicant submitted that it was immaterial for the purposes of the appeal whether this Court approaches the question of principle as one of “strict parity” or “relative parity”, assuming that there is a practical distinction between the two concepts. It was also submitted that irrespective of whether there is any difference in the approach to the sentencing of co-offenders mandated by Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 and the approach to the sentence of offenders involved in a course of criminal conduct in circumstances where, despite differences in the type or number of charges, different sentencing outcomes generate a justifiable sense of grievance, due proportion in the sentences of the applicant and Reed is required in order to reflect the principle of equal justice. The applicant relied upon Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 where at 301 Dawson and Gaudron JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        The parity principle upon which the argument in this Court was mainly based is an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated. On some occasions, different sentences may indicate that one or other of them is infected with error. Ordinarily, correction of the error will result in there being a due proportion between the sentences and there will then be equal justice. However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in  
        Lowe v The Queen 
        , recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to ""a justifiable sense of grievance"". If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options.  
        
       
      
    29 The Crown submitted that the lack of relativity in the sentences imposed on the applicant and Reed simply reflects the fact that they pleaded guilty to different offences and were sentenced on a different factual basis and that this approach was entirely in keeping with the line of authority most recently considered by Latham J in Pham v R [2009] NSWCCA 25 at [28] – [45]. The Crown submitted that the applicant was seeking to extend the application of the parity principle beyond that of co-offenders contrary to that same line of authority.  
     
      
    30 In Pham the applicant was convicted of knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine and was sentenced to a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months with a balance of sentence of 2 years and 6 months. His role was held to be significant although below that of others jointly involved in the importation and supply of the drug. While all offenders were originally charged with both importation and supply offences, not all offenders were arraigned on both charges. The importation offence carried a maximum of 5 years while the supply offence carried a maximum of life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 years. A co-offender, whose criminality was said to be far greater than that of the applicant, was sentenced only for the importation offence, the Crown having accepted that they should elect as to which charge to proceed with to avoid the indictment being stayed, and to a term of 2 years imprisonment that was then suspended under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Another offender was sentenced on both counts, no point having been taken in that sentence proceeding before a different judge that the indictment was duplicitous. That offender was sentenced to an effective non-parole period of 8 years. The applicant complained that his sentence on the supply count should be reduced in light of the sentences imposed on his co-offenders. He relied upon R v Kerr [2003] NSWCCA 234, a decision that addresses the application of the parity principle where co-offenders are charged with different offences. In Kerr Miles AJ, with whom the other members of the Court concurred, stated at [20]: 
     
      
       
        
        In other words when it is known that a person implicated in the offence for which an offender is being sentenced has already been convicted and sentenced, care needs to be taken to ensure that as far as possible the sentence about to be imposed is not so severe as to generate, not only a sense of grievance in the offender but also a sense of disquiet in the disinterested observer. The observer must of course be reasonably acquainted with the circumstances. Sometimes such a situation may be unavoidable. A co-offender may be given immunity in exchange for testifying against the accused. That does not in itself require leniency to be extended to the offender being sentenced let alone a sentence that is so lenient that it is out of the range of what is appropriate. 
         
          
         
        
       
      
    31 In dismissing the appeal Latham J considered the line of authority commencing with Kerr in some detail. After referring to the views of Miles AJ extracted above her Honour observed: 
     
      
       
        
        33 This statement of principle was considered by this Court in  
        R v Formosa 
         [2005] NSWCCA 363. There the applicant was charged with malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm in company. The co-offender, Wood, was dealt with as an accessory after the fact to the applicant’s offence. In dismissing the appeal, Simpson J stated:  
         
          
          40 The decision in  
          Kerr  
          is capable of being read as extending the principle so that it applies even where co-offenders are charged with different offences. I do not wish to be taken as entirely rejecting the proposition that the principle can be so applied, but here, with the extremely wide divergence between the nature of the crimes charged against the co-offender and against the applicant it is difficult, if not impossible, to see how that principle can be applied.  
           
          41 The effect of the submissions made on behalf of the applicant (and the decision in  
          Kerr 
           is at least capable of giving them some support) is that the principle of parity in sentencing is broad enough to extend to redressing disparities or discrepancies in the charging process as well as in the sentencing process.  
           
          42 In  
          Kerr 
          , there were marked parallels with the present case. The facts suggested that both the applicant and Oliver had been actively involved in the actual assault, and, so far as the facts are recited in the judgment, to a comparable degree. Yet Kerr was charged with a significantly more serious offence than was Oliver. Quite apart from any other differences, which were recognised in the passage quoted in  
          Postiglione 
           as justifying different sentences, that alone imposed demands upon each sentencing judge that were different. 
           
          43 In the present case the divergence was even greater. While Colin Wood does not appear actively to have participated in the assault, he was undoubtedly present for the purpose of supporting the applicant. That he was charged only with an accessorial offence is mysterious and unexplained.  
           
          44 I do not understand either  
          Lowe 
           or  
          Postiglione 
           to suggest that the parity principle extends to correcting any imbalance in the manner in which co-offenders are charged. I would be very cautious before proposing or adopting any such principle. 
           
          
         
        34 The statement of caution made by Simpson J above was repeated in  
        Spinks v R 
         [2007] NSWCCA 52 where a complaint of disparity was rejected in circumstances where one offender had been charged with less offences than the co-offender. The statement was also endorsed in  
        Yin v R 
         [2007] NSWCCA 350 at [23]–[24], in  
        Kauwenberghs v R 
         [2008] NSWCCA 98 at [109] and referred to in  
        McGuiness v R 
         [2008] NSWCCA 80. In the latter case there was no disparity arising where one offender had been dealt with summarily and the other on indictment. In  
        Yin 
         Barr J stated at [24]:  
         
          
          ……………….Although I express no opinion about the comparison of an appellant's sentence with that of an offender convicted of a more serious offence, it seems to me that comparison with that of an offender convicted of a less serious offence, as is done in this appeal, is attended with difficulty. 
           
          
         
        35 For completeness I note that  
        Kerr 
         was referred to in  
        Yassine v R 
         [2008] NSWCCA 139 and a small part of the judgment of Miles AJ quoted, but without critical comment. But the argument on parity failed and the appeal was dismissed. Similarly,  
        Formosa 
         and  
        Spinks 
         were referred to by Buddin J (Basten and Barr JJ agreeing) in  
        Holden v R 
         [2008] NSWCCA 100 at [38] with apparent approval and the appeal was dismissed.  
         
         
        36 In my opinion, if  
        Kerr 
         has any applicability, it must be in a very limited class of case. This Court is not generally concerned with addressing the consequences of prosecutorial discretion as it impacts upon the sentences imposed upon offenders. As Miles AJ recognised, it could not be seriously argued that a person should receive a reduction in sentence because a co-offender is not charged or where, for some reason, the charge does not proceed. Why then should a sentence be reduced because another offender is charged with a less serious offence or a lesser number of offences? How does the court inform itself of the reasons why the prosecutor acted as he or she did? Does the court interfere even if the prosecutor’s actions were completely justified?  
         
         
        37 If the disinterested observer is to be consulted then that observer should understand the reasons why the prosecutorial discretion was exercised as it was. If this observer also understands that the courts do not generally supervise the legitimate exercise of prosecutorial discretion or seek to address the results of its exercise, then the observer would feel no disquiet about the different sentencing outcomes. But if such disquiet does arise, it is a result of the prosecutor’s actions and not the sentences imposed by the court.  
         
         
        38 In my opinion there is no justifiable sense of grievance arising from the proceedings against [the applicant] or the sentence imposed upon him.  
        
       
      
    32 While it is true that the Commonwealth prosecuting authority in the present case laid different charges against Reed and the applicant (in part, it would seem, as a result of the fact that Reed was arrested in Queensland and the applicant in New South Wales) and that this had the effect of invoking different statutory sentencing regimes and different approaches of principle to the question of accumulation, the same statutory maximum of life imprisonment applied to all offences. In addition, it is important to emphasise that despite the differences in the objective criminality of the applicant and Reed the dominant offending of both was contrary to the Commonwealth Criminal Code, albeit that Reed was charged with importing the border controlled drug that the applicant was charged with trafficking there was a marked overlap and interconnection between their offending. In the particular circumstances of this case, to point to the different charges and the different State sentencing regimes as justifying the disproportion between the applicant’s sentence and Reed’s sentence understates the importance of the overriding principle of equal justice and its legitimate operation in this case.  
     
      
    33 Despite his Honour having said that he would “bear in mind” the sentences imposed on Reed, I am satisfied that a greater allowance ought to have been made for relative parity in sentencing the applicant particularly since it was not suggested to his Honour (and not submitted to this Court) that the sentences imposed on Reed were manifestly inadequate, despite the fact that the sentences are markedly out of step with sentences imposed in this state for importing commercial quantities of a border controlled drug (see R v To [2007] NSWCCA 200; 172 A Crim R 121 where Hulme and Hall JJ reviewed a number of recent sentences where commercial quantities of MDMA were imported and where significantly longer sentences were imposed). In circumstances where the Crown on the appeal does not advance a submission that the individual sentences imposed on Reed were manifestly inadequate, or that the overall sentence was extremely lenient given his repeated and serious offending over an extended period, it is not for this Court, of its own volition, to make such a finding and to refuse to intervene for that reason. 
     
      
    34 I am satisfied that the applicant has made out the first ground of appeal and that he should be re-sentenced. Accordingly, it is not necessary to decide whether, standing alone, the second ground of appeal would have warranted the applicant being re-sentenced.  
     
      
    Re-sentencing  
     
      
    35 The applicant submitted that this Court should approach the re-sentencing exercise by commencing to calculate the head sentence for the Commonwealth offence within the range of 15-17 years (the agreed range in the sentence proceedings) but less than the commencement point his Honour adopted of 17 years. After allowing 35 per cent for the applicant’s assistance and plea of guilty, the agreed range translates to a head sentence between 9 years and 9 months and 11 years. I am not satisfied that it is necessary to disturb the sentence imposed by the primary judge for a sentence in appropriate proportion to Reed’s sentence to result from the re-sentencing exercise. That can be achieved, in this case, by moderating the extent to which the two sentences are accumulated. The head sentence imposed by his Honour was not only within the agreed range but appropriately reflected both the seriousness of the applicant’s offending and the principle of general deterrence – a principle of fundamental importance when sentencing offenders who are involved in large scale drug trafficking. In addition, I am not persuaded that there is any need to re-sentence for the State offence, particularly having regard to fact that the non-parole period imposed by his Honour was half of the standard non-parole period of 15 years.  
     
      
    36 In order to achieve relativity with the Reed sentence I propose to ameliorate what was otherwise an appropriate degree of accumulation so that the sentence for the Commonwealth offence (the offence committed first in time) will commence six months after the commencement of the sentence for the State offence with the non-parole period expiring six months after the expiration of the non-parole period for that offence. This will result in an overall sentence of 11 years and 6 months with an effective non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months, being 65.2 per cent of the overall sentence. Although the ratio between the effective head sentence and the non-parole period slightly exceeds what has generally been considered appropriate where there has been an order for partial accumulation of Commonwealth and State offences (see Howie J, Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [36] - [39]) as his Honour emphasised at [40] this will not always be the case. In the particular circumstances of this case, were the generally accepted ratio of between 60 and 65 per cent to be applied the effective non-parole period would be an inadequate reflection of the objective gravity constituted by the applicant’s offending.  
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    37 The orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Leave to appeal is granted.  
         
         
        2. The appeal is allowed.  
         
         
        3. The sentence for the State offence is confirmed. 
         
         
        4. The sentence for the Commonwealth offence is quashed and in lieu the following sentence is imposed: 
         
          
          In respect of the offence of trafficking in a commercial quantity of 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years. The sentence is to date from 20 March 2007. The applicant will be eligible for release on parole on the expiry of the non-parole period on 19 March 2014.

      FACTS 
       
       
      The respondent stood trial for murder in the Supreme Court. On 4 May 2009, Rothman J directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty to murder, which was the charge on the indictment, and not guilty to manslaughter. 
       
       
      The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed against the directed verdict, pursuant to s 107 of the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act  
      2001. 
       
       
      HELD  
      (per Spigelman CJ, McClellan CJ at CL and R A Hulme J agreeing) 
       
       
      Question of law 
       
      1 The formulation ‘question of law alone’, in the context of s 107 in overturning a fundamental principle of criminal law, namely the principle of double jeopardy, indicates that an appeal on a mixed question of fact and law is not permitted under s 107: [24]–[25].

      3 It is not necessary to establish a precise act causing death in order to establish either murder or manslaughter: [46]–[49].

      4 Justice Rothman erred by proceeding on the basis that it was necessary for the Crown to identify a particular act of the accused which caused the injuries that led to death. This error raised a question of law alone: [59] [66]–[70] [72]. 
       
       
      Orders 
       
      5 Justice Rothman directed a verdict of acquittal on both murder and manslaughter. It is open to the Court to quash one or both of these verdicts under s 107(5): [82]. 
       
       
      6 The change brought around by s 107, namely, an abrogation of the double jeopardy principle, is a powerful consideration indicating that the Court was intended to be able to exercise its discretionary powers so as to minimise the injustice associated with a new trial after an acquittal. Even if there had not been a directed verdict on both murder and manslaughter, it would be open to the Court, pursuant to s 107(6), to order a new trial limited to manslaughter: [84].

      7 In an appeal against an acquittal by directed verdict, the Court should exercise its discretion not to order a new trial if it is satisfied that a conviction would be overturned as unreasonable, or on any other basis which would not result in a new trial on a successful conviction appeal: [90]. If the Court formed the opinion that an appeal from a new trial would be upheld, then that new trial would constitute a relevant abuse of process: [93]. 
       
       
        
        Maxwell v The Queen 
         (1995-1996) 184 CLR 501 considered. 
        
       
       
      8 In the present case, the Crown case for the mens rea element of murder is exceptionally weak. If the respondent were convicted of murder on a new trial, that conviction would be overturned as unreasonable on appeal; therefore, a new trial should be limited to a charge of manslaughter: [94]–[96]. 
       
       
      ORDERS 
       
       
      1 Affirm the acquittal on the charge of murder. 
       
       
      2 Quash the verdict of acquittal on the charge of manslaughter.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The respondent stood trial for murder in the Supreme Court. On 4 May 2009, Rothman J directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty to murder, which was the charge on the indictment. However, his Honour also directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty to manslaughter. Although the transcript records: “At His Honour’s Direction the Jury Returned a Verdict of Not Guilty”, his Honour expressly indicated he would pose both questions to the jury. 
     
      
    2 The Court has before it an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions against this directed verdict pursuant to s 107 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. By force of s 111(1)(b) of that Act, the publication of matters which may identify a person who has been acquitted is prohibited. 
     
      
    3 Section 107 is, relevantly, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) This section applies to an acquittal of a person: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) by a jury at the direction of the trial Judge, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) by a Judge of the Supreme Court or District Court in criminal proceedings for an indictable offence tried by the Judge without a jury, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) by the Supreme Court or the Land and Environment Court in its summary jurisdiction in any proceedings in which the Crown was a party. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any such acquittal on any ground that involves a question of law alone. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (5) The Court of Criminal Appeal may affirm or quash the acquittal appealed against. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) If the acquittal is quashed, the Court of Criminal Appeal may order a new trial in such manner as the Court thinks fit. For that purpose, the Court may (subject to the  
        Bail Act 1978 
        ) order the detention or return to custody of the accused person in connection with the new trial. 
        
       
       
        
        (7) If the acquittal is quashed, the Court of Criminal Appeal cannot proceed to convict or sentence the accused person for the offence charged nor direct the Court conducting the new trial to do so. 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
      
    4 The Notice of Appeal states that the Director appeals: 
     
      
       
        
        “ON GROUNDS involving the following questions of law alone: 
        
       
       
        
        1 Whether his Honour erred in finding that there was no case to answer. 
        
       
       
        
        2 Whether his Honour erred in applying the principles applicable to the direction of verdicts of acquittal to the present case. 
        
       
       
        
        3 Whether his Honour erred in finding that it was necessary for the Crown, in order to establish that there was a case to answer, to identify a particular act on the part of the accused bringing about the injury which caused the death of the deceased in order to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) establish the necessary intent for murder or manslaughter; and/or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) exclude all reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    5 With respect to Ground 3, Mr D Arnott SC, who appeared for the Crown, propounded in oral submissions a question of law as if the words “in order to”, where second appearing, and subpars (a) and (b) did not appear. The matters identified as (a) and (b) in the Ground as originally pleaded, he submitted, should be regarded as provided by way of particulars. Mr W Terracini SC, who appeared with Mr J Trevallion for the respondent, took no objection to this course. 
     
      
    6 Accordingly, Ground 3 is: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whether his Honour erred in finding that it was necessary for the Crown, in order to establish that there was a case to answer, to identify a particular act on the part of the accused bringing about the injury which caused the death of the deceased.” 
        
       
      
    7 The breadth of Ground 2 was also narrowed in oral submissions. Although accepting that his Honour correctly stated the relevant principles, Mr Arnott submitted that his Honour did not apply the principles applicable in a circumstantial case in two respects. Ground 2 is: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whether his Honour erred in applying the following principles applicable to the directions of verdicts of acquittal: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) That a circumstance cannot be rejected because it alone cannot lead to an inference of guilt.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) That the prosecution does not have to exclude a hypothesis consistent with innocence.”  
          
         
        
       
      
    8 As s 107(2) makes clear, the subject matter of the appeal is the acquittal. The “ground” which must be identified is the basis of the appeal. 
     
      
    9 Grounds 2 and 3, as reformulated at [6] and [7] above, allege ‘error’ in a common formulation for identifying a ground of appeal in this Court. (See R v JS [2007] NSWCCA 272; (2007) 175 A Crim R 108 at [76].) 
     
      
    10 The first issue in this case is whether Grounds 2 and 3, as reformulated, identify a “question of law alone”. 
     
      
       
      Question of Law 
       
      
    11 In my opinion, Ground 1 does not identify or particularise anything that could be described as a question of law. (See R v JS supra at [74]-[75].) In its submissions, the Crown did not attempt to articulate any question of law that was “involved” in any respects other than those already discussed in relation to Grounds 2 and 3. 
     
      
    12 Mr Arnott accepted that authority in this Court was to the effect that the formulation “question of law alone” did not permit an appeal on a mixed question of fact and law, referring to a number of cases, of which the most recent is Rasic v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12]. 
     
      
    13 Mr Terracini submitted that Grounds 2 and 3 involve a mixed question of law and fact.  
     
      
    14 In this respect I repeat my observations in R v JS supra where I said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[80] The Respondent submitted that the grounds in the proposed amended Notice of Appeal involved a mixed question of fact and law and were accordingly not ‘a question of law alone’ as established in  
        Williams v The Queen  
        (1986) 161 CLR 278 at 287, 301 and 314. The direction to the jury, the Appellant submitted, was based on the combined effect of her Honour’s interpretation and the absence of evidence as to the accused’s knowledge that any proceedings were federal judicial proceedings, within the definition of the  
        Crimes Act. 
        
       
       
        
        [81] The application of the reasoning in  
        Williams  
        supra, to the formulation in s 107 of the Act is by no means clear. The  
        Criminal Code 
         of Tasmania, which established the right of appeal from an acquittal under consideration in  
        Williams,  
        was different from the recent New South Wales statute. The Tasmanian provision referred to an appeal by leave ‘against an acquittal  
        on 
         a question of law alone’. The New South Wales provision is more expansive in its reference to ‘against any … acquittal on any ground that involves a question of law alone’. The reference to the ‘involvement’ of a ‘question of law alone’ in a ‘ground’ is wider than the use of the word ‘on’ in the Tasmanian statute.  
        
       
       
        
        [82] In any event,  
        Williams  
        is distinguishable. The issue there under consideration concerned the discretionary exclusion of evidence. That is quite different from what happened in the present case, which involved separate steps. The first was her Honour’s determination of the proper construction of the statutory offence. The second was her Honour’s determination, on that construction, that there was no evidence capable of supporting the charge. This was not a mixed question of fact and law. There was a question of law, followed by a question of mixed law and fact. 
        
       
       
        
        [83] The interpretation of the provision was the relevant, indeed determinative, step and that step does answer the description of a ‘question of law alone’. Accordingly, the words ‘such acquittal’ in s 107(2), which must be read relevantly as stating ‘acquittal by a jury at the direction of the trial judge’, did involve a question of law alone.” 
        
       
      
    15 With respect to Ground 2, there was nothing equivalent to a misinterpretation of a statute in the present case. Justice Rothman accurately set out the relevant principles for determining whether or not he should direct a verdict of acquittal. His Honour referred to relevant authorities including Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207, R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 and R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39. 
     
      
    16 Amongst the principles his Honour identified were: 
     
      
       
        the Crown case must be taken at its highest and it is for the jury, not the judge, to resolve conflicts of evidence ( 
       Doney; R v R 
       ); 
       
       
        it is not sufficient to find that a conviction would be unreasonable, within the statutory formula for criminal appeals found in s 6 of the  
       Criminal Appeal Act  
       1912 ( 
       R v R; Doney 
       ); and 
       
       
        it is not sufficient in a circumstantial case, as the case before his Honour was, for a trial judge to conclude that there was a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence ( 
       R v JMR 
       ). 
       
      
    17 No complaint is made by the Crown about his Honour’s statement of the applicable principles. The issue sought to be raised by the Crown on Ground 2 was whether or not he applied the principles.18 Mr Arnott directed attention to passages in his Honour’s reasoning in which he made references which, it was submitted, were inconsistent with the applicable principles. Particular reliance was placed on his Honour’s references to the evidence which suggested that the injuries may have been caused by a fall down the stairs. This was the alternative hypothesis consistent with innocence upon which the respondent relied at trial.  
     
      
    19 The issue for determination on Ground 2 is whether the ground involves a mixed question of law and fact.  
     
      
    20 The difference between the statutory formulation considered in Williams v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 278 and s 107(2), presently under consideration, was identified in R v JS at [81] as set out above. The formulation in Williams was “on a question of law alone”. Authorities in other statutory contexts indicate that this is narrower than a formulation with words such as “involving a question of law”. (See Brown v Repatriation Commission (1985) 7 FCR 302 at 303-304; XCO Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1971) 124 CLR 343 at 348; TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 82 ALR 175 at 178; B & L Linings Pty Ltd v Chief Commissioner of State Revenue [2008] NSWCA 187 at [47]-[55]; HIA Insurance Service Pty Ltd v Kostas [2009] NSWCA 292 at [84]-[85].) 
     
      
    21 As noted above, the Crown accepted that the different formulation in s 107(2) has the same effect as that which the High Court reached in Williams that is, that no appeal is permitted on a mixed question of law and fact. There is, indeed, Privy Council authority to that effect with respect to a statute which employed the same formulation as s 107(2). (Smith v The Queen [2000] 1 WLR 1644.) However, the statute in that case distinguished in express terms between the formulation “ground of appeal involving a question of law alone” and “ground of appeal which involves … a question of mixed law and fact”.  
     
      
    22 The same form of words does not necessarily have the same meaning in a different statute. The context is always important in statutory interpretation. (See HIA v Kostas supra at [21].) The Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act does draw the same distinction in s 53; however, that is concerned with a distinct regime of appeals from the Local Court to the Supreme Court. 
     
      
    23 This Court has applied the same reasoning as in Smith to the formulation “any ground which involves a question of law alone” in s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, permitting an appeal as of right. However, the immediate context in s 5(1)(b), like that in Smith, expressly refers to an appeal on a question of mixed law and fact which requires leave. (See Krishna v DPP (NSW) [2007] NSWCCA 318; (2007) 178 A Crim R 220 at [44]-[46]; Alramadan v DPP (NSW) [2007] NSWCCA 322 at [68]-[69]; Carlton v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 244 at [10]; Rasic v The Queen at [12].) 
     
      
    24 There is no reason to doubt that, in the context of a statute which overturns a fundamental principle of the criminal law like the principle against double jeopardy, the appeal should be similarly confined. Such expansiveness as may have been suggested by use of the word “involves” is counterbalanced by the word “alone”. The context of permitting an appeal from an acquittal is determinative. 
     
      
    25 The Crown concession was properly made and an appeal does not lie under s 107(2) on a mixed question of fact and law. 
     
      
    26 In my opinion, Ground 2 involves a mixed question of fact and law. Even if his Honour erred in applying the correctly stated principle, that process necessarily encompassed an assessment of the facts. The process of ‘applying’ a legal principle to the facts of a case involves a mixed question of fact and law which, the Crown accepts, is not within s 107(2).  
     
      
    27 The position with respect to Ground 3 is, however, different. As reformulated at [6] above, the ground identifies, most clearly by the word “necessary”, a legal requirement of any Crown case of homicide. That, in my opinion, involves “a question of law alone”. This states a legal proposition which is a distinct and separate step in the reasoning process. In the same way as the interpretation of a statutory provision considered in R v JS. This legal proposition is logically anterior to its application to the facts of a particular case. 
     
      
       
      Factual Background 
       
      
    28 The respondent was charged with the murder of his partner. They had been in a relationship for about three years.  
     
      
    29 His Honour summarised the facts, “taking the Crown case at its highest”, as follows (at [8]): 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) [PL] and the deceased were joint owners of their home worth about $600,000; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) They lived together since 2004, the property having been purchased from the assets of the deceased; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Each of [PL] and the deceased had partners prior to each other; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) On Good Friday, 6 April 2007, [PL] and the deceased had an argument, the subject matter of which is, according to the Crown, irrelevant, but concerned “a guy doing tiles”, after which [PL] stormed off;  
        
       
       
        
        (e) At some time on Saturday morning, 7 April 2007, the couple engaged in consensual sexual intercourse; 
        
       
       
        
        (f) During the course of the morning, [PL] made carrot juice for the deceased and/or himself; 
        
       
       
        
        (g) While [PL] was making the carrot juice, the deceased “kept at him”, they had a fight; 
        
       
       
        
        (h) Between 8.15am and 8.30am on 7 April 2007, there was a sound from the house, heard by the neighbour, like a shelf falling, pots clanging and lids rolling around the floor; 
        
       
       
        
        (i) The neighbour then heard the deceased singing (but I will assume, notwithstanding the evidence, a scream), there was then silence (said to be for about 10 minutes) and then the sound of [PL] wailing; 
        
       
       
        
        (j) At 9.00am a witness rang the home and [PL] was hysterical; 
        
       
       
        
        (k) When the first persons arrived at the scene, at about 9.15am, [PL] was seen wailing or crying hysterically, cradling the deceased’s head, rocking back and forward, his arms extremely tightly bound around the deceased’s neck and head. [PL] was in a state of total distress and was, as stated, totally hysterical; 
        
       
       
        
        (l) The deceased’s heart had stopped by the time ambulance officers arrived. Resuscitation was unsuccessfully attempted.” 
        
       
      
    30 His Honour also referred to fact there was a 57 minute gap between one witness hearing “crashing noises like a shelf falling” at 9.12am and the respondent calling 000: [9]. In that call, the respondent said, “I have a fight with my friend and my friend dead”. The Crown relied on this significant time gap.  
     
      
    31 The Crown relied on evidence that the relationship between the men had been deteriorating and that the deceased had expressed his intention to friends to end his relationship with the respondent. Furthermore, there is suggestion that the respondent would benefit financially from the deceased’s death. (The terrace in which they lived had been purchased by the deceased, but registered in both names.)  
     
      
    32 The Crown also relied on the fact that the respondent admitted on four occasions that he and the deceased were fighting. These occasions were the call to 000, to a constable at the scene, to his friend, and when interviewed at the police station. It also relied on the fact that on these occasions the respondent never provided an explanation for the deceased’s death. 
     
      
    33 There was some evidence of a fight in the house. The respondent was making carrot juice at some point in the morning, and the metal bowl of the juicer was found, apparently blood stained, near the deceased. This was a possible weapon. The deceased’s DNA was found on the spout of the juice extractor. There was evidence that the juicer bowl had been thrown at the wall in the kitchen, above the doorway, causing some damage. There were fine blood sprays around the staircase area and some blood smudges, although these may have been left by the paramedics. A detective at the scene thought he noticed blood on the handle of a cleaning brush in the kitchen. 
     
      
    34 The Crown also relied on evidence inconsistent with an alternative explanation that the deceased fell down the stairs, such as the fact that the deceased was still wearing slip-on backless slippers, which would be highly unlikely after such a fall (although it is possible that the respondent put them back on the deceased). The Crown submitted that the sounds heard by the neighbour were also inconsistent with that explanation and supported the hypothesis that there was a physical altercation. The medical evidence demonstrates that sustaining the particular injuries through a fall alone would be unusual.  
     
      
    35 The autopsy and forensic evidence was unable to definitely state the cause of death. It was not death by natural causes. There is medical consensus that death was caused by a blunt force injury/injuries to the head and/or neck area, perhaps a combination of the two. There was no consensus as to what may have caused those injuries. 
     
      
    36 The deceased had some lesions, scratches and bruises on his body (particularly the upper chest, neck and chin areas) each of which are partly or possibly compatible with the following propositions: 
     
      
       
        He was struck on the chin, and fell and hit his head on the floor. 
       
       
        A metal bowl may have caused the wound to the chin. 
       
       
        A metal bowl may have been used to create the blunt force injury to the deceased’s head.  
       
       
        He tripped and fell down stairs (but must have contacted protruding objects on the staircase to cause the injury pattern). 
       
       
        Some physical struggle occurred (the deceased had arm, hand and knuckle injuries); the respondent when inspected at the police station had evidence of a “chinese burn” on an arm. 
       
       
        One of these events caused the deceased to have a cardiac arrest (the autopsy showed poor health).  
       
       
        Manual strangulation was attempted, or significant force applied to his neck (though there was a lack of some physical indicators usually, but not always, associated with strangulation). 
       
       
        A combination of the above. 
       
      
    37 His Honour’s summary of the medical evidence commenced with the statement: “The medical evidence is at best ambivalent” (at [15]). His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[16] Dr Rodriguez testified to brain injuries suffered by the deceased, caused by blunt force injury, being a knock to the head either by the application of force to the head by a blunt object or the head hitting a hard object, e.g. a stair or a wall, etc.  
        
       
       
        
        [17] Dr Rodriguez accepted that the brain injuries, of themselves, would not necessarily cause death and ‘there is some doubt as to exactly why this person died at the time he did’, but considers there is a direct link to the blunt force injuries ... . If, he says, the injuries were to have caused severe diffuse axonal injury (DAI), then the deceased could not have cried out or sung. Further, Dr Rodriguez agrees ‘that the exact cause and mechanism of Mr Guzzetti’s death cannot be stated beyond reasonable medical doubt’. Dr Rodriguez was unable to say whether the deceased died from brain injuries.  
        
       
       
        
        [18] The blunt force injuries to the head could, Dr Rodriguez says, be caused by falling down some stairs. Dr Rodriguez deferred to Dr Botterill as to cause of death because he, Dr Rodriguez, was looking only at the brain and no other part of the body, and he may, in some cases, in determining cause of death, by a process of eliminating other causes, arrive at a conclusion that a seemingly minor, otherwise non-fatal injury, was the cause ... . 
        
       
       
        
        [19] I turn then to the evidence of Dr Botterill. He prepared a 13-page report which incorporated Dr Rodriguez’s findings. Dr Botterill concluded that the ‘direct cause of injury was blunt force head and neck injury’. He could not be certain whether it was a combination of the two or one or the other. ‘There was blunt force head injury and blunt force neck injury, both of which have the potential to result in death … [but he] … can’t say the relative contribution of both [sic: read each] but … [believed] … that it’s most likely that both together have resulted in the death’ ... . According to Dr Botterill’s report, the deceased was 71 years of age with no past medical history.” 
        
       
      
    38 His Honour then set out the injuries observable on the deceased and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “[22] Dr Botterill concluded:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Although any one of the individual injuries might be associated with a simple fall, the extent of distribution of the injuries is more in keeping with multiple blunt force injuries. It is possible that the neck bruising and chest injuries are related to application of force to the neck but discrete ligature marks or eyeball haemorrhages were not identified.’ … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [23] An explanation of the foregoing was given by Dr Botterill. A simple fall was explained as a fall in which the head was hit once. A complex fall (i.e. when the head was hit more than once) would include a fall down stairs. Strangulation usually causes burst blood vessels in the eyelids and eyeballs, which were not present. It is possible to have strangulation without them. Likewise, there was no fracture of the hyoid bone (which sits above the langio cartilages). Nor was there damage to the langio cartilages, to which damage occurs even more often in a strangulation.  
        
       
       
        
        [24] The head injuries are not inconsistent with being hit over the head with a blunt instrument. They are also not inconsistent with being hit on the chin by the juicer component, falling back and hitting the head. The head injuries are also not inconsistent with falling down the stairs.  
        
       
       
        
        [25] The bruising to the neck is not inconsistent with strangulation. Although, given the absence of petechial haemorrhages (the eyelids and eyeballs) and the absence of damage or fracture to the langio cartilages or the hyoid bone, it is an unusual strangulation, if it be one. It may be consistent with pressure on the carotid artery, at the battery point, causing the heart to slow and/or stop. The bruising to the neck is also not inconsistent with falling down stairs if there were protruding items into or onto which the deceased fell. However, as to the last-mentioned possibility, the injuries are remarkably widespread. Innocent possibilities would also include contact with the metal juice extractor, either at the bottom of the stairs or because the deceased was holding it and came in contact with it on the way down the stairs or at the bottom of the stairs. 
        
       
       
        
        [26] There are two extracts of Dr Botterill’s examination-in-chief that bear repeating. … [S]peaking of the neck injury, Dr Botterill says:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘These are in keeping with multiple blunt force contacts but I can’t say with certainty what the exact nature of those contacts were. There are a number of possibilities. It is possible that something such as the application of force from fingertips may result in that bruising. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          It is also possible that other types of blunt force contacts, bumping into various structures, might result in this distribution, although it is remarkably widespread. Blows to that area with some other object may result in these changes. It is also conceivable that some of these changes may be related to attempts at resuscitation … in a very inexpert way … although again that is completely the wrong place to be doing resuscitation. I think they are the range of explanations  
          but the truth is I can’t say which of those particular possibilities is the explanation for those bruises and surface marks 
          ’. (Emphasis added.)” 
          
         
        
       
      
    39 His Honour then referred to the evidence of Professor Hilton, called on the part of the respondent, but which, his Honour said, he would only rely upon insofar as such evidence could assist the Crown. His Honour said (at [30]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Professor Hilton had a different opinion on the cause of death and on the mechanism for death, or, more accurately, questioned the capacity to come to any conclusion beyond reasonable medical doubt. This material I do not consider in this application.” 
        
       
      
    40 As it plays a role in his Honour’s ultimate conclusion, I note that the phrase “mechanism of death” was adopted from Professor Hilton’s evidence. In cross-examination, he said: “The exact mechanism by which he died is obscure”. He was affirming the contents of a report he had written. 
     
      
    41 That report was put to the Crown expert neuropathologist, Dr Michael Rodriguez: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Professor Hilton continued, he says, ‘Therefore, there is some doubt as to the exact mechanism of death and its direct link to blunt force head injury’ do you agree with that statement? 
        
       
       
        
        A In part. ‘Exact mechanism’, yes, I agree there is some doubt as to exactly why this person died at the time he did. I think there’s certainly evidence there’s a direct link to the blunt force injuries that this person sustained.” 
        
       
      
    42 Justice Rothman set out other evidence by Professor Hilton: 
     
      
       
        
        “[31] However, other material was adduced, in a most effective cross-examination of Professor Hilton, as to the cause of the injuries to the neck, in particular. Indeed, the evidence of Professor Hilton on the cause of the injury is the best evidence the Crown has in the case. … [T]he following exchange between the Crown and Professor Hilton occurs. The Crown [referring to nine curvilinear abraded bruises to the chest and/or neck] asks Professor Hilton:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Q You agree that’s possibly signs of a struggle? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          A: I think they’re highly suggestive of there being a struggle. [Is it] … exclusive to that, no, but the distribution and number of them, yes, there could. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q: Before we were talking about manual strangulation and manual strangulation still plays a significant role in this matter; would you agree with that? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          A: Yes. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q: … manual strangulation requires the hands to go up around the neck area, would you agree with that? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          A: Manual strangulation implies the application of force to the neck by one or two hands, or, perhaps, in fact, … more … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q: So those marks on Mr Guzzetti’s chest are consistent, would you agree, with signs of a struggle coincidental with manual strangulation? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          A: Coincidental or associated with, yes.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [32] While this evidence seems, at first glance, sufficient of itself to allow the matter to go to the jury, it must be understood in the context of the whole of the evidence. First, ‘consistent with’ is used to mean ‘not inconsistent with’. Second, Professor Hilton comes to the conclusion, also in cross-examination … :  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘I would think the upper trunk, the chest type injuries and the neck type injuries, would be unusual in a fall down the stairs unless that part of the body hits something that was protruding in the course of the said fall.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The staircase in question had a balustrade (itself described by Professor Hilton as a complex surface) with protruding bollards.” 
        
       
      
    43 I should note that there was also evidence that the wall on the side of the staircase had “jagged bricks”, so that it was not only the protruding bollards that could have inflicted some of the deceased’s injuries in the case of a fall. 
     
      
    44 His Honour summarised the factual basis of the Crown case (at [34]): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown relies on what it describes as inferences available from the medical and scientific evidence (already discussed) (namely, the injuries, DNA and blood splattering), the timeline (in particular the alleged 57 minute gap), the tension in the relationship, the lack of any other person with opportunity, the noises heard by the neighbour (and the silence thereafter), together with the financial gain that, it is said, may be motive for the crime. Essentially, the Crown relies upon the facts, set out … above, to allow the drawing of an inference that, from all the possibilities for the means by which these injuries have been caused, the jury should (or may) draw the inference that the deceased was strangled and/or hit over the head (either with the juice extractor component or otherwise) by [PL]. It is unclear in which order this is said to have occurred.” 
        
       
      
    45 The summary of the most pertinent facts is the basis of a circumstantial case. In such a case, the facts are not to be assessed in a piecemeal fashion, as affirmed most recently in The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618 at [48]. 
     
      
       
      The Cause of Death Issue 
       
      
    46 The legal proposition at the heart of the Crown case on Ground 3 is that it is not necessary to establish a precise act causing death in order to establish either murder or manslaughter. The respondent did not challenge the force of the authorities upon which the Crown relied in this respect. 
     
      
    47 The clearest statement in support of the Crown’s legal proposition is perhaps that of Ackner LJ in Attorney General’s Reference (No 4 of 1980) [1981] 1 WLR 705 at 710: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … [T]his reference raises a single and simple question, viz: if an accused kills another by one or other of two or more different acts each of which, if it caused the death, is a sufficient act to establish manslaughter, is it necessary in order to found a conviction to prove which act caused the death? The answer to that question is ‘No, it is not necessary to found a conviction to prove which act caused the death.’ No authority is required to justify this answer, which is clear beyond argument … .” 
        
       
      
    48 That was a case in which the Crown could not prove which of two acts by the accused caused death – although one of them did so. (See also R v McKinnon [1980] 2 NZLR 31.) To similar effect are authorities which indicate that it is not necessary to identify a particular act which caused death where an accused had committed a series of acts, such as a long course of beating, where the fatal kick or blow cannot be identified. (See, eg, R v Ryder [1995] 2 NZLR 271.) 
     
      
    49 As Brennan J said in Royall v The Queen (1990) 172 CLR 378 at 404-405: 
     
      
       
        
        “In most cases of alleged murder, a precise identification of the act which causes death is attempted in order to furnish a foundation for the inference of the mental state with which that act was done. But where the accused has engaged in a course of violent conduct after which the victim does something that directly causes his or her death, it is not essential in point of law to identify which act or series of acts in the course of that conduct caused the victim to take the final fatal step provided the jury be satisfied on the whole of the evidence that some or all of those acts caused the death and was accompanied by one of the mental states prescribed by s 18(1)(a).” 
        
       
      
    50 There have been numerous cases, generally based on circumstantial evidence, where a particular act causing death could not be identified: 
     
      
       
        Where no body was found.  
       (R v Onufrejczyk  
       [1955] 1 QB 388;  
       R v Horry  
       [1952] NZLR 111;  
       Weissensteiner v The Queen  
       (1993) 178 CLR 217;  
       Burrell v The Queen  
       [2007] NSWCCA 65;  
       Burrell v The Queen  
       [2009] NSWCCA 193.) 
       
       
        Where a body was in such a state of decomposition that a cause of death could not be determined. ( 
       R v Robertson  
       (1913) 9 Cr App R 189;  
       Keir v The Queen  
       [2007] NSWCCA 149;  
       Kaliyanda v The Queen  
       [2007] NSWCCA 300.) 
       
       
        Where the Crown case was that the accused either committed the act causing death or was an accessory.  
       (R v Swindall  
       (1864) 2 Car & K 230; 175 ER 95;  
       R v Thatcher  
       [1987] 1 SCR 652;  
       R v Serratore  
       [1999] NSWCCA 377; (1999) 48 NSWLR 101.) 
       
       
        Where a single cause of death could not be identified. ( 
       R v Butcher  
       [1986] VR 43 at 55-56;  
       R v Moffatt  
       [2000] NSWCCA 174; (2000) 112 A Crim R 201 at [26], [61], [66].) 
       
      
    51 In cases of this character an issue of jury unanimity will often arise. However, that line of authority is not pertinent to the present appeal. (See, eg, R v Leivers and Ballinger [1999] 1 Qd R 649; R v Cramp [1999] NSWCCA 324; (1999) 110 A Crim R 198 at [29]-[65]; WGC v The Queen [2007] HCA 58; (2007) 233 CLR 66 at [77]-[92]; R v Spathis [2001] NSWCCA 476 esp at [226]-[274]; R v Walsh [2002] VSCA 98; (2002) 131 A Crim R 299 esp at [45]-[57].) 
     
      
    52 In my opinion, if his Honour proceeded on the basis that the Crown had to establish the particular act of the accused which caused death, then his Honour erred and did so with respect to a question of law alone. 
     
      
       
      Conclusions of Rothman J 
       
      
    53 His Honour came to the following conclusions relevant to Ground 3: 
     
      
       
        
        “[38] Ultimately, the Crown case on cause of death and the means by which it was achieved relies upon the proposition that, “general human experience would be contradicted, if the proved facts were unaccompanied by the fact sought to be proved”, namely, the deceased being hit with the juice extractor, falling back and hitting his head causing the head injuries and some attempt at strangulation, before or after this occurrence, causing the neck injuries. 
        
       
       
        
        [39] In the context of a murder trial, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt: that an act of the accused caused death; that the act was deliberate; and that the accused had an intention to kill, an intention to cause grievous bodily harm or a reckless indifference to human life.  
        
       
       
        
        [40] In this case, the mechanism, being, in this context, the act that caused the injuries causing death, has to be speculative and, as a consequence, renders a finding of a deliberate act by the accused more speculative.  
        A fortiori 
        , it renders the necessary state of mind for murder, most speculative, and not a matter on which the jury is entitled to draw an inference. The jury is not entitled to conjecture or fill the gaps that, without any criticism of the Crown or the police, necessarily arise in this matter.  
        
       
       
        
        [41] Further, given the availability on a charge of murder to the alternative of manslaughter, it is necessary to deal with that aspect. Much of the previous analysis, and all of the facts, are relevant in this regard.  
        
       
       
        
        [42] The relevant difference between murder and manslaughter is, in this case, the state of mind of the perpetrator. In manslaughter it is unnecessary to show an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. However, it is necessary, relevantly, for the Crown to show an unlawful and dangerous act. Since the act causing death is not proved beyond a reasonable doubt, it is mere conjecture to suggest that the accused committed an unlawful and dangerous act, i.e. an act that a reasonable person would understand had an appreciable risk of serious injury:  
        Wilson v R  
        [1992] HCA 31; (1992) 174 CLR 313 at 333. 
        
       
       
        
        [43] In the circumstances, I propose to direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty to murder and, also, not guilty to manslaughter.” 
        
       
      
    54 As I have noted above, the Crown contends that his Honour erred, with particular reference to [40] and [42] of the passage just set out, by proceeding on the basis that it was necessary to identify a particular act of the accused which caused the injuries that led to death. 
     
      
    55 The principal contention on the part of the respondent is that his Honour did not proceed on the false legal basis for which the Crown contends. His Honour’s reasons should be understood as stating that, having regard to the whole of the facts – taken at their highest – guilt could not be established unless the Crown could rely on medical evidence which established the mechanism of death. This, the respondent submitted, was an issue of mixed fact and law and this Court has no jurisdiction on such a matter. If the respondent’s characterisation of his Honour’s reasons is correct, that conclusion does follow. 
     
      
    56 It is necessary to focus on the critical words in [40] and [42].  
     
      
    57 At [40] his Honour characterised the “mechanism” that caused the death as “speculative”, with the consequence that a finding of “a deliberate act” was “more speculative” and that, therefore, a finding of mens rea was “most speculative”. His Honour’s conclusion is expressed in terms of denying any ‘entitlement’ on the part of the jury “to conjecture or fill the gaps”. 
     
      
    58 With respect to [42] his Honour said that, because “the act causing death is not proved beyond a reasonable doubt”, it was “mere conjecture” to suggest that the accused “committed an unlawful and dangerous act”.  
     
      
    59 Each of these references in [40] and [42] appear to me to turn on the proposition in [39] to the effect that the Crown has to prove that “an act of the accused caused death”. This in turn is a reference back to the Crown case “on cause of death” identified in [38]. The matters identified in [38] are directly solely to the alleged act by the respondent of hitting the deceased with a juice extractor and an attempt at strangulation. 
     
      
    60 His Honour was applying s 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 which, relevantly, provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “Murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused … causing the death charged, was done ... with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm … .” 
        
       
      
    61 The structure of [40] contains some ambiguity. It is possible to read it as a conclusion with respect only to the final “most speculative” observation – in effect a conclusion that there was no evidence, taking the Crown’s case at is highest, capable of establishing the mens rea element of the offence. The Crown did not rely on a defect in this final step as a “question of law alone”. 
     
      
    62 The issue to be determined is whether, as the Crown submits, his Honour’s conclusion was based on the legal proposition that the Crown had establish the act which caused the injuries leading to death, on the one hand, or whether it was based on the conclusion that, in the absence of such evidence, and having regard to the whole of the facts, the Crown case taken at its highest, could not be established. 
     
      
    63 The last sentence of [40] states the jury is not entitled to “conjecture or fill the gaps” which, his Honour said, “necessarily arise in this matter”. His Honour had in the preceding two sentences identified three “gaps” with respect to the causal “act”, the ‘deliberateness’ of that act and the state of mind. The gaps were characterised in a crescendo from a base to comparative to superlative – “speculative”, “more speculative”, “most speculative”. 
     
      
    64 His Honour’s reference to “gaps that … necessarily arise” does not, in terms, acknowledge the role of inference in the process of assessment required to be undertaken by the tribunal of fact in a circumstantial case. Such a process is not entirely removed from what may, by an external observer, be characterised as ‘speculation’ or ‘conjecture’. A jury is entitled to draw inferences and, in that manner, to ‘fill gaps’ in the evidence. 
     
      
    65 His Honour concluded at [40], albeit expressly only with respect to the mens rea element, that the jury was “not … entitled to draw an inference”. The language of ‘entitlement’, like the use in the next sentence of the word ‘necessarily’ with respect to the “gaps that … arise”, indicate that his Honour was concluding that it was not open to the jury to draw that inference. It is the linkage ‘a fortiori’ with the first sentence of [40] that the matter to which his Honour had regard was, and it appears to me was only, “the mechanism … causing death”. 
     
      
    66 “[T]he mechanism” to which his Honour referred in the opening sentence of [40], being terminology he had adopted from one expert report (see at [37], [39]-[40] above), was clearly a reference to the medical evidence about the difficulty of identifying the act which caused the injuries, to which evidence his Honour referred at [15] as “at best ambivalent”. (See [37] above.)  
     
      
    67 There is, in the passage from [38]-[42], no indication that any other fact was regarded by his Honour as pertinent. It does appear that his Honour treated the need to establish the act that caused death as an essential requirement to prove homicide.  
     
      
    68 At [44] above, I have set out [34] of his Honour’s judgment which summarises the Crown’s circumstantial case. By expressly giving determinative significance to the inability to establish a particular cause of death, Rothman J did not pay regard to the other facts to which the jury could have had regard on the issue of both the actus reus and mens rea of the offence charged: the evidence of a fight, the absence of any other person on the premises, the time delay before contacting 000. 
     
      
    69 This conclusion is reinforced by the terminology in [42] that a manslaughter case was “mere conjecture” because “the act causing death is not proved beyond a reasonable doubt”. His Honour did not say that it was not open to the jury to conclude, in the light of all of the circumstances, that an essential element of the offence charged – “the act of the accused … causing the death” – had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. His Honour’s terminology that the act “is not proved beyond reasonable doubt” directs attention, in the light of the analysis at [38]-[40], only to the medical evidence on the “mechanism” of death.  
     
      
    70 Although my mind has fluctuated in the respect, ultimately I am satisfied that the conclusions in [40] and [42] are based on an assumption that, as a matter of law, the Crown had to identify the act by the accused that caused the death.  
     
      
    71 As I have indicated, the respondent submits that his Honour should be understood as saying that having regard to all of the evidence, this was such a weak case on causation, that he concluded that, in this case, the act causing death had to be established beyond reasonable doubt. However, his Honour did not say that. Nor did he refer to the broader factual matrix in any way in the crucial parts of his reasons. 
     
      
    72 Accordingly, in my opinion, the Crown’s submission that his Honour erred on a question of law alone should be accepted. This proposition of law was a discrete starting point for his subsequent analysis. It was a separate and distinct proposition of law which his Honour proceeded to apply to the facts of the case. Whilst that application involved questions of fact, the starting point did not. 
     
      
    73 Ground 3 is made out. The Court must determine what, if any orders, should be made, under s 107(5) and s 107(6) of the Act, which I have set out at [3] above. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    74 Once the jurisdiction of the Court has been attracted under s 107(2) and the Court has upheld the ground of appeal, the Court must decide whether to quash the acquittal pursuant to s 107(5) and whether it should exercise the power to “order a new trial” in a “manner” to be specified pursuant to s 107(6).  
     
      
    75 Section 107 applies in three circumstances; a verdict by direction, trial by judge alone and an exercise of summary jurisdiction in proceedings to which the Crown was a party. These three circumstances share a common characteristic: that the proceedings have been disposed of by a judge without a jury decision.  
     
      
    76 Part 8 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act applies to a number of other situations including when “fresh and compelling evidence” has arisen after an acquittal for an offence punishable by imprisonment for life (s 100) and in the case of a “tainted acquittal”, within the meaning of s 103 of the Act, for an offence punishable by imprisonment for life or by a period of 15 years or more (s 101). 
     
      
    77 The powers of the Court in each of these other two cases within Pt 8 are expressed in different terms to s 107(6). Each of s 100(1)(b) and s 101(1)(b) provide: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Court of Criminal Appeal may … order an acquitted person to be retried … if satisfied that: 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in all the circumstances it is in the interests of justice for the order to be made.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    78 Furthermore s 104 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) This section applies for the purpose of determining under this Division whether it is in the interests of justice for an order to be made for the retrial of an acquitted person. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) It is not in the interests of justice to make an order for the retrial of an acquitted person unless the  
        Court 
         of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that a fair retrial is likely in the circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The  
        Court 
         is to have regard in particular to:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the length of time since the acquitted person allegedly committed the offence, and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) whether any police officer or  
          prosecutor 
           has failed to act with reasonable diligence or expedition in connection with the application for the retrial of the acquitted person.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    79 It is pertinent to note, with respect to s 107(6), that the discretion is not confined, or rather directed, in this way. 
     
      
    80 As noted above there is authority that a judge proposing to direct a verdict of acquittal should not do so on the basis that it appears to him that a conviction would be unreasonable, or as it used to be expressed, “unsafe and unsatisfactory”. (See R v R; Doney.) The issue that has arisen, for the first time with respect to s 107, is whether the discretions found within the words “may … quash the acquittal” and “may order a new trial” are relevantly unconfined. The kinds of considerations that are taken into account on appeal, as to whether or not a conviction was ‘reasonable’, within the meaning of s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act, may be considerations that could inform the exercise of such discretions.  
     
      
    81 If this Court is satisfied, on the evidence presented by the Crown at the trial, that an appeal would be allowed on the basis that a conviction was unreasonable, should the Court exercise its discretion against quashing the acquittal or ordering a new trial? Furthermore, in the present case one of the options available to the Court, if that be the proper interpretation of the power, is to determine whether any new trial should be limited to the charge of manslaughter.  
     
      
    82 Although the only charge on the indictment was murder, his Honour did direct a verdict of acquittal on both murder and manslaughter. No issue was raised in this respect. In form it is open to this Court to quash one or both of those verdicts. 
     
      
    83 It is well established that the word “may” appearing in some legal texts must be understood as “must”. With respect to a legislative scheme that overturns a long established fundamental principle of the criminal law, the word “may” cannot be so construed. The double jeopardy principle is of that character. (Cf R v Snow (1915) 20 CLR 315 esp at 322, 362; R v Cheng [1999] NSWCCA 373; (1999) 48 NSWLR 616 at [32]-[34]; R v JS supra at [26]-[32].) 
     
      
    84 The significance of this change is an important part of the statutory context in which the powers conferred by s 107(5) and (6) must be construed. Even if there had not been a directed verdict on both murder and manslaughter, in my opinion, it would be open to the Court, pursuant to s 107(6), to order a new trial limited to manslaughter, for analogous reasons to those adopted on a different legislative scheme in AJS v The Queen [2007] HCA 27; (2008) 235 CLR 505 esp at [14]-[17]. 
     
      
    85 The terminology of s 107(6) is clearly drawn from s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In R v Murrell [2001] NSWCCA 179; (2001) 123 A Crim R 54, this Court considered whether, pursuant to s 8(1) of that Act, it should order a new trial limited to manslaughter, where the Court believed (at [33]) that the Crown case could not sustain a charge of murder. In the event, the Court did not do so for reasons which suggest that what was involved was the exercise of the discretion (using words such as “prudent” and “preferable” at [42]-[43]). The High Court left open the authority of Murrell in AJS at [20]-[21]. 
     
      
    86 There are a number of precedents for a court exercising a power to order a new trial for a lesser charge in exercise of a power equivalent to s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. (See, eg, Kelly v The King (1923) 32 CLR 509; R v Miller [1951] VLR 346; The Queen v Hanias (1976) 14 SASR 137.) However, those sections were part of a legislative scheme which authorised the Court of Criminal Appeal to order a substituted verdict, such as s 7 of the Criminal Appeal Act. There is no such express provision in Pt 8 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. 
     
      
    87 Notwithstanding this difference in the statutory framework, the abrogation of the double jeopardy principle is a powerful consideration indicating that the Court was intended to be able to exercise its discretionary powers so as to minimise the injustice associated with a new trial after an acquittal. (See Vallance v The Queen (1961) 108 CLR 56 at 62; R v Turner [2001] WASCA 344; (2001) 25 WAR 258 at [24]; R v Hutchinson [2003] WASCA 323; (2003) 144 A Crim R 28 at [14]-[15], [43].) 
     
      
    88 In a passage frequently cited by Australian Courts, Black J said in Green v United States, 355 US 184 at 187-188 (1957): 
     
      
       
        
        “The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.” 
        
       
      
    89 Accordingly, there are circumstances in which the courts will order a stay of a second prosecution. (See, eg, Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [116]-[118]). 
     
      
    90 In my opinion, in the context of an appeal against an acquittal by directed verdict, this Court should exercise its discretion not to order a new trial if it is satisfied that a conviction would be overturned as unreasonable, or on any other basis which would not result in a new trial on a successful conviction appeal. 
     
      
    91 Although, on the authority of R v R, the trial judge cannot direct a verdict on that basis, the principle of double jeopardy, notwithstanding its partial abrogation, remains a fundamental principle of our criminal law. It should be given effect in the manner I have indicated. 
     
      
    92 The Crown relied, on the exercise of the discretion, on the principle that the Court should not constrain the prosecutorial discretion. In Maxwell v The Queen (1995-1996) 184 CLR 501, Dawson and McHugh JJ said at 512: 
     
      
       
        
        “Our courts do not purport to exercise control over the institution or continuation of criminal proceedings, save where it is necessary to do so to prevent an abuse of process or to ensure a fair trial.” 
        
       
      
    93 If this Court formed the opinion that an appeal from a new trial would be upheld, then that new trial would constitute a relevant abuse of process. 
     
      
    94 The Crown case for the mens rea element of murder is exceptionally weak. No aspect of the medical or scientific evidence supports anything like an intent to kill. The suggested murder weapon – the metal bowl of a juice extractor – takes this element no further. There was evidence of an argument and of a physical fight. The evidence of an attempt at strangulation, which Rothman J emphasised, was potentially the best evidence on intent, even though that was not the cause of death. However, that evidence was equivocal. 
     
      
    95 The suggested motives – financial advantage and deterioration of the relationship – are insufficient without objective evidence of the events, which go no higher than a fight and weak evidence of an attempt at strangulation. 
     
      
    96 In my opinion, if the respondent were convicted of murder on a new trial, that conviction would be overturned as unreasonable on appeal. Accordingly, the orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
        
        1 Affirm the acquittal on the charge of murder. 
        
       
       
        
        2 Quash the verdict of acquittal on the charge of manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
        3 Order a new trial limited to a charge of manslaughter. 
        
       
      
    97 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Spigelman CJ. 
     
      
    98 R A HULME J: I agree with Spigelman CJ.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Leroy Cummins pleaded guilty at an earlier stage to two offences, one being assault occasioning actual bodily harm and the other being stealing from a person. The matter has proceeded today before me and an issue has arisen as to whether I should accept Mr Cummins’ plea to the second of those matters, that is the stealing from a person matter.2 I cannot accept a plea of guilty which I do not consider to be a genuine acknowledgement of guilt. Usually the fact of the plea itself is sufficient to demonstrate an acknowledgement of guilt and an acceptance that the elements of the offence are satisfied. However the accused gave evidence, before me today, and the question which has arisen in my mind is whether he does admit one of the elements of the offence of stealing from a person, that is an intention to steal the property particularised in the indictment.3 I accept that it is in Mr Cummins’ interest to have the matter dealt with to finality as quickly as possible. He has put, through his counsel, a strong subjective case, one which would have a considerable effect upon not only the length of the sentence that I would impose upon Mr Cummins but also the nature of the sentence.4 However it is a matter of fundamental legal principle that a person who is not genuinely acknowledging his guilt should not be sentenced on the basis of a convenient plea of guilty.5 In this case the offender gave evidence as to his intention or his purpose in picking up the items. I accept that there is a difference between him knowing what he was thinking at the time and what he in fact intended especially given the substantial level of intoxication that was influencing him at the time. Thus, it may be that he could say I have no memory of intending to steal the items but I accept that I must have had that intention. He does not however say that. He says that he does not know what he meant to do when he picked up the items. He does not accept, as far as I understand his evidence, that he did intend to steal the property.6 It is a matter of great regret that this will require that the matter be listed for a trial. I wish, however, to say something else. It may well be that upon further reflection Mr Cummins is prepared to admit that from what he knows about the circumstances of that day he accepts that he intended to steal the items. If so of course then he is entitled to plead guilty at a later date and entitled to have the appropriate discount for pleading guilty applied to his sentence.7 The order I am making today is not intended at all to preclude Mr Cummins later pleading guilty. Of course it would be better if further proceedings were taken before a different judge rather than me.8 The matter will be listed in court 3.1 next Friday 16 October 2009.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: After trial by jury the offender was convicted of murdering the deceased, Kara Kenny, at Wyong on 20 October 2007. He was also convicted of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on her grandmother, Doris Jerums. Before the trial the offender pleaded guilty to a charge that on 20 October 2007 he used an offensive weapon to prevent the lawful apprehension of himself. The charge of murder carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 20 years. The assault charge carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years and the offensive weapon charge a maximum penalty of 12 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 When first arraigned before the jury the offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the murder charge and guilty to the other two offences. The Crown did not accept the manslaughter plea. However, after he had given evidence before the jury, I rejected the pleas of guilty to the charge of manslaughter and the assault charge. 
     
      
    3 The facts can be briefly stated. The offences all arise from the one incident that occurred over several hours in the early morning of 20 October 2007. The offender and the deceased had been in a relationship since 2001 when the deceased was aged 18, five years younger than the offender. At the time of the stabbing the relationship had ceased but they were living in the same premises, a townhouse rented by the deceased. She had permitted the offender to stay there because he had nowhere else to live. The townhouse was next door to similar premises in which the deceased’s grandparents lived. The deceased and the offender had two children then aged 5 and 2. 
     
      
    4 The relationship between the offender and the deceased had been punctuated by domestic violence. There was evidence before the jury that on occasions the offender had threatened or assaulted the deceased and on at least two occasions she had sought refuge with her mother or grandparents. The offender would become aggressive under the influence of alcohol. On one occasion, when the deceased was staying with her grandparents in order to avoid the offender, he came to the house. While the grandfather was trying to get him to leave the premises, the offender struck him in the face breaking his nose. 
     
      
    5 On the evening of the killing there had been a number of disputes between the offender and the deceased over the children. At about 10.30pm they had an argument about the fact that the children were not in bed. The offender left the premises and went to a local hotel where he purchased 6 full-size bottles of full-strength beer. He consumed them sitting on the front patio of the premises. 
     
      
    6 At 11.56 pm the deceased came into the grandparent’s premises with the youngest child to use the phone to make a triple 0 call. During the call she said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ..my kids father’s been staying there and he’s just, like been drinking and he’s carrying on and I think he’s smashing the place up……..I just want him to go away for the night. 
        
       
       
      She asked that the police be sent as soon as possible. 
       
      
    7 The deceased made a second triple 0 call at 12.02am. During the course of it the offender arrived at the grandparent’s home. The deceased told him to leave and that she would give him money for a motel. He insisted that she open the door but the deceased refused. Eventually the offender kicked in the front door. He was armed with two knives that he had earlier taken from a knife case in the garage. The triple 0 call graphically records what then happened. 
     
      
    8 As the offender entered the premises he told the grandfather to back off. The deceased fled towards a bedroom with the child. The grandmother attempted to get between the offender and the deceased armed with a statue of David that she used to threaten the offender. He pushed her out of the way causing her to fall to the ground and her artificial leg to come off. He then kicked in the door to the bedroom. The deceased said, “You’ll kill me” and the offender stated, “I’ll fucking kill you alright don’t worry about that cunt”. He then said, “I fuckin got ya alright”. He threatened to kill the grandfather if he came into the room. 
     
      
    9 The deceased came out bent over with pain as she had been stabbed in the stomach. She fell into a chair. The offender approached her, pulled up her head and slit the side of her neck with a knife. The grandmother yelled out, “He stabbed her in the neck”. 
     
      
    10 The offender ran out to the front of the premises still holding the knives. He threatened both the grandfather and a neighbour not to come near the premises. A short time later two police officers arrived. The offender still armed with the knives threatened them and they drew their pistols. Officer McCarthy and other police negotiated with the offender over a period of almost three hours before he finally put the knives down. During the course of this stand off the offender frequently threatened police asking them to shoot him. 
     
      
    11 The deceased died as a result of a single stab wound to the stomach. The wound to the neck was not life threatening. The grandmother suffered an injury to her leg that required her to take to her bed for about 9 weeks. 
     
      
    12 When the trial commenced before the jury, the defence was that the offender did not have the intention to kill the deceased because of his intoxication or, in the alternative, that the defence of substantial impairment had been made out. However, during the course of the trial the offender gave a version in evidence that asserted the stabbing was accidental and that at the time he was acting in defence of his son. He also denied having intentionally pushed the grandmother over. This version was inherently improbable, inconsistent with the triple 0 call and, unsurprisingly, rejected by the jury. 
     
      
    13 There was a considerable amount of evidence concerning the offender’s mental health. All of the psychiatrists who gave evidence at the trial were of the opinion that the offender was suffering from a depressive illness that impaired his ability to control himself. However, there is little doubt that the consumption of alcohol played a significant role in the offender’s depressive illness, at least on occasions when it resulted in suicidal and homicidal thoughts. But despite having convictions involving the use of alcohol, his history of alcohol-related violence and depression, and the fact that alcohol clearly played a part in the death of the deceased, the offender told Dr Nielssen that he did not believe that he had any problem with alcohol.  
     
      
    14 There has been a history of depression as a result of his relationship problems and exacerbated by chronic back-pain. There have been suicidal thoughts that have resulted on at least two occasions in serious suicide attempts one in 1996 and another in 2004, the latter requiring admission to intensive care after a drug overdose. He has had admissions to psychiatric care including in May 2007, that is about 6 months before the killing. On that occasion he voluntarily sought help because of having suicidal and homicidal thoughts. He discharged himself after two days without any follow-up treatment. On occasions he has been treated with anti-depressant medications. 
     
      
    15 There was an issue at the trial as to whether the offender was suffering from a brain injury. A PET scan of the offender’s brain revealed an abnormality of the medial aspect of the temporal lobe and which would have interacted with the use of alcohol. According to Dr Lowe this could have meant that the offender tended to be more aggressive especially when under the influence of alcohol. This did not assume any significance at the trial because the jury were obliged to ignore the effects of alcohol when considering whether the defence of substantial impairment applied. However, I am prepared to accept for the purpose of sentencing that the offender suffered from depression and a brain injury that made him less able to control himself when under the influence of alcohol. 
     
      
    16 However, although the offender has periods of depression when he contemplates taking his own life, there is nothing to indicate that before he consumed alcohol on this evening he was showing any mental disturbance at all. He had been at the deceased’s mother’s premises earlier that day and was using her computer to access the Internet. 
     
      
    17 The offender’s mental state is a matter that has a limited mitigatory effect in an assessment of his objective criminality. The offender must have been aware that, if he consumed substantial amounts of alcohol, he ran the very real risk that he would become depressed and have aggressive thoughts. He had shown a degree of insight into his condition when he admitted himself for psychiatric assistance in May prior to the killing of the deceased. 
     
      
    18 It was put to the jury on the offender’s behalf and repeated before me in the sentencing proceedings that the offender was not significantly intoxicated notwithstanding the amount of alcohol he had consumed. Reliance was placed upon the evidence of the two police officers who were first on the scene and did not believe that he was affected by alcohol. But I do not accept that their evidence is reliable: they clearly had other things on their minds. An observer, Sgt Lawson, believed the offender was intoxicated and the evidence of Dr Pearl reveals that he must have had a reading of about 0.15. The offender himself told police that he was moderately affected. 
     
      
    19 As I have noted the offence of murder carries a standard non-parole period. It is necessary to take the stepped approach in determining the sentence that has been described in a number of decisions in the Court of Criminal Appeal: see MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; 164 A Crim R 93. Had it not been for the offender’s mental state the murder would have been at the upper end of mid range of objective seriousness if not slightly above that point. 
     
      
    20 Taking into account his mental state the offence is slightly below mid range. The offence was not an instantaneous reaction to some act that he thought was provocative on the part of the deceased. He armed himself with what he knew were sharp knives from the garage in preference to the knives in the kitchen. He pursued the deceased whom he knew was seeking refuge in the grandparent’s residence. When entrance was refused to him, he forced his way into the premises. He still pursued the deceased when she locked herself in the bedroom, and forcibly entered that room. It is clear that he intended to kill her from what he said at the time and the act of slitting her neck with the knife while she was in the chair. There was a history of violent behaviour by him to her and others when he was under the influence of alcohol. He killed her in the presence of the youngest child although hopefully he was not fully aware of what was happening. He made threats to any person who might have sought to assist her. 
     
      
    21 However, it is clear that the offender was mentally disturbed at the time and was suicidal in relation to his conduct to the police. The statements he made to the police about the deceased and his wish for her to die have to be viewed in light of his mental state at the time that was highly aggressive both to himself as well as others. But the offender has never shown any remorse for her death, and the purpose of his evidence and accounts he gave to the psychiatrists was to blame her for the incident that led to the stabbing and to assert that she caused her own death by running on to his knife. 
     
      
    22 Mr Scragg who appeared for the offender on sentence submitted that the offence was mitigated because the offender was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions; see s 21A(3)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I do not accept that submission, and, as I have already noted, the offender intended to kill the deceased and was very much aware of what he was doing. His mental illness however made him less able to control himself especially when he had consumed alcohol. This does lessen his culpability for the offence but I do not believe it has any other impact upon the sentence to be imposed upon him. It will not make his custodial situation more onerous and it does not mean that general deterrence should be substantially reduced when sentencing for the offence of murder committed in the context of domestic violence. I do not intend however to take into account specific deterrence in light of the period he must serve in custody before he could be eligible for release. 
     
      
    23 There is little by way of personal factors that bear upon the determination of the non-parole period. I have no understanding of his prospects for rehabilitation and, in any event, that is a matter best judged by the parole board when he comes to be eligible for release after many years in custody. He was at the time of the killing a danger to members of the community but with treatment for his depression and, if he abstains from alcohol, he may not be so in the future. 
     
      
    24 I have heard from members of the deceased’s family as to the impact of her death upon them. The Court sympathises with their loss. I cannot, however, impose a heavier sentence upon the offender because of that loss no matter how severe it might be or because he has deprived two innocent children of their mother. 
     
      
    25 The Crown accepts that the offence committed against the grandmother is overwhelmed by the seriousness of the murder and the totality of his criminality in killing the deceased is not increased by that offence. Therefore the sentence for that offence should be made concurrent with the sentence for the murder. The Crown, however, submitted that there should be an accumulated sentence for the offence committed against the police as being a separate act of serious criminality that continued for a considerable amount of time. 
     
      
    26 Offences involving threats of violence to police officers who are acting in the course of their duties demand that deterrent sentences be imposed for the protection of members of the police force. This was, however, an unusual case. The offender was clearly threatening the police only in order that they would kill him. It was an attempted suicide. The more serious threat was to others who might have sought to assist the deceased such as ambulance officers, the grandfather or a neighbour. The offender would have been shot before he had inflicted any harm on a police officer. He had to get near enough to have used one of the weapons and he would have been killed or seriously wounded before he could have carried out the threat. In fact at one stage officer McCarthy had her finger on the trigger about to fire her weapon just before the offender turned away from her. The conduct toward the police was the result of the same mental state of the offender that led to him killing the deceased. He was both homicidal and suicidal. 
     
      
    27 In any event the sentence for the murder takes into account threats he made to her grandfather before and after the killing and threats to any person that might assist her. In this very unusual case and having regard to the fact that the offender is to be sentenced for murder, I do not intend to impose any further sentence for his conduct to the police having regard to his mental state at the time. In that regard he is not a suitable vehicle for general deterrence. The sentence will be reduced somewhat for the plea of guilty but it was of little utilitarian value because the facts of that offence had to be led on the trial for the charge of murder. I give him a discount of 15 per cent. 
     
      
    28 There are no special circumstances and Mr Scragg did not suggest that there were. The usual proportion between the non-parole period and the balance of the term will give ample time for supervision if the parole board releases him at the conclusion of the non-parole period. There is no other reason to reduce the non-parole period. Because of the non-parole period imposed for the offence of murder there will be fixed terms imposed for the other two offences. 
     
      
    29 On the charge of murder the offender is sentenced to a total period of custody of 23 years. There is to be a non-parole period of 17 years 3 months and a balance of term of 5 years 9 months. The sentence is to date from 20 October 2007 and the non-parole period expires on 19 January 2025, the date he is first eligible for release to parole 
     
      
    30 On the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm the offender is sentenced to a fixed term of 22 months to date from 20 October 2007 and that expired on 19 August 2009. 
     
      
    31 On the charge of using an offensive weapon the offender is sentenced to a fixed term of 3 years and 3 months to date from 20 October 2007 and is to expire on 19 January 2011. 
     
      
    32 I wish to commend the conduct of police officer McCarthy for her courageous yet patient and sympathetic handling of a difficult situation when under threat of the offender. The incident concluded without harm to any person including the offender principally through her behaviour.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Tony Pulitano was dealt with by me in May 2008 for offences that he committed almost ten years before. The offences were serious ones and on 2 May 2008 I set out the circumstances of the offender’s crimes. I also explained that the ten-year gap was due to Mr Pulitano absconding. He was eventually picked up in New South Wales for those matters and appeared before me last year. 2 What brings him before the court today is yet more absconding, if I can call it that. In May 2008 I dealt with Mr Pulitano by putting him on a s 12 bond, that is I imposed a sentence of imprisonment but suspended it. I explained to Mr Pulitano the consequences of a breach of the bond. One of the conditions of the bond was that he was supervised by the Department of Justice in Victoria where he then lived.3 Things went well for a time. The offender moved from Victoria to New South Wales and transferred his supervision from the Department of Justice in Victoria to the Department of Corrective Services in New South Wales. Things continued to go well in this state and indeed in late 2008 the Probation and Parole Service had formed the intention that they would seek to terminate Mr Pulitano’s supervision.4 However things went downhill again. Mr Payten suggests that the downhill path that his client then took was related to him undergoing a course of treatment for hepatitis C. The offender commenced that treatment on 9 September 2008 and almost immediately suffered from significant side effects. The possibility of these side effects had been made known to him before he commenced the treatment, but he reported when he was seen a month later, substantial fatigue, depressed mood, suicidal ideation, flu-like symptoms, a lack of motivation and a lack of appetite. He also told the doctor supervising his Interferon treatment that he had begun using heroin again.5 His wife decided that in order to look after herself, her children and ultimately the offender himself she would leave him and return to Melbourne. She did this and the offender soon followed. When he went back to Melbourne, he did not give any real attention to the need to comply with the conditions of the bond which I imposed upon him. In particular he did not give any real attention to the need that he be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service, I should add also that at the same time was committing a breach of the bond I put him on. 6 By returning to Melbourne, the offender also failed to appear for a matter in Waverly Local Court. Thus the offender has a history of failing to obey court orders. He absconded for his 1998 offences. He did not comply with the conditions of the bond I put him on. He failed to appear despite being required to do so, in Waverly Local Court recently. I should add parenthetically that although the offender is being charged with two other matters, they are defended and so I will not proceed on the basis, of course, that he is guilty of those matters.7 Mr Pulitano accepts that he has breached the bond. He accepts that he failed to accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and failed to notify them of his change of address. He came back to New South Wales in July this year and was arrested for breaching various warrants a day or two later. He has been in custody since 27 July 2009. 8 When giving evidence today he said he had no familiarity with a s 12 sentence of imprisonment and did not really know what would happen. I reject that completely. When I sentenced Mr Pulitano last year, I said: 
     
      
      ”Mr Pulitano should be under not misapprehension as to what is likely to happen should he commit a further offence. He will go to gaol. I will be the one who puts him in gaol if he commits any breach of the good behaviour bond which I will short announce.” 
      
    9 At the conclusion of my remarks on sentence I spoke to Mr Pulitano directly. I said: 
     
      
      If you commit any offence in the next 18 months or you breach the good behaviour bond in any way in the next 18 months, you will be going to gaol for 18 months. You will get the sentence you should have got in 1998, do you understand?” 
      
    10 Mr Pulitano replied, “Yes, your Honour.” In language that I am sure he understood, I said: 
     
      
      “If you commit an offence you will be in gaol. If you don’t commit an offence then you won’t. Okay.” 
      
    11 Mr Pulitano can have been under no misapprehension that breaching the bond would lead to him going to gaol, although his thinking may well have been clouded as a result of the Interferon. As I pointed out to Mr Payten in argument, he was a person who had the sword of Damocles hanging over his head. He was also the sort of person who has a history of failing to meet his obligations. Mr Payten asked me to accept that there are good reasons for excusing the bond under s 98 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I do not accept that that is the case. 12 It must be remembered that a sentence of imprisonment which is then suspended under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is a sentence of some leniency. A person only gets a s 12 sentence where the judge or magistrate has decided that imprisonment is required. To then suspend the execution of that sentence so that instead of serving time in custody, the offender walks free from court without any punishment being imposed upon him at all is a very lenient outcome. 13 Nevertheless s 12 sentences are valuable outcomes in many cases. Indeed, as is obvious, I considered it an appropriate outcome in the present case. But they can only continue to be valuable outcomes if they retain the support of the community. I am sure many members of the community have trouble with the concept that a sentence of imprisonment has been imposed and then immediately suspended. If courts are too ready to then excuse breaches of s12 bonds, then community acceptance of the outcome is likely to diminish radically. It would be a rare case where an offender such as Mr Pulitano would be in a position to demonstrate good reasons for excusing his breach of the bond. I am not satisfied that there are good reasons in the present case. 14 The intentions behind the s 12 bond that I imposed clearly included personal deterrence. I was also promoting Mr Pulitano’s rehabilitation by reminding him of the sentence that he should have got in 1998 and by telling him that that is the sentence he would get if he breached the bond. In those circumstances I cannot find that there are good reasons for excusing his breach.15 As a fallback position Mr Payten ask that I take those matter into account in deciding whether or not there are special circumstances. In the present case the Crown does not speak in opposition to such a finding. I am satisfied that there are special circumstances; they relate to the circumstance that the offender does finally seem to be growing out of frequent offending and frequent drug use. He is now forty-seven years of age. And perhaps it is finally occurring to him that he is wasting a lot of his life living as he does.16 There are prospects of his rehabilitation which are enhanced by him being supervised by the Probation and Parole Service. I therefore make the following order: the order suspending the execution of the sentence of imprisonment is revoked. The offender is sentenced therefore to imprisonment for eighteen months. The non-parole period is nine months. It will have commenced on 27 July 2009 and will thus expire on 26 April 2010 on which day the offender is to be released to parole. It is a condition of his release to parole that he accept supervision of the Probation and Parole Service.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Justin Paul COX, has pleaded guilty to the murder of Samuel Connolly in the early hours of 2 January 2009 at Narooma. In sentencing him for that offence he has asked that I take into account that earlier on the same night he assaulted and inflicted actual bodily harm upon Mr Connolly.2 The offender was born on 20 December 1982 at Penrith. He lived in that area with his family until they moved to Narooma when he was about 7 years of age. He was educated at Werrington County Primary School and then Narooma Public School and Narooma High School. He experienced learning difficulties, perhaps because of dyslexia, and exhibited behavioural problems at school. He was disruptive, got involved in fights, was defiant of teachers and, in his last two years, his attendance was infrequent. He was expelled in Year 9 after a physical fight with a teacher and throwing a table at the principal. 3 He then had a variety of jobs, mainly in retail stores. He met his partner, Rebecca Graham in 2003. She had two children from a previous relationship, a son born in 2001 and a younger daughter. Together they had a son born in 2005 and a daughter born in 2008.4 Around the time he met Rebecca he commenced working with his father in a waste management business. Initially this was part-time but eventually became full-time. He acquired skills operating machinery and driving bulldozers and front end loaders. This was work he found satisfying and he was well remunerated.5 Rebecca’s son from her previous relationship was killed in an accident along with a playmate in 2006. Initially the couple tried to continue their lives but difficulties in the relationship arose from the grief and stress they undoubtedly experienced. They blamed themselves and each other. They argued more frequently. Rebecca ended up leaving him in early 2007 when she moved to Sydney. He responded with a serious suicide attempt. He remained on the South Coast with his employment in the waste management business but had developed an amphetamine habit and was drinking heavily. Thereafter he held a number of jobs interspersed with periods of unemployment. He had some fortnightly counselling sessions with a psychologist for about four months. He accepts that he has had anger issues in the past but found greater difficulty in controlling escalating anger, particularly if he had been drinking.6 In 2007 and 2008 he lived at Narooma, Canberra and Sydney. He moved back to Narooma in October 2008 where he moved in with a friend, James Nathanial Rae who lived in a unit in a small block on Harper Crescent. At this time he claims to have stopped caring about anything. He drank heavily on a daily basis and did not care if he lived or died. He was no longer using drugs at this stage. He also appears to have developed an obsessive compulsive disorder. 7 The offender told Ms Anita Duffy, psychologist, how he had always been prone to outbursts of anger which led to conflict at school. He claimed that he had learnt to control himself better in later years but conceded that he had less control when drinking. He told Ms Duffy of harming himself during drunken outbursts of anger. He told her of an incident in which he had hit a steel pole repeatedly until he almost broke his knuckles when drunk. 8 All of this sets the scene for what happened to Mr Connolly. Samuel Connolly was a 47 year old man who lived in the unit next to the offender’s friend, Nathaniel Rae. The offender met him when he moved in with Mr Rae, although he previously knew him by sight. The offender claims that he tolerated him as a “very interrupting and annoying drunk who would walk into their home unannounced and ask for beer or for money”. At some point, however, he heard talk that Mr Connolly had been evicted from a Koori mission at Wallaga Lake because he had sexually assaulted children. The offender conceded in his evidence before me that he had no actual evidence of this but I accept that he held such a belief.9 On New Year’s Eve the offender had been drinking during the day but not to the usual excess and not at all during the evening when he was babysitting the child of Mr Rae and his girlfriend. He decided to make up for it the following day when he commenced drinking at around 9.00 a.m. 10 The offender came home sometime late in the afternoon and there were words exchanged with Mr Connolly who was also intoxicated. The offender then went to a nearby house to continue drinking. He received a call from Mr Rae who told him that Mr Connolly was out the front of his unit with a mob threatening to attack him. The offender hurried back to the unit where he found that Mr Rae had locked himself in and Mr Connolly was outside calling out something. There was no mob. The offender then challenged him to a fight. Mr Connolly did not take up the challenge. This is how the offender later described to the police what happened: 
     
      
       
        
        Little fuckin’ peaheart got on his hands and knees on the ground because he wouldn’t go me but he’d go Nathaniel. I then proceeded to punch him in the face like the dog he was.  
        
       
      
    11 The offender admitted that he struck Mr Connolly a number of times to the head and that he ended up with a cut to his own knuckles. The assault concluded with the offender saying to Mr Connolly, “You ever threaten my brother’s life again, I will come and snap your fuckin’ neck”. 12 This incident comprises the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the Form 1 document. The actual bodily harm sustained by Mr Connolly was a split lip. The police asked the offender to describe his own level of intoxication at this point and he replied, “Pissed”.13 The offender then left and continued drinking somewhere that he could not recall. He returned to the unit “some hour, early hour in the morning”. He was accompanied by someone whose name he was not prepared to provide to the police. In his evidence before me he named this person as Graham Cox (no relation). He said that he noticed Mr Connolly lying on the couch inside his unit through the open front door. The offender proceeded inside Mr Rae’s unit where he consumed some more alcohol. The evidence does not disclose what Mr Cox did. 14 The offender said that he could hear Mr Connolly through the “paper thin walls” and that he was “cursing and going off about white people, saying he’s going to get a mob onto me and Nathaniel”. The offender challenged him again to a fight but Mr Connolly did not respond. The offender then called him a paedophile and he claims that Mr Connolly admitted that he was one and said, “Who cares?”. At some stage he heard Mr Connolly slam closed the front door of his unit. The offender described to the police what happened then: 
     
      
       
        
        “I then in a blind rage snapped, walked into Nathaniel’s room, lifted his bed, pulled out approximately 40 to 50 centimetre truck wrench missing the internal wrench part. I climbed across the veranda, I pulled his screen off, I went through his open window and proceeded to beat him across the body while he layed (sic) on his couch”. 
        
       
      
    15 He said he then returned to Mr Rae’s unit, washed the implement and himself and then left. He said that as he passed Mr Connolly’s unit he saw through the window that he was not on the couch and there was a light on in the bathroom. In other words, he understood Mr Connolly to be alive. Unbeknown to the offender he was to die an hour or two later.16 The offender provided further details of what happened in the balance of the police interview. The wrench was 40 – 50 cm or 50 – 60 cm long and about 2 – 3 kg in weight. It was pitch black in Mr Connolly’s unit but his eyes had adjusted and he could generally make out where his body was. As he approached Mr Connolly he was thinking that he was a “dirty fuckin’ paedophile little faggot (who) stuck his dick in a kid”. He was not aiming for any particular part of his body and did not know which parts he actually hit. Later he said that he did not think that he hit him in the head because it felt like he was hitting the upper body. He said he did not want to hit him in the head because he knew that would hurt. He agreed that it was foreseeable that he could have struck Mr Connolly’s head and that it was also foreseeable that death or serious injury could result. He struck Mr Connolly 5 to 10 times and each time his body bounced about a foot off the couch. Although he was “very” intoxicated, he realised what he was doing. He said he, “Just wanted to make him feel suffering like I have”. He went there to cause him pain. When asked about how he hurried away from the premises he said that was because, “I was in a rage. I was skitzing out, like I don’t know, I just, yeah, that’s how I get sometimes. I don’t know. Ever since my boy’s died, I get in these moods sometimes and I don’t remember what I do or I go overboard, do you know what I mean?”. He also said that becoming angry when drinking had been happening a lot to him lately. “Someone rolls (sic - riles?) me up, I just lose the plot. There’s no explanation for it”. At the end of the interview, when asked if there was anything further he wished to say, he said, “Just that I regret it, that I’m ashamed and that I offer my own life if they want it”. 17 This interview with the police took place at around midnight on the night of 3-4 January 2009. The offender had been arrested on the morning of 2 January when he was still intoxicated. He had received legal advice and declined to be interviewed. However, he then made contact with the investigating officers and told them he had changed his mind and would agree to answer questions.18 In his evidence before me the offender said that he had no intention of hitting Mr Connolly about the head but he repeated the concession that he intended to harm him and that he was very drunk, angry and reckless.19 The offender claimed in his interview with Ms Duffy in September 2009 that one of the things that Mr Connolly had called out shortly before he went to his unit and attacked him was, “Fuck you Cox, your daughter’s next”. He claimed that it was this that so enraged him. He repeated this claim in his evidence before me. I find it rather surprising that if this was said by Mr Connolly and that it was the cause of the offender’s rage that he did not mention it during the course of his lengthy interview with the police so soon after the events occurred. I do not accept it but I also do not think that anything turns on it.20 Police had been called out to the premises at about 8.30pm on the night in response to a complaint by Mr Connolly that somebody had smashed the front window of his unit. He attributed this to “those cunts next door” but as he did not see who did it the police could take no action. It was noticed, however, that Mr Connolly was intoxicated and difficult to understand. At about 10.00pm a lady who lived across the road called police to report that Mr Connolly’s neighbours were arguing with him and that they had pushed him over. Two officers attended. The offender and another person were identified as the likely perpetrators for what had occurred and it was intended to follow it up in the morning. I am satisfied that this was the incident in which the offender assaulted Mr Connolly.21 A neighbour called the ambulance at about 4.00am. When the officers arrived a very short time later they were told by the neighbour that Mr Connolly had been assaulted about an hour to an hour and a half earlier. The officers found Mr Connolly sitting on the lounge in his unit. He was seriously injured and there was a lot of blood about but he was described as being alert and oriented. He was experiencing breathing difficulties. He was assisted downstairs to the waiting ambulance and there placed on a stretcher. At that point he became agitated and then suddenly passed away. Resuscitation efforts were to no avail. 22 Professor Johan Duflou, forensic pathologist, conducted a post mortem examination from which he concluded that the cause of death was “blunt force head and neck injuries”. He observed multiple lacerations of the face, multiple fractures of the face structures, principally to the teeth and jaw, injury to the small bones of the neck, multiple rib fractures and fracturing of the bones of the hands and forearms. There were also numerous bruises and abrasions. The lungs were full of blood. A toxicology report revealed a blood alcohol level, described by the pathologist as “modest”, of 0.063g/100mL. 23 The offence of murder is obviously serious but I need to make an assessment of where within the range of seriousness of such offences this particular offence lies. I accept that the offender did not intend to kill Mr Connolly but I am satisfied that his intention was to inflict most grievous bodily harm upon him. He became enraged after offensive and abusive comments had been exchanged that included reference to his belief, for which there is no foundation in the evidence, that Mr Connolly was a paedophile. The offender’s choice of a heavy wrench as a weapon and the five to ten blows he struck with it are indicative of the level of his anger and rage. I am satisfied that there was considerable force behind each of the blows. The offender was significantly younger and bigger than Mr Connolly who was 47 years old, 1.75m tall and 66 kg in weight. The offender was 26 years old, 1.85m tall and weighed 85 – 90 kg. Mr Connolly was prone on his lounge and had no chance of defending himself. The attack came as a surprise and occurred in Mr Connolly’s own home after the offender had broken in. On any view, Mr Connolly was the victim of a most savage, brutal and cowardly beating.24 I do not think there is anything specific in the mental state of the offender that is relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence beyond the fact that it was clearly impulsive and not the product of any considered thought. In large part, his mental state – and by that I mean all of the matters that impinged upon the lifestyle he was leading at the time, and had there genesis in the loss of his stepson in 2006 – is a consideration of a subjective nature and is relevant to issues of personal deterrence, rehabilitation and the like.25 It was submitted by Mr Haesler, senior counsel for the offender, that I should find that the offence was below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The Crown Prosecutor did not cavil with that but was more precise in submitting that I should find it was just below that range. Upon a consideration of all of the matters I have just mentioned I have come to the view that the submissions of both counsel should be accepted, that is, that the offence is just below the middle of the range.26 The offender has a criminal history involving convictions for property damage, behaving offensively in public and having custody of an offensive implement in public. It is notable that there are no offences of personal violence. He has not previously been imprisoned. This is a record that is fairly insignificant in the assessment of sentence in the present case. At most, it denies to him any benefit of being regarded as a first offender of prior good character.27 Mr Connolly’s criminal history was included in the material tendered by the Crown. I do not know why. Perhaps it is because it shows that there is nothing in it that would support the offender’s belief that he was a paedophile. 28 On 14 November 2008 the offender was charged with a number of offences including maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. I was informed that he proposes to defend those matters. A question arose as to whether the present sentencing should be deferred until those matters were finalised. If they culminate in sentence(s) having to be imposed there will be a difficulty in accumulating, or partially accumulating upon the sentence I am to impose. I raised the concern that such sentencing might result in the offender having his potential parole period eroded such as occurred in Smale v R [2009] NSWCCA 220. Mr Haesler sought instructions and then confirmed that he wished the present matter to proceed despite the risk that I had adverted to.29 The fact that the offender was on bail in respect of those matters at the time of the offence for which I am to sentence is a serious aggravating feature.30 The offender was held at the Goulburn Correctional Centre up until his arraignment in this Court on 7 August 2009. Whilst at that centre he worked in the cabinet and wood shop. He is presently held at Parklea Correctional Centre where he is working as the librarian. He has hopes of returning to Goulburn as he is due to commence an apprenticeship in cabinet making next January. He is also enrolled in a law course offered by the State Library. 31 He has also been seeing drug and alcohol workers and a psychologist. He has been discussing with the latter his anger management problems. A certificate confirming his completion of a ten session alcohol and other drug relapse prevention course confirms the former.32 He has not had any contact with his children since being in custody. He does have family support. His parents and an aunt were present at the sentence hearing last week. In addition I have received testimonials from his sister, an uncle, an aunt and Mr and Mrs Graham, the parents of his former partner. 33 Psychometric testing by Ms Duffy produced results that she said must be interpreted with caution. She said he answered the questionnaire by extensively exaggerating his symptoms, particularly personal problems and faults. As a result I do not propose to place any weight upon the possible interpretation she offered. I do, however, accept that in the two and half years leading up to the time of the offence the offender had been unable to come to grips with the loss of his stepson, the breakdown of his relationship and his minimal contact with his children. As time went on he lost all care for the future and allowed himself to become lost in a world of daily binge drinking. This compounded a perennial problem of lack of control of his emotions, most particular anger. 34 The offender’s remorse for taking Mr Connolly’s life is not quite complete. He has expressed regret and shame from as early as his interview with the police two days after the event. His evidence before me was that he felt bad for Mr Connolly’s family because they had lost a family member and he felt ashamed for his own family and children. He said it was something that he will live with for the rest of his life and he was prepared to pay for what he did. He concluded his evidence by acknowledging his responsibility generally. At no stage has he expressed any remorse for Mr Connolly himself. What he has acknowledged, however, is sufficient to warrant a finding in his favour under s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 35 The offender did co-operate with the police by offering to be interviewed after an earlier refusal on legal advice. He was frank and forthright in making quite blunt admissions during the course of that interview. 36 His plea of guilty was first entered in the Local Court. For the utilitarian benefit of that plea to the system of justice I will discount the sentence by 25 per cent.37 In terms of rehabilitation, there will obviously be a need for much work to be done by the offender on substance abuse issues, relapse prevention and, most importantly, anger management. Resolving the underlying trauma and grief at the loss of his stepson will be an important component. If these issues are not under control when he is back in the community there is a real danger that he will return to the state he was in as described by Senior Constable Wharffe in his statement that was tendered by the Crown at the invitation of the defence. The officer there said, “Justin Cox had over the past months shown a propensity to violent acts whilst drinking”. The present matter is a demonstration of the danger he presented at that time. 38 The situation is not completely gloomy however. He demonstrated difficulties in controlling his anger in his formative years but in adulthood he did learn to exercise control until the self-destructive downward spiral into which he descended from mid-2006. The fact that his criminal history contains no offences of violence is of some significance. He has demonstrated in the past a good work ethic. The fact that he has been working whilst in custody and also that he has plans to undertake an apprenticeship in cabinet making show some promise for the future. The authors of the various testimonials all express confidence that he can “put his demons to rest”, as one of them put it, and once again become a worthwhile member of the community. My conclusion is that provided he conscientiously engages with counselling and programs to address the issues I have mentioned his rehabilitation prospects are quite good. 39 My finding that the offence fell just below the middle of the range of objective seriousness is a reason for not imposing the standard non-parole period of 20 years. My findings as to the various subjective matters in the offender’s favour, including the discount for the plea of guilty, are further reasons for not doing so. I must, however, keep the prescription of that period as the standard in mind as a benchmark, just as I do the maximum penalty of imprisonment for life.40 I confirm that in sentencing for the offence of murder I have taken into account the offender’s guilt of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.SENTENCE41 Convicted 
     
      
      Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 13 years 6 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 4 years 6 months. The sentence is to commence 2 January 2009.

    42 I dismiss the back-up charge of assault.

   JUDGMENT1. Saripah Syed Basri, (Ms Basri), is charged with importing a commercial quantity of a border control drug namely heroin into Australia on 25 February 2008. Henry Ugo Madubuko, Ifeanyi Okonkwo are each charged with attempting on 25 February 2008 to possess a commercial quantity of heroin unlawfully imported by Ms Basri. 2. All three were tried by a jury in a trial running from 8 October 2008 to 4 November 2008. The jury found each guilty on 4 November 2008. There is an unfortunate delay of nearly one year between verdict and sentence. Hearing on sentence had been scheduled during this time and I was desirous of dealing with the three offenders together. For one reason or another the hearings had to be adjourned consequently the setting of dates required accommodation for four counsel and the trial judge. 3. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentences for these offences before this court, committed by these offenders. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to each offender called subjective matters. The starting point requires the sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the court relating to the offence and to the offender.4. My fact-finding task necessarily requires me to find facts consistent with and reflective of the jury’s verdicts. There is no obligation to find facts at either extreme of favourability or un-favourability to the accused. Thus in determining the facts of the case I am mindful of the jury’s verdict and the evidence before the court upon which those verdicts were determined. None of the offenders gave evidence before the jury thus the facts to be found against each offender will necessarily be found from material in the Crown case against each accused. 5. My own view of the appropriate findings of fact from the evidence properly before the jury will be my guideline or my guide to the facts that I determine.Facts6. The heroin imported into Australia by Ms Basri was packaged and concealed in a suitcase and trusted to her care in India by an Indian based drug syndicate. Ms Basri was recruited from Malaysia. She stayed some eleven days in India with a lady by the name of Gina and her boyfriend Johnnie both of whom would appear to be members of an Indian based drug syndicate. Johnnie is Nigerian. They were based in Delhi in India. Ms Basri’s ticket to India had been obtained by services of a middle man, she travelled to Delhi on 14 February departing there on 24 February. During her stay in India most if not all was spent in contact with Gina and Johnnie. An Australian visa was issued to her twelve days before she came to Australia. It is difficult to imagine the visa could have been obtained without access to her passport and signature. There is certainly no evidence before me suggesting she did not participate in obtaining the Australian visa. 7. The account given in her interview seeks to establish her trip to Delhi was for the purpose of joining a business where she would take Sari material and Punjabi suits to Malaysia where Gina’s cousin would distribute them. It was only after some days she was asked if she would deliver, she says, sari’s to Gina’s brother in Australia. In either case it is not explained in the evidence why the saris could not have been packaged and freighted to the relevant destination at a fraction the cost. She was to remain in Australia she was told for two or three days and then return to Malaysia. 8. This account in her interview must have been rejected by the jury, it is not difficult to see why. Her Australian visa was issued within a short time of her arrival in Delhi. Further, the account in the interview does not see the offender with any work to do in Malaysia with Punjabi suits or saris once the delivery to Australia has been completed. The significance of this is she does not appear on her account to have complained to Gina about her lost opportunity to work for Gina in Malaysia which was the whole purpose of her trip to India. She told Probation and Parole she was motivated to travel to India by the lure or promise of $4,000 Malay per week. That promise does not seem to be the subject of any subsequent challenge by her or substituted promise by them for going to Australia and losing access to the Malay business, apparently.9. Further I have assumed she was on a tourist visa. If so would not that require an ongoing destination from Australia; that destination could have easily been Malay or return to India. The evidence disclosed it was a return to India. The giving US of a $1,000 for purchasing a one way ticket in Australia appears an absolute waste of money when the ongoing ticket to Malaysia could have been purchased in India for less, that is from Sydney to Malaysia purchased in India.10. I am satisfied Ms Basri well knew she was couriering illicit contraband into Australia. The identity of the contraband as heroin may not have been made clear to her. I accept she checked the relevant luggage before she left India. I find that she knew there was substance concealed in the lining and sari’s within the suitcase as providing a plausible excuse for her bringing the bag into Australia. I am, as was the jury, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt her importing of an unspecified substance was intentional. I am also satisfied, as was the jury, that she was aware of a substantial risk that the substance was a border control drug and having regard to the circumstances as she knew them to be it was unjustifiable for her to take that risk. 11. I am fortified in that finding by her travelling with two sim cards for her phone one an international sim card dedicated for international calls at a cheaper rate. It carried it’s own phone number; it was provided by and to give Johnnie and Gina phone access to her on a phone number different from her own phone number thereby making detection of the Indian based syndicate more problematic for the authorities. 12. It was Ms Basri’s account, she was directed not to phone Johnnie or Gina and to delete all phone numbers in the memory an hour before leaving Mumbai. Those arrangements if they be accurately recorded by her are only consistent with all future contact with Johnnie and Gina being terminated. In those circumstances the unexplained loss of engagement in the Sari and Punjabi suit business in Malaysia without complaint by her makes that supposed reason for the initial contact so hollow as to be extremely dubious. Frankly her narrative to the police does not survive analysis.13. What did not come out in the trial but has come out subsequently is that she was in fact in contact with Gina before she left Malaysia. When seized, the admixture in the suitcase was 3.04 kilograms. Upon analysis the admixture was found to contain 1.88 kilograms of pure heroin. The admixture was assessed as being 61.8 per cent pure heroin. 14. Upon her arrest Ms Basri co-operated with the police. As the evidence in the trial unfolded it became clear, police had prior intelligence indicating the unlawful arrival of the border control substance and the identity of Ms Basri as the person in whose custody that item would be when imported into Australia. 15. Customs and police quickly identified the bag after it was unloaded from the plane but prior to its arrival in the custom’s hall. She was arrested whilst waiting in vain for her bag at the luggage carousel in the custom’s hall. Once arrested she agreed to assist Federal police in a controlled delivery of the trolley suitcase to those who were sent by the drug syndicate to collect it from her. She was afforded the status of a “protected person” for the purpose of undertaking this controlled delivery. 16. The jury by its verdict found that both Okonkwo and Madubuko were jointly involved in attempting to retrieve the illegally imported heroine. Ms Basri, together with the trolley bag now containing a substitute packet of inert substance or the packet of heroin it previously contained, was conveyed by police to the Travelodge Motel/Hotel at Bankstown. She had been in phone or SMS contact with Johnnie or Gina on a number of occasions since her arrival and indeed since her arrest. 17. Madubuko and Okonkwo were in the area of the Travelodge. She had been told by Johnnie after she arrived at the Kingsford Smith Airport that there were “two black guys supposed to be meeting [her]”. These instructions would appear to differ from her account that she was supposed to give the contents of the suitcase to Gina’s brother or cousin. Gina was described as possibly Chinese. It is likely Ms Basri would have assumed Gina’s brother to be of a similar ethnicity to her (Gina). 18. By 5.30pm or so the Australian Federal police had Ms Basri in room 415 at Bankstown Travelodge. There were a number of phone calls made by her. By 7pm with her trolley suitcase she made her way to level 1 in the hotel’s car park. Okonkwo and Madubuko are both Nigerian. Because of their skin colour and the message re “two black guys” they were obviously persons of interest to the police in the area. Both were seen to be using their mobile phones. Ms Basri left the car park and hotel, met and conversed with Okonkwo and Madubuko, followed them for a short period, they stopped, she further conversed with Madubuko, then continued on with Madubuko, it would seem to the motor vehicle that was owned by Okonkwo. Meanwhile Okonkwo left them, apparently to attend an ATM machine for cash.19. Some thirty minutes later Madubuko and Okonkwo were arrested leaving the parking spot they had secured on Chapel Road. Okonkwo was driving his Lancer, Madubuko was seated in the passenger seat. In the boot of this car was the controlled delivery suitcase. Madubuko was searched and found upon his person were one thousand US dollars. Two mobile phones were found under the passenger seat, one of them had an SMS message “No room 415” and had come from an Indian based mobile phone. 20. The jury must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each of Madubuko and Okonkwo attempted intentionally to possess an illicit substance believing it to be a border controlled drug which they knew would be passed over to them by a courier who was acting on directions of someone in India. I am also satisfied each knew it had arrived in Australia very recently and most likely that day. 21. All parties co-operated in the trial with the prosecution by compiling and agreeing to a seventeen paragraph agreed facts pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act. In my experience three accused litigants agreeing to such a statement is unique. It certainly had a significant value to the conduct of the trial, in particular reducing the required number of witnesses considerably, the number of issues the Crown had to formally approve, the length of the trial considerably and issues the jury had to evaluate from competing evidence and contested evidence considerably. 22. These gains to the trial present as worthwhile contributions to the administration of criminal justice. Hopefully the initiative taken by defence counsel in this trial will become a template or pathfinder for other defence counsel. 23. Since writing the above I have now read exhibit B3, record of interview with Federal agent, Tim Rose dated 8 January 2009. The subject of the interview was, of course, Ms Basri. In that interview Ms Basri admits to communicating with the Indian female on the internet who told her she had vacancies and gave her a phone number. I am satisfied telephone communication with Gina by Ms Basri followed.  Objective Criminality24. From the facts as he finds them to be, a sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences before the court as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of these offenders. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in this trial with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences is evaluated. 25. Objective criminality has an important impact, indeed the most important impact, upon the overall sentencing outcome. The importation of illicit drugs into Australia should be seen as an offence against the public health. My understanding is that all heroin in Australia is here as a consequence of importation. Courts have long recognised that in assessing the objective seriousness of a drug offence, it is necessary to have regard to that drug’s potential for harm. I am satisfied the heroin was imported with a view to it being distributed on the illegal drug market for financial reward. 26. Drug dealing is harmful to the community by those who purchase drugs. It also has an indirect impact upon the community at large. Drug distribution is anti-social because it is a crime against public health. Importation of illegal drugs, not otherwise available in Australia, is a first step in their illegal distribution into this country. 27. For some, if not most, drugs such as heroin are addictive. Some are destructive of, or contributing to mental health problems Supplying drugs leads to or sustains drug addicts. Drug addicts are human beings whose capacity to function and feel human is smothered to a greater or lesser extent by addiction and the other effects of drugs. That is the real essence of the criminal harm done by those who supply drugs and who rely upon importers. That is, in a greater or lesser way, the disenabling of other human beings is accomplished by those who deal in or traffic in drugs. 28. Heroin as I mentioned earlier is a particularly addictive form of drug. The weight of the heroin amounted to 1.88 kilograms. The marketable quantity of heroin is set at 2 grams. The commercial quantity is one that commences at a threshold of 1.5 kilos. 1.88 kilos is 380 grams above the commercial quantity threshold or roughly 33% more than the commercial threshold. Clearly the actual quantity of pure heroin imported increases the potential for harm.29. I do not have before me evidence of any range of street deals that would be available from this quantity of heroin but it must be considerable. The present quantities 1.88 kilograms would need to be cut into quantities available to on-suppliers. There is a substantial potential for harm to health of a substantial number of persons. From the perspective of the Indian drug syndicate, this enterprise is motivated by financial greed. 30. The Indian drug syndicate presents as sophisticated in terms of the size of its operation, the presentation of heroin for importation purposes by which I mean the skill in merging it into the unsighted area of a suitcase and the organisation is sophisticated in its systems of protecting itself from detection.31. Ms Basri was the courier whose responsibility was to shepherd this contraband from India to Bankstown for on-delivery to the tentacles of the Sydney-based distribution network. So far as is known, her reward included a twelve day stay in India, a trip to Australia, stay here for three or four days and US $500. She was tasked with monitoring the progress of the illicit importation and reporting back to Johnnie and Gina. She was also required to contact them on arrival to receive delivery instructions. It was, of course, as part of her task, to notify them of disaster or danger to the product.32. Okonkwo and Madubuko were the first point of distribution in Sydney. Precisely what that means in the context of this case is unclear. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that either was the principal point of contact in Australia although I confess some suspicions. Obviously I cannot act on them. The giving of $1000 to Madubuko is capable of several interpretations with some or all of it for him, with some or all of it for Okonkwo. Was it seeding money or was it their payment for taking the contraband to the next link in the distribution chain. I am satisfied the decision for the two men to come to Bankstown was made after Ms Basri left Delhi. 33. The evidence suggests it is likely Okonkwo was the late inclusion although that is rather speculative, but frankly in the absence of evidence, I cannot be satisfied on the balance of probability that this is so.34. Likewise it is likely both mobile phones found in the vehicle belonged to Madubuko as they were found under the passenger seat. Again, in the absence of evidence, I am unable to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that they did not belong to Okonkwo.35. Thus each is left with the liability that falls to them as a consequence of their being involved in a joint venture. Acts done associated with a joint venture create equal liability for each accused.36. The travelling to the pick-up site, the collection of the assumed contraband, the placing of it in the getaway vehicle and the setting out to deliver the contraband to the next phase of its Australian journey, coupled with the phone calls made to and received by whoever it was that contacted India, fall equally on both males. Neither of them can be found, on the evidence before me, as an initiator of, or facilitator for, the distribution of heroin into the Australian community. 37. I note once the heroin was seized, the potential for real harm to the community ceased to be a reality. In that sense the criminality associated with the importation must be less than an importation which is consumed into actual delivery of drugs into the community. The tariffs for importation cases, where the potential for harm has been frustrated, establish that the benefit accruing to offenders in such circumstances is marginal.38. Defence counsel for Ms Basri submitted she presented as having a vulnerable person profile. Police identified features of such a profile as including females being overweight, of low income and of poor personal esteem. To that profile one could also add of poor education. The difficulty, however, with the submission is that on her own account she instigated the contact with Gina and Johnnie. She travelled to India, she participated almost immediately upon her arrival for an Australian visa, whatever had enticed her to India, within hours of her arrival if not before she knew she was going to Australia. It is unlikely she would have been taken to India by the drug syndicate if she had not already agreed to travel from there to Australia. It makes no sense from the point of view of the Indian-based drug syndicate for her to be taken to India from Malaysia to be screened there. 39. There is no evidence she was targeted. On her account she responded to some enticement to travel to India. On her account it was saris back to Malaysia. 40. Absent evidence of actual targeting by the drug syndicate, I am really unable to determine what motivated her. I have already indicated I regard her evidence as unreliable especially her evidence that she was tricked. But the circumstances by which arrangements were made for her to come to Australia as set out by her in her account have already been discounted.41. A proper evaluation of the objective criminality leads to the inescapable conclusion that all of these offences are sufficiently serious as to require substantial sentences of full-time custody. SHORT ADJOURNMENT42. I turn now to review the subjective factors for each of the offenders. I am both entitled and required to do this. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence each has committed, but also I am sentencing each particular offender for it. Each offender coming before the court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence, circumstances personal to this offender may offer to the court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by an offender or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate.Saripah Basri – Family Dynamics, Personal Background, Relationships43. Miss Basri was born in Malaysia thirty-nine years ago. Her mother married five times and most of her children were fostered out. Miss Basri was fostered to her grandmother when aged twelve months. She was subject to physical abuse from her grandfather. He would strike her on her head and body. He would heat up a piece of metal and burn her ears with it. She was made to spend time studying the Koran daily. She ran away on occasions but was returned to the same grandparents. She was raped by a neighbour, ran away and was returned to her grandparents home. For a while she lived with her mother; then she was required to rise early and bake cakes for the market. Both parents are now deceased. At fifteen she was subject to an arranged marriage, gave birth to the first of her eight children at the age of eighteen. Their ages range from nine to twenty. She claims when she left Malaysia she only intended to be away for a week and left the children in the care of relatives. She and her husband separated in 2005 but remained, as it were, in the same premises. That marriage was marked by violence. She left the house she shared with her husband in 2007.Education, Employment and Skills44. She says her schooling was, “inconsistent” by which she appears to mean unstable. In some years she would go to four different schools. She held employment in a video parlour game as a security officer, sales assistant and despatch officer.General Health45. Much of her life she has been subject to physical abuse, some of it severe. Miss Pullman, who prepared a personal/psychological profile at the request of the defence, was of opinion she may have suffered some level of traumatic brain injury with long lasting sequale.46. I have viewed Miss Pullman’s report with some caution for reasons I will explain shortly. She experiences headaches, osteoporosis, back pain, poor vision in left eye and loss of hearing in the left ear. One can not rule out that the majority of these symptoms have their origin in physical attacks upon her head.Mental Health47. She reported symptoms of depression. One would hazard a guess that the depression may have been reactive to her current situation in gaol and also reactive to the unfortunate life she had experienced thus far. She is reported to have low self-esteem. Her intellectual functioning gauged upon the tests conducted by Miss Pullman that the offender was able to complete is assessed as being in the extremely low range and the eighth percentile.48. Although it may be difficult for a judicial officer to accurately assess within the context of trial and the use of interpreter, I would not accept that her presentation revealed an intellect impoverishment to that extent. In so saying I would not want it thought I viewed her as being anything other than intellectually impoverished at some level. I have reservations based on her presentations, albeit in compromised circumstances, that her level of impoverishment is so extreme. She was able to give Miss Pullman and to Therese Sartor from Probation and Parole, what appeared to be detailed and consistent histories. Her ability to record short passages of new auditory information appeared intact. She was able to express anxiety about her situation in court, which anxiety had its origins in assisting police at Bankstown in a controlled delivery.49. She was able to travel independently to India, Rio De Janeiro and to Australia and to Spain. She was aware her luggage was missing and able to communicate to someone at a time when her luggage had not appeared both by way of telephone and, it would seem, to another person in the Customs Hall.50. She is aware of where her children are and is appropriately concerned that she is unable to care for them, understanding that would be causing her grief. She was able to recall to Probation and Parole explicit detail of the advertisement she said she answered that saw her travel from Malaysia to India. All of those functions are well above the capacity of those unfortunate to function at the eighth percentile of intellectual functioning.51. I am fortified in this finding by the absence of any comment from the PSR author as to any compromised intellectual functioning which I would have expected had there been any noticeable to her.Drugs and Alcohol52. Miss Basri denies any history of drug or alcohol abuse. She does not smoke cigarettes.Character53. Aged forty-eight with difficult childhood which led into a difficult marriage, she has been out of criminal trouble in her home country. She presents as having a good ethic in circumstances where she was also raising eight children. About one month before leaving India she was involved in divorce proceedings in the Malay judicial system.Attitude to Offence54. Her case was that she did not have the requisite criminal knowledge. There was no denial of the importation or of the nature or quantity of the drug. No allegations were made against police conduct. As I earlier remarked she was party to an agreed set of facts that sought to isolate the issues to be determined by the jury to one of criminal knowledge.55. That the Commonwealth Crown felt it necessary to prove some agreed matters was a matter for him; it is a well-known and recognised feature of Commonwealth jury trials that evidence from several sources will be harnessed to prove a single and sometimes minor proposition “for the sake of completeness”.56. Since her conviction she has maintained she lacked the requisite knowledge. Subject to that caveat, she claimed awareness that drugs cause considerable harm to family and community generally. She stated she was sorry for her involvement. 57. While I am conscious the jury and I find against her on the knowledge issue, I accept that the human psyche is capable of experiencing more than one conflicting feelings on the same issue. Such contrition as she has, is thus made imperfect, but I accept that it exists at some level. This finding is, I note, consistent with my finding that she functions at a higher intellectual level than Miss Pullman opines.Cooperation with Police58. I have referred to the fact that she assisted police in the investigation stages of this matter immediately after her arrest. There can be no doubt that had she refused to do so neither of the male defendants would have been at trial. Her service to the administration of justice on this account is important. It is also a matter I am required to take into account in a substantial way by virtue of 16A(h)(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cwh). 59. I have read the interview between Ms Basri and the Australian Federal Police agents on 8 January 2009 (exhibit 3). The interview in terms of any assistance to police has not been assessed in evidence before me by them. So far as I can assess there may have been a fact or two emerging from that interview that could have been added to the AFP intelligence database, otherwise there would appear to be no value from the interview. If her intention in doing the interview was to demonstrate cooperation with the police, it backfired. I am satisfied when questioned about her own situation in regards to this offence she was unreliable and on occasions deliberately deceptive. The only credit for which she is entitled to some mitigation, by virtue of her cooperation with the police, occurs on 25 February 2008.Rehabilitation60. It is most unlikely Ms Basri will ever offend against an Australian law in future. Her prospects of rehabilitation would be assessed as high. She has family ties in Malaysia, no prior criminal history there, and will have strong personal deterrence as a consequence of her period in incarceration. What Effect Will Custody Have on Third Parties61. I am satisfied no third party in Australia is impacted by Ms Basri being in custody. Her return to Malaysia will necessarily be delayed. Her continued absence will impact on her children. In that sense one anticipates they will miss her and the quality of care she gives to them. But it would seem they are being cared for by others. The quality of that care is not in evidence before me. OkonkwoFamily Dynamics, Personal Background, Relationships 62. Ifeanyi Okonkwo is forty-five years old, a separated man with two children - a daughter aged eleven, son aged nine - living in Nigeria. He is the eldest of nine children. He maintains contact with his aged father. His mother is deceased. He has been in Australia for some eight or so years, having overstayed on a tourist visa. He came for the Olympic Games. He is currently holding a criminal justice visa.63. In Australia he formed a relationship with a girlfriend who is supportive of him even whilst he has been in custody. His family in Nigeria were poor.  Education Skills and Employment64. He had difficulty obtaining employment in Australia. His application for refugee status was rejected. In 2001 he obtained employment as an unskilled labourer, was injured in 2002 (rotor cuff injury). At the time of his arrest his income stream was $705 per fortnight by way of Workers’ Compensation. He is currently taking antiinflammatory medication. He completed his schooling in Nigeria aged fourteen and worked as a salesman dealing in building materials (plumbing) for six years. He began his own building material business which he ran until attending the Sydney Olympic Games. 65. He has undertaken courses whilst in custody in public speaking(?) and obtained his Certificate III in Employment, Education and Training. Between July 2008 and May 2009 he obtained nine certificates in religious studies from the Emmaus Correspondence School. He was associated with the Nigerian Sydney soccer team as one of that team’s coaches from 2001. He was also associated with the Igbo Cultural Dance Group of New South Wales. General Health66. He had had an operation to the right shoulder as a consequence of the work injury earlier mentioned. He has been diagnosed in custody as having an enlarged heart and hepatitis.Mental Health67. Apart from some counselling following his employment injury, and a history of depression, there appear to be no other mental health issues. Because of a past history of depression he came into custody with a mandatory risk intervention team assessment. He has received counselling on reception into custody. When interviewed by Dr Westmore, a psychiatrist for the defence, he denied major depressive illness. Dr Westmore diagnoses that depression as being in remission.Drugs and Alcohol68. He denies using illicit drugs or abusing alcohol.Character69. The offender has never previously been in trouble with the law in Australia or Nigeria. He has remained in Australia after his tourist visa expired and after his refugee application was refused. Otherwise so far as respect for government requirements, there appears to be no criticism. 70. As the father of two children he was sending money to Nigeria for their support. He keeps in phone contact with his aged father. There are references, several of them, which make clear he was making major contributions to the African and particularly Nigerian community in Sydney through sport, cultural dancing and his church community. The references make mention of his generosity of time to handle church equipment, organise events, coach soccer, interact with the parish children. A number of his referees described this offending conduct as being entirely out of character for him.71. I have already noted he has been attending courses whilst in custody. Since writing this, by consent of the Crown, more certificates of courses completed have been tendered. He has attended four Certificate I and II courses including Spoken and Written English, Skills for Work Training. There is also evidence he is employed whilst in custody since July 2008. Cooperation with the Police72. Once arrested, he complied with police orders. He exercised his right to silence at the investigation stage which cannot be used adversely to him. There is no other area in which he has assisted police.Attitude to Offence73. He disagreed with the police facts he told Probation and Parole. The account he gave to the author of the pre-sentence report was that he was with a friend who asked for a lift to Bankstown. He drove his friend there. There were mobile phone conversations between the friend and other persons. Ultimately the friend met a woman, the two of them greeted each other. The friend walked towards where the car was, the woman followed pulling her suitcase. Okonkwo said he left to attend an ATM, returned to the car, the woman left. His friend had the suitcase which was then placed in the boot. They drove off and very shortly thereafter were arrested. He still maintains he is innocent.74. While there was no onus on him at trial to prove anything that version was not before the jury by way of direct sworn evidence. On the evidence before them the jury were not prepared to draw the inferences necessary to raise any reasonable doubt. As matters stand, he claims he is innocent.Rehabilitation Prospects75. Notwithstanding the absence of expressed contrition there appears to be good prospects of rehabilitation. There is no other offending in his forty-five year history, he has been conscientious whilst in custody advancing his level of education and fitness for future job opportunities. He has strong community support in Australia; while that support will not transfer to Nigeria should he be sent there or return there, as seems likely, the skills and attitudes he has developed that created that level of community support are likely to transfer well to his homeland. In Nigeria he has family support. Probable Effect of Sentence on Third Parties76. I am satisfied the custody of the offender does not effect any person in Australia. There is evidence which I accept Okonkwo was sending some portion of his compensation payments to support his children. On the evidence before me I am unable to determine what has happened to his compensation payments whilst he is in custody therefore I am unable to determine what if any effect his custody has upon the income stream that was flowing to someone on behalf of care of his children. I imagine phone communication with his father and children is less than otherwise would be. 77. There is no evidence to suggest one way or the other whether his custodial situation has been conveyed to any family members in Nigeria. Custody will necessarily delay his return to Nigeria assuming he accepts deportation, and therefore to his family. MadubukoFamily Dynamics, Personal Background, Relationships78. Madubuko was born in Nigeria forty-four years ago. He is one of two siblings raised in a supportive family environment. However, his schooling was interrupted during his teenage years on account of his father’s illness. One of the consequences of the father’s diabetes was the amputation of both legs. The family financial situation thereafter was impacted by the loss of the main income earner. It affected his family and saw Madubuko loaded with new responsibilities. Those new responsibilities led to isolation from his peer group. His father passed away in the early 1990’s, shortly thereafter Madubuko moved from the village to the city looking for employment, apparently only with sporadic success.79. In 2003 he arrived in Australia, aged thirty-nine, probably on a tourist visa. In any event his status became unlawful non-citizen having negative employment implications for him. He formed a relationship in June 2007 with his current partner. He claims the relationship is positive and supportive. He claims a social network in Sydney. He entertains an intention of residing in the Bankstown area upon release. No doubt the Immigration Department is reviewing his file to see whether that dream is realistic or otherwise. Education, Skills and Employment80. He attended school in Nigeria, leaving in his teenage years. He later obtained his school certificate as a mature age student. He claims his literacy skills are satisfactory. In Australia he has worked in casual positions, the frequency of work, and no doubt of employers, will have varied.General Health81. For reasons that have not been explained he has shoulders that dislocate easily. Whether this is a consequence of sporting or work injury or some idiosyncratic condition is unclear, otherwise he appears in reasonable physical health for a forty-four year old man.Mental Health Issues82. There is no evidence upon which any mental health insight can be based.Drugs and Alcohol83. He denies any history of drug addiction. He consumes alcohol on occasions perhaps two times weekly, drinking heavily, four to six bottles (I have assumed 750ml). There have been periods of greater alcohol consumption but at the time of his arrest it had decreased because of concerns he had that it was affecting his physical health. He has never sought professional help in respect of drinking and it would seem never felt the need to do so. Character84. So far as is known he is a person without prior convictions. While he may have had a good start in life, during his father’s illness matters became more difficult, he left school early and sought employment in the city without much success. He blames the uncertain economic conditions in Nigeria for this. He visited Australia and stayed with consequent employment problems as a consequence of his immigration status. 85. There has been no career path for him. To his credit he obtained a school certificate at a mature age. There are no institutional charges against him nor has he presented in custody with any behavioural issues.Attitude to Offence86. He told Probation and Parole the jury reached the wrong verdict. He acknowledged presence at the scene, apparently including being with Okonkwo and in Okonkwo’s car. He disputes an observation by the pre-sentence report author that “he did not have any knowledge of the suitcase or its contents”. It would appear he lacks acceptance of, and insight to, his offending conduct.Rehabilitation Prospects87. It is more difficult to assess this offender’s rehabilitation prospects. He claims support in Australia, his partner. He has he says a social network. His contact with persons, if it be his contact, associated with the Indian based drug network remain unexplained. His motivation for being involved and his level of involvement in this offence remain unexplained. His work history and income stream appear less certain. On the other hand this is his first offence in forty-four years, there are no institutional charges against him, nor has he presented in custody with behavioural issues. I would assess his rehabilitation prospects as probably positive. Cooperation with Police88. Once arrested there is no issue but he obeyed all police requests. He has exercised his right to silence and that will play no real part in the sentencing disposition but for his cooperation in the sense of behavioural cooperation with the police, there is no other real assistance given to the police.Impact of the Sentence on Third Parties89. On the evidence before the court his custodial sentence will impact upon his partner who will be without his presence, company and support in Australia. So far as I can tell no other person of importance within his social network will be seriously effected. 90. I come now to general comments.Personal Deterrence91. In respect of each offender, the sentence under consideration for that offender will be sufficient to constitute powerful personal deterrence. 92. Section 16A(3) Crimes Act 1914 requires a court to regard the nature and severity of the conditions that may be imposed upon or applied to an offender under the sentence to be imposed. Each offender will be held in a secure single sex environment for the duration of the non-parole period. Each one’s capacity to make decision or choices concerning herself or himself is necessarily severely compromised. Each one’s capacity to chose the company he or she will keep is severely compromised. Contact with persons beyond the prison walls is compromised. Persons speaking the language of their origin, that is of the origin of the offenders and coming from their culture will be few. Indeed, so far as the Nigerians are concerned, I imagine very few. There is a high level of violence and noise or shouting and iron doors and bolts closing and opening. While there may be employment facilities, they are poorly paid and would depend upon whether the correctional institution in which an offender is housed maintains an employment program. Likewise education programs are at the whim of the custodial system. Prisoners are frequently required to spend inordinate times in their cells in an unproductive, mind-numbing and lonely environment.Setting the Sentences93. The case law in s 16A(1) makes plain the court must impose a sentence that is of severity appropriate in all the circumstances. I regard the purpose of s 16A(3) to which I have just referred, as requiring the judge imposing a sentence of full time prison to recognise imprisonment must be, because of its nature and severity, a sentence of last resort.94. Nevertheless the case law also makes clear that in the circumstances of this case full-time custodial sentences are called for. The provision of a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for all of these offences before the court, makes clear general deterrence must be a factor playing some part in the sentencing determination. 95. Section 16A(2)(a) - (c) require the court to assess the nature and circumstances of the offence and the role each offender played in it. That requires an assessment of what each actually did and if possible where each fitted within the framework of the structural make up of the group, if there be one, that was responsible for the offence being committed.96. I have described Ms Basri’s role as the courier who’s responsibility it was to shepherd the heroin from India to Bankstown for on delivery to the tentacles of the Sydney distribution network of the organisation. In that role she was required to report the progress and presumably any problems associated with it, as the heroin journeyed from India to Bankstown.97. Okonkwo and Madubuko were the first point of contact with the distribution network. I indicated I was unable to determine on the evidence whether either was a principal or overseer of the distribution, frankly it is unlikely. The Crown case against Madubuko and Okonkwo was a joint venture to collect the contraband. The jury must have accepted that proposition beyond reasonable doubt to have found both guilty. The Crown sought to argue Madubuko’s role in the attempt possession was the greater, that would be true if the evidence satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt that the phones found under his seat were in his custody. From that would spring findings that he was the person making contact with India and received a copy of the SMS text originally sent by Ms Basri. There is no point in having a standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt for fact finding adverse to an accused and then applying a lessor standard.98. Determining who had custody of the evidence laden mobile phone appears a classic “Filippetti” conundrum (Filippetti 13 A Crim R 335). The vehicle was Okonkwo’s, the seat under which they were found, had last been used by Madubuko. It is possible they were deposited, indeed probable they were deposited when the men were confronted with an arrest situation. In those circumstances albeit it with slightly different reasoning either Madubuko or Okonkwo could have deposited the phones there. The other seriously incriminating evidence of Madubuko is his possession of the US one thousand dollars. There is no explanation in the trial evidence as to why he received the money. The trial evidence does disclose a late announcement from India to Ms Basri that “two black guys” would be collecting the suitcase. There is hearsay evidence from Ms Basri’s January interview that the US $1000 was to be divided between the two. While that is not evidence in the sentence proceedings against Madubuko or Okonkwo, its importance is to remind me that drawing conclusions of fact adverse to Madubuko from evidence, must be a justified conclusion of fact. I am not prepared to find the $1000 was intended for Madubuko alone, otherwise that would seem to suggest the other member of the joint venture Okonkwo, was to go unrewarded by the Indian based drug syndicate for providing the car and the support to Madubuko that comes from personal presence.99. In assessing then the significance of Madubuko and Okonkwo to the Indian based drug syndicate or an independent Australian distribution network, it is important to attach significance to the distribution of the reward coming from India. Ms Basri received the Indian base journey, the trip to Sydney and four day stay, return air fare to India and US$500. Madubuko and Okonkwo it would seem shared US $1000 between them. Their rewards appears significantly less than that allocated to Ms Basri. That would be consistent with their task being less demanding and less risky than hers. On the evidence before me I am prepared to find that neither Madubuko nor Okonkwo was a lieutenant in the Indian based drug syndicate.100. Such a finding would have to be made beyond reasonable doubt. I cannot make it. It appears I am left with the fact that they have been recruited for the transfer of the heroin from Bankstown to those who were charged with responsibility of distributing it in Sydney. On the evidence before me I am unable to determine whether the distribution was being undertaken by the Indian based drug syndicate for itself or for some independent Australian group, who purchased from India on condition of delivery being to the front door of the distribution network.101. The criminality of Madubuko and Okonkwo is therefore limited to the acceptance of a suitcase from Ms Basri for delivery to the door of the distribution network and all steps taken by them incidental to that function including the phone contacts. I cannot, however, saddle them with any knowledge or consequence of any phone calls prior to Bankstown. What was contained within the telephone and its use prior to Bankstown was not part of the joint venture. On that view the criminality is equal to each other and aggravated by their being in company; but overall less than Ms Basri’s. 102. The case law makes clear that a further factor to be taken into account is the quantity of drugs. The threshold for this charge of commercial quantity is 1.5 kilograms of pure heroin (314.1 Criminal Code Act 1995). That, of course, sits within the benchmark above the marketable quantity; the maximum penalty of life imprisonment as against twenty-five years for the maximum quantity also takes into account this increased threshold. The quantity of pure heroin was 1.88 kilos; that is, one-third kilogram higher than the threshold.103. A commercial quantity would embrace shipments of tens of kilos, perhaps even hundreds of kilos more than the quantity I am concerned with. In those circumstances the quantity I am concerned with is certainly in the lower reaches of the commercial quantity. 104. Okonkwo and Madubuko are charged with attempt; the same maximum penalty applies to attempts. At common law attempts have generally been regarded as less serious than the consummated offence. The measure of seriousness was the steps taken by an offender to complete the offending conduct. In this case both offenders took all steps necessary to complete the crime of possessing heroin. On that measure their criminality would have to be assessed as though they had actually possessed the heroin. However, on another measure the potential for harm arising from their criminal conduct, the criminality is not as great. My memory of the authorities so far as drug importation and possession is concerned is that less weight than usual is given to this aspect. I note, however, that some weight, although not much, will be given. 105. Because of police intervention, the potential for harm to the community was avoided. While it is true neither male offender knew this, objectively the offence could not be as serious as one where the heroin was successfully retrieved and let us say they had succeeded in delivering it. 106. The personal circumstances of Madubuko and Okonkwo are not so different as to require any differing mitigation of penalty. Okonkwo’s subjective features present him in a slightly better light by comparison to Madubuko, but the differentiation is not so substantial as to require adjustment to the parity principle. 107. The personal circumstances of Ms Basri include her post-arrest participation in the control of delivery. There was a further meeting between her and the police which may at best have added one or two facts to their institutional intelligence data. She will be given a thirty per cent discount on a sentence I otherwise would have passed but for her participation in the control of delivery. I have not added anything for her interview with police in January 2009. 108. Concerning the sentences I also take into account the cooperation of the parties with the prosecution in reaching an agreed statement of facts earlier referred to. Some adjustment downward to the sentence is made on that account. In setting the sentences I have also relied upon the JIRS statistics in respect of both cocaine and heroin imports captured by s 307.1 Criminal Code Act 1995. The number of cases revealed by those statistics are so limited that one cannot with any confidence establish the full range of sentencing for a commercial quantity of heroin although it is likely it is the upper regions of the range that are yet to be filled in. 109. I have also paid some regard to sentences and remarks made in Taha NSW CCA 18.2.1990 on a plea of guilty for a professional courier expecting significant reward; Taha (2.234 kilos); Pang (1999) 105 A Crim R 474 (2.495 kilos), a plea of guilty, courier, some assistance police; Hashmi NSW CCA [439] 13.8.1999 (1.88 grams pure), courier, needed money, assistance fifty per cent discount; Ghale (37) NSW CCA [249] 7.7.2000 - I cannot remember the quantity of drugs, but I will put in the remarks if they need to be printed – Chua (28) NSW CCA [50] 2.3.2001, courier (1.9264 kilograms). All those cases were concerned with the importation of heroin. I have also had regard to Markar [2000] NSWCCA 72, an attempt to possess(2.635 kilograms). 110. The starting point for Ms Basri’s sentence will be seven and a half years. A discount of thirty per cent reduces that figure by two years and three months, leaving her overall sentence to be one of five years and three months. The non parole period will be three years and three months.111. The sentences for each of Madubuko and Okonkwo will be six years and six months, with a non parole period of four years and two months. Notwithstanding that their criminality is less, the discount of thirty per cent has brought the sentence of Ms Basri below theirs. Sentences will date from the date of their arrest of 25 February 2008. 112. I note the time is 4.30pm, I can also note and for me to explain the figures in the JIRS statistics would take another 10 or 15 minutes, I will include that in the judgment, I will be put that in square brackets so that it is clear that while I had it here, I did not orally deliver it, but it will explain at least for those who are prepared to accept it in any other place, how I got to where I am, if they are prepared to accept it. (Material referred to by HH has been mislaid)113. Ms Basri, would you stand up please. Ms Basri, you are convicted that you on 25 February at Sydney, New South Wales, did import a substance, the substance being a border control drug, namely heroin, and the quantity imported being a commercial quantity, for that offence, you are sentenced to a sentence of five years and three months, to date from 25 February 2008 and to expire on 24 February 2013. Your non-parole period is one of three years and three months, which will expire on 24 May 2011. 114. Mr Madubuko and Mr Okonkwo, would each of you stand up. Henry Madubuko and Ifeanyi Fidel Okonkwo, each of you is convicted that you on 25 February 2008 at Sydney, did attempt to possess a substance being a border control substance, namely heroin, which had been unlawfully imported, and the quantity being imported was a commercial quantity, for that offence each of you will be sentenced to an overall sentence of six years and six months, to date from 25 February 2008 and to expire on 24 August 2014. Your non-parole period will be four years and two months, and that will expire on 24 April 2012. 115. I should indicate to all of you that what I have just done is sentence you to prison. In the case of Ms Basri, until 24 May 2011 when you will be released on parole. From what I am told, it is likely you will be deported at that time to Malaysia, but that is no part of my function. You will have a balance of term to serve of two years, that is likely that you will serve it at liberty in Malaysia, but you will be released from custody. 116. In respect of Mr Madubuko and Mr Okonkwo, you will not be released from custody until 24 April 2012 on the sentence I have set. I cannot work out how much more that is for any of you, you will have to do it yourselves, counsel will no doubt assist you. And again, the balance of your sentence will be served in the community. I have no doubt that the Department of Immigration will have an interest in deporting both of you, that does not mean that they will and I have nothing to do with any of that, in any event, but I guess that if one was a gambling man, it would be anticipated that the balance of your sentence may be served at liberty somewhere other than Australia.HIS HONOUR: I do want to thank, if I haven’t already done so, all counsel, including those not present, for their assistance during the trial. I want to thank all accused for their cooperation with the authorities and with the court during the trial. 117. The accused may be returned to custody.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The State of New South Wales (the State), by summons filed on 6 October 2009, applies for a continuing detention order in respect of the defendant pursuant to s 14A of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (the Act). Before me today is the preliminary hearing of the matter pursuant to s 15 of the Act.2 Mr Thomas is a sex offender within the meaning of s 4 as he has in the past been sentenced to imprisonment following conviction for a “serious sex offence” as defined in s 5(1)(a), being aggravated sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900. 3 The application is brought under s 14A which permits the State to apply for a continuing detention order against a person who is found guilty of an offence under s 12, being an offence of failing to comply with an interim or extended supervision order. The offender was made the subject of an extended supervision order in proceedings determined by Adams J last year: State of New South Wales v Thomas [2008] NSWSC 1340. The order was made on 8 October 2008 and was for a period of 12 months. On 17 July 2009 at the Waverley Local Court the defendant was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months, with a non-parole period of 9 months, in respect of 3 offences of failing to comply with that order. The sentences were each specified to have commenced on 22 January 2009. The defendant is due for release on parole on the expiration of the non-parole periods on 21 October 2009, that is, tomorrow.Issues for determination4 The first question for me to determine is whether I am satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order or extended supervision order: s 15(4). If I am so satisfied I must make orders appointing two qualified psychiatrists to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant and to furnish reports to the Court and direct the defendant to attend those examinations. If I am not so satisfied I must dismiss the application: s 15(5).5 On behalf of the defendant it has been conceded that I would be so satisfied. Indeed, it is the defendant’s position that when the matter is finally dealt with the result should be the making of an extended supervision order. 6 The State also applies for an order that the defendant be subject to an interim detention order pursuant to s 16(1) for a period of 28 days from 21 October 2009. Such an order may be made if the defendant’s current custody will expire before the proceedings are determined (s 16(1)(a)) and the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order or extended supervision order (s 16(1)(b)). The defendant resists the making of such an order but concedes there should be an interim supervision order.7 The task of the Court at the preliminary hearing stage is not to weigh up the documentation, or predict the ultimate result, or to consider what evidence the defendant might call at the final hearing: Attorney General (New South Wales) v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119. The test is one that is similar to the prima facie case test applied by magistrates in committal proceedings: Attorney General (NSW) v Hayter [2007] NSWSC 983 at [6]: State of New South Wales v Manners [2008] NSWSC 1242 at [8]. Whether or not the defendant opposes the orders sought at the preliminary hearing, it remains a matter for the Court to determine whether the statutory criteria have been satisfied: Attorney General (NSW) v Hayter at [4]; New South Wales v Manners at [4].8 The power to make an interim detention order is enlivened upon the Court being satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation relied upon by the State would justify the making of either type of final order. That is, an interim detention order is capable of being made even if the matters alleged would only justify the making of an extended supervision order, provided the substantive proceedings contain a claim for a continuing detention order. Even if the Court is satisfied of both matters in s 16(1) it remains a matter for the Court’s discretion as to whether to make a continuing detention order. See Attorney General for New South Wales v Tillman (supra) at [24] – [42].9 The question of whether the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order or extended supervision order (s 15(4)) requires consideration of the provisions of s 17. That section provides for the determination of applications for a continuing detention order. The Court may determine such an application by making an extended supervision order, or by making a continuing detention order, or by dismissing the application: s 17(1). An extended supervision order may be made if and only if the Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision: s 17(2). A continuing detention order may be made if an only if the Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision and that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order: s 17(3).  
     
      
    10 The “high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence” requirement is not without difficulty. Authority which I must follow has held that “likely in s 17(2) and (3) denotes a degree of probability at the upper end of the scale, but not necessarily exceeding 50%”: Tillman v Attorney General (NSW) [2007] NSWCA 327; 70 NSWLR 448 at [89], followed in Cornwall v Attorney General (NSW) [2007] NSWCA 374. Whether that is to remain an authoritative construction of the word in this context remains to be seen: The State of NSW v Fisk [2009] NSWSC 778 per Howie J at [24]. The alternative construction discussed in the authorities is that of McClellan CJ at CL in Attorney General (NSW) v Winters [2007] NSWSC 1071; 176 A Crim R 249 at [50] where his Honour held that “likely” in this context meant “more likely than not”11 In determining whether or not to make a continuing detention order or an extended supervision order the Court must have regard to the matters listed in s 17(4) in addition to any other matter it considers relevant. Given the application in the present case is brought under s 14A it is also necessary that the Court have regard to the nature of the failure to comply with the requirements of the earlier extended supervision order and the likelihood of further failures to comply: s 17(4A).12 In considering these issues the primary object of the Act should be borne in mind. It is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community: s 3(1). Another object of the Act is to encourage serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation: s 3(2).  
     
      
      The defendant’s offending history 
      
    13 The defendant has a long history of committing criminal offences, particularly sexual assault offences. The sexual assault offending commenced with the assault of a 17 year old female on 21 December 1968 when the defendant was 21 years of age. 6 weeks after a good behaviour bond was imposed for that offence he committed an offence of buggery against a 23 year old female. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. He was released from custody in 1975 but in January 1978 committed an offence of rape against a 16 or 17 year old female for which he received a sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. He was released on parole in July 1981 but in November of that year committed an offence of sexual intercourse without consent. For that offence he was sentenced to 4 years 10 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 2 months. He was released on parole in August 1984. In November 1985 he committed an offence of indecent assault and was sentenced to imprisonment for 9 months. After his release in respect of that sentence he received other sentences, most notably a sentence of 15 years with a non-parole period of 11 years which was later quashed by the Court of Criminal Appeal when his appeal against conviction was allowed. Nevertheless, whilst he was on parole in respect of that sentence he committed an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent for which he was sentenced to 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. The sentence commenced on 12 July 1996. He was not granted parole and served the full-term of that sentence.14 The details of the earlier offences are sparse. The first offence involved the defendant kissing a 17 year old acquaintance and then, he said, “I got carried away and went too far”. He conceded that the complainant’s allegations of violence “could be right”. What he actually did is unknown. The next offence involved him dragging the 23 year old victim into his house, hitting her and then having forceful anal intercourse. The third offence arose from circumstances in which he and another man were travelling in a car and picked up the 16 or 17 year old victim, her 17 year old male friend and her 13 year old sister. They were driven into bushland against their wishes where the defendant dragged the victim into the bush, threatened her with a gun he claimed to have, and digitally penetrated her before having forced vaginal intercourse. The next offence occurred when the defendant was working as a bouncer at a disco. He met the 23 year old victim and bought her some drinks before she went home. He followed her home but on the way grabbed her and had forcible vaginal intercourse. A little over a year after being released on parole he met a woman at a social security office, left and travelled on the same bus with her and managed to persuade her to allow him to enter her home on being requested to provide him with a cup of tea. He grabbed her and fondled her breasts, threatening to “break every bone in (her) body” if she told the police. Fortunately he took heed of her distressed demands for him to leave the house. A month after a subsequent release on parole he committed perhaps the most serious of this catalogue of offences. He turned up unannounced at the home of the girlfriend of a former cellmate and persuaded her to invite him in for a cup of tea. He quickly produced a large carving knife and proceeded to commit a succession of sexual assaults over a period of about three hours, sometimes in the presence of the victim’s three year old son. 15 The defendant has now spent close to 35 of the last 40 years in custody and there is material suggesting he is institutionalised. 16 The material before me is largely the same as was before Adams J last year. I do not propose to set it out in any detail. I am grateful for the summary that appears in his Honour’s judgment. At the risk of doing a disservice to his Honour’s analysis, the situation may be briefly summarised. The defendant has an antisocial personality disorder and has exhibited behaviours as a manifestation of that disorder since his early teenage years. He has committed sexual offences, some of the utmost gravity with violence or threats of violence, on six occasions between 1969 and 1996. Offences have been committed whilst in the community on conditional liberty by way of good behaviour bond and parole. The most serious offence was the last which was committed only a month after parole release. 17 The defendant has been assessed as being at high risk of re-offending. His credibility was found wanting by Adams J who said at least twice in his judgment that he did not believe him. In considering whether to release him under supervision or to make a continuing detention order, his Honour remarked that the fear of a return to prison if he did not fully comply with the conditions of a supervision order was powerful consideration in favour of making a supervision order, notwithstanding the defendant’s commission of serious offences in the past in breach of parole undertakings. He noted that the level of supervision and control to which the defendant could now be subjected was far greater than was possible in the past. He noted that the commission of any criminal offence, not just a serious sex offence, would result in the defendant being returned to prison. So too would the failure to comply with other stringent requirements of a supervision order. As a result, his Honour said that he was satisfied that, “supervision in accordance with the order and whilst he is resident in COSP accommodation is adequate to ensure that it is not likely that he will commit a further sex offence whilst under supervision”: State of NSW v Thomas (supra at [71]). The reference to “COSP” was to the Community Offender Support Program centre at Malabar. 
     
      
      Events after release on extended supervision order 
      
    18 There were 29 conditions of the extended supervision order (ESO). They included that he accept the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service (which included the Community Compliance Group of the Department of Corrective Services), that he comply with any reasonable direction given by supervising officers, that he give advance notice of his proposed movements and obtain prior approval for any proposed change, and that he not possess or consume any illicit drugs.19 He was released from custody on 8 October 2008 and proceeded to the COSP centre. He disclosed in an induction interview that he had used cannabis the night before. He told the interviewing staff member that he needed to obtain some strong pain relief “so will not smoke pot”. He signed a document headed “Core Rules” which set out the rules that residents of COSP must comply with. They included that there was to be no smoking on the premises except in designated areas and not to bring on to the premises or have in possession any illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia. 20 On 10 October 2008 the defendant acknowledged a number of requirements by signing a “formal written direction”. It included that he was “not to be in possession and or use …(a) prohibited drug or substance”. He acknowledged that breach of any of the directions in this document would be considered a breach of the ESO and could result in being returned to prison.21 A drug analysis test on 10 October 2008 was clear.22 In an Offender Intake Data Form completed on 29 October 2008 the defendant’s history included that he had smoked cannabis since the age of 9 and had been using that drug whilst in the prison at the rate of 16 grams per week. This document includes that in relation to his latest sexual offence he said that he had pleaded guilty but he was in fact not guilty. He alleged that he was “framed (set up by victim)”.23 On 22 November 2008 the defendant was abusive, argumentative and threatening towards an accommodation support worker over an issue of when he would complete some chores that had been assigned to him.24 The following day the same accommodation support worker recorded that the defendant had been argumentative about a request that he be permitted to leave the premises in order to visit a sick family friend at Woy Woy. He was told he would not be permitted to leave without prior approval of his schedule. He became abusive and threatened to kick the gate in if it was not opened for him. The author also noted that the defendant had been playing games and pushing boundaries. He had constantly been spoken to about sexualised comments to female staff, smoking within the buildings and failure to do chores properly.25 The Senior Compliance and Monitoring Officer of the Campbelltown Community Compliance Group (CCG) reported the defendant on 29 November 2008 for being in breach of his ESO. He had been found to be in possession of cannabis and implements used for ingesting the same. He admitted that he had been using cannabis away from the centre. The report also mentioned the defiant behaviour I have referred to above. It was recommended that the ESO be revoked. THC was detected in a drug test performed on 29 November 2008. On the evening of 29 November 2008 the offender was arrested and charged with failure comply with his ESO. He remained in custody until released on bail on 2 December 2008.26 Before returning to the COSP centre on the evening of 2 December 2008 the defendant was seen at the Westfield Eastgardens shopping centre asking members of the public for directions to Anzac Parade. He told a number of people that “he had just been released from jail for rape, and it was worth every minute of being in jail for the enjoyment he got out of what he had done”.27 Back at the COSP centre the defendant was searched. A small quantity of green matter was found which was subsequently surrendered by staff to the police. Four days later, on 6 December 2008 the defendant was again found to be in possession of a small quantity of green vegetable matter which was also surrendered to the police. On 8 December 2008 the defendant was arrested and charged in respect of his possession of 0.3 grams of cannabis leaf and also with failure to comply with the ESO. He was released on bail after appearing at Waverley Local Court on 9 December 2008.28 On 13 January 2009 the defendant was found to be in possession of items of clothing that were suspected of having been stolen. He was charged with an offence of goods in custody. The items of clothing comprised four T-shirts and five pairs of socks. He was also charged with failure to comply with the ESO.29 On 21 January 2009 the defendant wrote a “Statement of Request” which was said to be for “the right to live in peace for what life I have left”. Reference was made to him “trying to (do) my best to follow your unlawful laws”. It concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        I would like to bring to your notice that you are wasting my short life and your sanity by trying to force me into anything unlawful. If these reasonable requests cannot be met could you please return my case to court ASAP. (Spelling errors corrected). 
        
       
      
    30 On 19 January 2009 the offender acknowledged by signing a “formal written direction” requirements that he not to go into any retail store without prior approval and that he fulfil the daily reporting condition of his bail undertaking by leaving the centre at 8.00am and return to the COSP centre no later than 9.30am. This had been preceded by a verbal direction to that effect on 15 January 2009. On 16 January 2009 he returned to the centre at 10.20am and he was in possession of items purchased at a retail store that had not been approved. On 19 January he returned at 10.09am. On 20 January he returned at 9.45am. On 21 January he was approved to attend an office of the Department of Housing at Maroubra between 1.00pm and 3.30pm. He returned at 4.20pm. He explained that he had been to Broadway to see Prisoners Aid in relation to obtaining a birth certificate. He did not have approval for this. His satellite tracking unit was not operational and appeared to have gone flat. It is said that this can be caused by incorrect or insufficient charging by the offender. On 22 January the offender reported to Maroubra police as required at 9.07am. Rather than returning to the centre he proceeded to go to the Sydney CBD where he was located at various locations. He returned to the centre at 3.25pm. These matters all constituted breaches of conditions of the ESO (conditions 1, 3 and 4) that he accept supervision and guidance for the term of the order, that he comply with any reasonable direction, and that he inform his supervising officer of movements in advance on a weekly basis and obtain prior approval for any proposed change. 31 On 21 January 2009 the defendant’s tracking device was located in the grass in front of his room in the rain. Apparently a tracking device left in the rain has a likelihood of malfunctioning. This was a breach of a condition of the ESO (condition 8) that he comply with all instructions in relation to the operation of the equipment and must not tamper with or remove such equipment. For this, and the other breaches referred to earlier, it was recommended on 23 January 2009 that the ESO be revoked immediately.32 On 22 January 2009 he was charged with failure to comply with his ESO on 16 January 2009. Bail was refused. He has been in custody since that date. After he was taken into custody he was found to be in possession of some items of jewellery. A charge of goods in custody was preferred. 33 On 12 May 2009 the offences of goods in custody and failure to comply with the ESO of 13 January 2009 came before Waverley Local Court. The latter offence was dismissed but for the former the defendant was sentenced to 1 month imprisonment from 22 January 2009.34 On 23 June 2009 the offence of goods in custody in relation to the jewellery was dealt with at Central Local Court and a 2 month term of imprisonment dating from 22 January 2009 was imposed.35 All of the other outstanding charges were determined at Waverley Local Court on 17 July 2009. He was convicted of the offences of failing to comply with the ESO on 29 November, 6 December 2008 and 16 January 2009 and sentenced in each case to imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of 9 months with all sentences specified to commence on 22 January 2009. For the offence of possessing a prohibited drug on 6 December 2008 there was a sentence of 3 months commencing on the same date. 
     
      
      Consideration of matters in s 17(4) 
      
    36 The “safety of the community” (s 17(4)(a)) is an overriding consideration. The defendant has demonstrated by his commission of serious offences that he has in the past presented a danger to the safety of the community. 37 The reports of psychiatrists and psychologists that are before me at this stage are, in the main, the same that were before Adams J last year. I have briefly touched upon some of the major issues that emerge from them but otherwise refer to the summary of that material in his Honour’s judgment. The most significant issue is the assessment of the defendant being at high risk of re-offending if released without being required to engage in a structured and supervised management program in the community. 38 The defendant has been assessed on the STATIC-99 actuarial tool for predicting the risk of re-offending at a “high level” category. This is a tool that is of quite limited utility for reasons discussed by Adams J at [28] – [32]. 39 A more recent report is a Risk Assessment Report by Mr Patrick Sheehan, senior specialist psychologist of the Department of Corrective Services Serious Sex Offenders Review Group. It is lengthy and I do not propose to review it in detail. It notes that “little appears to have changed regarding Mr Thomas since the previous application”. He concludes that if the defendant were to receive another extended supervision order it may be unlikely that he would be able to complete it successfully. If he were to receive a continuing detention order the best possible outcome would be that he participate in the CUBIT (Custody-based Intensive Treatment) programme.40 The defendant has not completed any sex offender rehabilitation programmes. He has resisted engaging with the CUBIT programme because he has claimed that he does not want to have to mix with paedophiles.41 The defendant has a serious heart condition and his life expectancy is substantially reduced. However, there was evidence before Adams J to the effect that this condition was not such as would render him incapable of committing a serious sex offence.42 Compliance with obligations to which the defendant has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order (s 17(4)(f)) and the likelihood of further failures to comply (s 17(4A)) are factors which weigh heavily against the defendant. The history of his offences shows repeated offending whilst in the community on conditional liberty, sometimes within a short period of time after release from custody. The history of his conduct whilst subject to the extended supervision order imposed by Adams J demonstrates a continuing attitude of defiance. There is nothing before me on this preliminary hearing that would indicate that he would behave any differently if once again released. His infractions of the rules of the COSP centre were, in the scheme of things, relatively minor. More significant, however, is his deliberate flouting of the requirements as to the places where he could go, and when. None of his previous sexual offences involved premeditation or planning to any significant extent. They largely involved victims he met by chance with offences committed in circumstances that were opportunistic. With the defendant having a defiant attitude as to his movements despite directions and monitoring there remains a risk that he could find himself in similar opportunistic situations in the future if released into the community.43 Professor Greenberg did not diagnose the offender with a sexual disorder but found that his primary motive for sexual offending was sexual gratification. He reported that the defendant “believes that he has the right to have sex with women”. He found the defendant to be in the “high risk” group category with regard to the potential for further acts of sexual offending. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Thomas’ prognosis is generally guarded at this time without significant changes to his pattern of maladaptive behaviours. … the risk for re-offending could in my opinion be partially reduced with successful treatment. Despite the benefits of treatment, I am of the view that Mr Thomas would however remain a relatively high risk for re-offending in the short term. 
        
       
      
    44 That was Professor Greenberg’s view prior to the release of the defendant last year. There is no evidence before me of any change in his “pattern of maladaptive behaviours”, nor that there has been any “successful treatment” that would partially reduce the risk for re-offending.  
     
      
      Conclusion 
      
    45 Having regard to these considerations I am satisfied, on the basis of the material relied upon by the plaintiff alone, and without by any means expressing any concluded view as to what the final outcome of the proceedings might be, that the matters alleged would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order or extended supervision order. I have made this assessment independent of the concession made on behalf of the defendant. In coming to this conclusion at the preliminary hearing level I am satisfied that the material is capable of establishing to high degree of probability that the defendant is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision. I am satisfied of this on the construction of “likely” in the Tillman sense as well as in the Winters sense. Whilst it is unnecessary for me to form any final conclusion at this point as to whether “adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order” (s 17(3)) for the reasons given earlier, I conclude on the material presently available that it would not. It is, in my view, appropriate to make an interim detention order.  
     
      
      Orders 
      
    46 I make orders for the continued detention of the defendant, for the appointment of two psychiatrists to conduct separate psychiatric examinations, and for the further listing of the matter in accordance with the short minutes of order.

    JUDGMENT1. A witness has given evidence about being assaulted by a man called Chris. Mr Watts for the accused objects to that evidence under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. He argues that I must refuse to admit it because its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to his client. 2. The evidence has been adduced in response to a question in re-examination by the Crown Prosecutor, Ms Herbert. It is common ground that this witness did not know the name of the man who was assaulting him. He had heard reference by another person assaulting him to the name Chris followed by the experience of being assaulted by the man probably to whom that was addressed. 3. Section 76 of the Evidence Act provides that evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed. In my view the assertion by the witness that he was assaulted by “that man called Chris” can only be an inference or opinion formed by him. It therefore cannot prove that the person assaulting him was named Chris. Its probative value is therefore in my opinion slight in the context of the issues in this case. 4. Mr Watts argues that the danger of unfair prejudice to his client is that it elevates the evidence of this witness to identification evidence when it is common ground that this witness cannot give identification evidence. In other words he argues the evidence could be misused by the jury therefore leading to unfairness to his client in a prejudicial way. 5. I agree with his submission and I propose to reject the evidence and to direct the jury accordingly.

    JUDGMENT1. Mr Watts for the accused has applied to discharge the jury. 2. One of the issues in this case is the identification of the accused. Part of the Crown Prosecutor’s opening was this sentence - 
     
      
      “ 
      [complainant] says that he was carried to the car by all three of them; by Mrs Singh, by the person who is David Hoey and by the accused 
      .” 
       
      
    An available interpretation of that sentence is that the complainant identifies the accused as one of the persons who carried him out to the car. In fact, that is not the Crown’s case. It is now apparent from the evidence of the complainant, who is still in evidence in chief, that he is not able to identify the accused as one of the persons who carried him out to the car. Nor does Ms Herbert, who appears as Crown Prosecutor, anticipate that he will give such evidence.3. Mr Watts argues that the Crown Prosecutor made a distinction in the manner of her opening at that point where she specifically referred to something which she expected the complainant would say as evidence. That is in contrast to the balance of her opening which was in a narrative form. I make no criticism myself of the narrative form. In fact it is a very good and clear form of opening as the Crown’s opening was in this case.4. However, I can see the force in Mr Watts’ point. In my opinion the matter does not warrant the discharge of the jury. Discharge of a jury, even early in a trial, is an extreme measure and, in my opinion, ought not to be taken unless, if it is not necessary, it is really the appropriate course. In my opinion a more appropriate course is the alternative suggested by Mr Watts - if he was unsuccessful in his primary application - namely that there needs to be some sort of correction.5. Ms Herbert has proposed that she is prepared to make reference - by way of correction - to her opening at this stage, the commencement of the second day of the trial before the complainant resumes his evidence in chief. I propose to confirm that an opening is not evidence itself. I regard that as an appropriate course to deal with any possible prejudice occasioned to the accused by the issue raised by Mr Watts.6. I might add that I doubt whether that prejudice is likely to crystallise if there were no correction made. I think it will be apparent, by the sounds of what I am told by counsel, that there is no issue about this witness being able to identify the accused. I expect by the time the jury is considering its verdict that that will be very clear in their minds that any passing interpretation of a sentence in the opening is likely to have been lost. Nevertheless, I regard the proposed alternative by Mr Watts which is to be adopted by the Crown as appropriate.

   JUDGMENT1. The current witness, Maria Mavrothalassitis, is giving evidence of what she saw as part of the events giving rise to an assault that the accused has been charged with. She described a man assaulting the victim as “wearing a yellow shirt and jeans.”. That description is contained in a statement made by her to the police on 22 April 2009. When asked in the witness box for her recollection of what the man was wearing she could not recall that aspect of her description. Ms Herbert, who appears as Crown Prosecutor, sought leave under s 32 of the Evidence Act 1995 to permit the witness to refresh her memory from the statement. 2. It was established on the voir dire that the statement was made when the events were fresh in her memory. The statement was made only a few days after the events. It was further established that the witness found the statement to be accurate. Leave was not opposed on that issue by Mr Watts, who appears for the accused. 3. However, after she refreshed her memory from the statement her response to whether or not she could now recollect was that she still could not recollect what the person was wearing at the time. She said that no doubt she was able to recollect at the time of making her statement but could not now say from her personal recollection what the person was wearing.4. Mr Watts opposes any further attempt at reviving the witness’ memory or any attempt under s 32(3) of the Evidence Act to permit her to read aloud the relevant part of her statement. He said it would be unfair to his client and also add unduly to the length of the hearing. He makes those submissions by reference to s 192 of the Evidence Act. 5. There has been some additional hearing time as a result of some questions on the voir dire. Mr Watts pointed out that the unfairness is based upon the assertion that it is common ground that the description otherwise given by this witness of the person assaulting the victim was consistent with a co-offender, not this accused. The unfairness Mr Watts says is that it enables the Crown Prosecutor to reduce the impact of this witness’ evidence in comparison to another witness who will be called. 6. Ms Herbert frankly acknowledges that her submission will be that the evidence of this witness will be less reliable than the evidence of other witnesses. The description of the clothing will be one basis for that submission. The witness’ observation in her statement - which was marked VD B - was clearly relevant. It seems to be me to be an appropriate basis for the Crown Prosecutor to tender it. 7. I do not regard the reason for the tender as imposing any unfairness upon the accused. The evidence - which as I said is relevant - merely provides a basis for a submission about the reliability of the witness. That submission may well be against the accused’s interests, but not in a way which in my opinion is unfair. 8. Accordingly, I propose to grant leave to the witness under s 32(3) of the Evidence Act.

    JUDGMENT1. The Crown Prosecutor, Ms Herbert, has objected to the line of cross-examination by Mr Watts. Mr Watts is cross-examining one of the principal witnesses in the Crown case. He is the person who is alleged to be the victim of a serious assault. The accused is said to be one of the persons responsible for that assault.2. Mr Watts is asking this witness questions touching upon the behaviour of another person who was part of the assault. The questions concern that other person behaving in a way that involved her lying about this witness, and having a motive to harm this witness. That other person is going to be called by the Crown as a witness, but has not yet given evidence. One question which arises is whether this line of cross-examination amounts to credibility evidence as that is defined in s 101A of the Evidence Act 1995. 3. It does appear in my opinion that evidence about another witness lying and having a motive to harm this witness is relevant to the other person’s credibility. However, Mr Watts argues that it is not credibility evidence because it is not relevant only because it affects the assessment of the credibility of that other person. He also argues that it does not fall within the other classification in s 101A because although it may affect the assessment of the credibility of the other person, it is not otherwise inadmissible. He goes on to argue that it is admissible as tendency evidence. 4. It does appear to me to amount to evidence of the conduct of the other person pointing to a tendency on her part to act in a particular way, namely, to do harm to this particular witness. I accept Mr Watts’ submission that it is tendency evidence. 5. Ms Herbert points out that it still cannot be led because Mr Watts has not given the appropriate notice under s 97(1)(a) of the Evidence Act. Mr Watts relies upon the non applicability of that notice requirement by making an application to me under s 100 of the Evidence Act to dispense with the notice requirement in this case. He points out that the area that he is cross-examining on in fact is disclosed in material served upon him by the Crown. 6. One of the important areas in giving leave under s 100 is the extent of any prejudice to the other party. Ms Herbert does not put forward an argument to the effect that the Crown is prejudiced or taken by surprise, so that I am inclined to direct the tendency rule not to apply. I do need also to regard the evidence as having significant probative value. In my opinion, the area that Mr Watts is cross-examining about has significant probative value so far as the evidence of the other person proposed to be called by the Crown is concerned, and I give a direction under s 100 of the Evidence Act that the tendency rule is not to apply, despite the accused’s failure to give notice under s 97.

     NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION v Quoc Hui VU & Sinh Thi TRAN 
     
     
      
       
      FACTS 
       
       
      On 12 November 2008 the respondents were charged with cultivation of prohibited plants under s 23  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
       1985. The NSW Crime Commission made an application under s 10  
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act 
       1990 for a restraining order against, particularly, the house in which it was alleged some 84 cannabis plants were cultivated.  
       
       
      An order under s 10 must be made where an application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating, relevantly, that the officer has a suspicion that the person has engaged in a serious crime related activity and the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for that suspicion. In this case, the application was supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that he had the relevant suspicion based on police Facts Sheets, a conversation with the investigating officer who wrote the Facts Sheets, and a search of the NSW COPS system. 
       
       
      Justice Adams declined to make the order. The Commission seeks leave to appeal. The issue before this Court was whether his Honour erred in failing to come to the conclusion that there were reasonable grounds for suspicion. 
       
       
      HELD 
       
      (Spigelman CJ, Allsop P and Hodgson JA agreeing)  
       
       
      The nature of the appeal 
       
       
      1 The determination to be made by this Court is equivalent to the exercise of a judgment based on inference. The word ‘consider’ in s 10 (3) is akin to the word ‘satisfied’, which has been held to require an appellate court to adopt the approach in  
      House v The King 
      . However, the ex parte nature of the application indicates that an appeal is the only occasion on which a person can be heard regarding the interference with their property rights. As such, the determination made by the first instance judge should be treated in the same way as an inference from facts. Furthermore, in the context of the statutory scheme, which involves only a one-step determination with no discretion as to the final issuance of the order (the order “must” be made), the decision is best characterised as a judgment rather than as the exercise of a discretion. Therefore, the principles in  
      Warren v Coombes 
       apply. [5] [8]-[9] [12] [14]-[18] [55] [59]

      Reasonable grounds for suspicion 
      
     
     
      
      2 The affidavit disclosed reasonable grounds. It was based on information from an identified police officer who was involved in the investigation, who had access to all the relevant information, and who accepted responsibility for the basic facts upon which the suspicion was based.

      2 It is not necessary, when adducing evidence in the course of a hearsay statement, to identify the ultimate source of the information contained in that statement. As such, it is not necessary that the deponent of the affidavit identify the persons who supplied information in the police Facts Sheet, as long as the author of the Facts Sheet is adequately identified. However, the extent of any failure to identify ultimate sources will affect the determination of whether reasonable grounds for the suspicion have been made out by the deponent.

      3 The mere fact that a police officer charges a person with an offence is not a basis for a reasonable suspicion of serious criminal activity, it is merely evidence that some other person had such a suspicion or belief. [39] [55] [58] [59]

    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The respondents have been charged with offences, relevantly pursuant to s 23 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, being offences with respect to cultivation of prohibited plants. These offences constitute serious crime related activity by force of the provisions of s 6(1), (2)(b) and (3)(a) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (“the Act”). 
     
      
    2 Pursuant to s 10 of the Act the appellant Commission made an application to the Court for a restraining order pending the determination of a confiscation order pursuant to the Act. The restraining order sought is in large measure directed to the house which, according to the material presented to the Court, was used extensively for the purposes of cultivation of cannabis plants, some 84 of which were found at different parts of the house. 
     
      
    3 Section 10 of the Act relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “10(1) A restraining order is an order that no person is to dispose of or attempt to dispose of, or to otherwise deal with or attempt to otherwise deal with, an interest in property to which the order applies except in such manner or in such circumstances (if any) as are specified in the order. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court, ex parte, for a restraining order in respect of:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) specified interests, a specified class of interests or all the interests, in property of a person suspected of having engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities, including interests acquired after the making of the order and before the making of an assets forfeiture order affecting the interests that are subject to the restraining order, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The Supreme Court must make the order applied for under subsection (2) if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) in the case of an application in respect of an interest referred to in subsection (2) (a)—the authorised officer suspects that the person has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        and the Court considers that having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.” 
        
       
      
    4 The application was heard by Adams J who rejected it. The Commission seeks leave to appeal on the basis that his Honour erred in failing to come to the conclusion that there were reasonable grounds for suspicion. The respondents did not appear on the appeal. Mr I Temby QC appeared, with Mr P Singleton, for the appellant. The application for leave and the appeal were heard together. 
     
      
       
      The Test of Error 
       
      
    5 The first matter that falls to be determined is whether the judgment which the Court must make, pursuant to the concluding clause of s 10(3), is equivalent to the exercise of a discretion, to which the approach of House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 applies, or the formulation of a judgment based on inference of the character to which the principles in Warren v Coombes (1979) 142 CLR 531 apply. (See Perpetual Trustee Company Ltd v Khoshaba [2006] NSWCA 41 at [34]-[40].) In my opinion, the latter is the case. 
     
      
    6 Although in practice there may be little difference between the two, it is important to proceed on the correct principles. (See Khoshaba supra at [40]; Certain Lloyds Underwriters v Giannopoulos [2009] NSWCA 56 at [111].)  
     
      
    7 The word ‘discretion’ is used in a range of different senses. (See Dwyer v Calco Timbers Pty Ltd [2008] HCA 13; (2008) 234 CLR 124 at [37]-[40] and the earlier authorities set out by McColl JA in Director of Public Prosecutions v El Mawas [2006] NSWCA 154; (2006) 66 NSWLR 93 at [64]-[70].) The stricter approach of House v The King is not necessarily applicable because a decision can reasonably be so described. There is a distinction between ‘judgment’ and ‘discretion’ although the differentiation occurs over a spectrum. (See Francis Bennion “Distinguishing Judgment and Discretion” (2000) Public Law 368; Francis Bennion “Judgment and Discretion Revisited: Pedantry or Substance?” (2005) Public Law 20.) 
     
      
    8 The focal word in s 10(3), in this respect, is ‘consider’. It is what the Court “considers” to be “reasonable grounds for … suspicion” that constitutes the statutory precondition for the mandatory order.  
     
      
    9 The word ‘consider’ is the equivalent of the word ‘satisfied’ that has, in a number of statutory contexts, been held to require an appellate court to apply the approach in House v The King. (See eg Norbis v Norbis (1985) 161 CLR 513 esp at 517-520, 530-541; Singer v Berghouse (1994) 181 CLR 201 at 208, 226; Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2000] HCA 47; (2000) 203 CLR 194 at [2], [18]-[21].) However, a protean word such as ‘satisfied’ must take its meaning from its context. 
     
      
    10 Each statutory regime must be considered by the application of the basic principle of statutory interpretation that regard must always be had to context. (See, eg, Khoshaba supra at [32]; Certain Lloyds Underwriters supra at [104].) 
     
      
    11 As Ipp JA said in Costa v Public Trustee of NSW [2008] NSWCA 223; (2008) 1 ASTLR 56 at [32]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[32] Judicial error requiring the intervention of an appellate court is a protean concept. Examples of the form that it can take are manifold. The tests for determining judicial error depend on the nature of the decision under appellate challenge. The judicial constraint required before appellate intervention can occur differs depending on the nature of the decision under appeal.” 
        
       
      
    12 In contrast with other legislative regimes considered in the cases referred to at [9] above, as subsequently applied, a distinguishing feature of the statute under consideration is that there is no two stage process where the formulation of the jurisdictional judgment is stage one and there is a second stage invoking terminology of discretion with respect to the making of an order. (See, eg, Khoshaba supra at [36]-[39].) Here the statute states that the order “must” be made.  
     
      
    13 Such a legislative structure does not involve a substantial overlap between the jurisdictional ‘satisfaction’ and the discretionary power to make an order, which renders a distinction between the two stages ‘artificial’. (See Goodman v Windeyer (1980) 144 CLR 490 at 502.) 
     
      
    14 An application under s 10 is expressly ex parte and is directed to preserving assets for an ultimate confiscation order under Pt 3 of the Act. An order under Pt 3 does not turn on any judgment on the part of the first instance judge, of the kind indicated by the word ‘considers’ in s 10(3). An order leading to confiscation of property requires that the judge ‘finds it more probable than not’ that the person engaged in serious crime related activity. (See s 22(2) regarding an assets forfeiture order and s 27(2) regarding a proceeds assessment order.) Furthermore, applications under Pt 3 are not expressed to be made ex parte. 
     
      
    15 The ex parte nature of the application is, in my opinion, the decisive consideration. Although provision is made in the Act for excluding assets and for allowing access to frozen assets for specific purposes, an appeal is the only occasion on which a person subjected to so significant an interference with property rights can be heard on the validity and appropriateness of the process. (See New South Wales Crime Commission v Ollis [2006] NSWCA 76; (2006) 65 NSWLR 478 at [9]-[10], [34].) 
     
      
    16 In such a context the judgment made by the first instance judge – “considers … there are reasonable grounds for … suspicion” – should be treated in the same way as an inference from primary facts. The word “Court” in s 10(3) of the Act, includes this Court on appeal.  
     
      
    17 As the High Court said in Warren v Coombes supra at 552: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … The duty of the appellate court is to decide the case - the facts as well as the law - for itself. In so doing it must recognize the advantages enjoyed by the judge who conducted the trial. But if the judges of appeal consider that in the circumstances the trial judge was in no better position to decide the particular question than they are themselves, or if, after giving full weight to his decision, they consider that it was wrong, they must discharge their duty and give effect to their own judgment. Further there is, in our opinion, no reason in logic or policy to regard the question whether the facts found do or do not give rise to the inference that a party was negligent as one which should be treated as peculiarly within the province of the trial judge. On the contrary we should have thought that the trial judge can enjoy no significant advantage in deciding such a question.” 
        
       
       
      This analysis applies to a decision under s 10(3) of the Act. 
       
       
      The Evidence before Adams J 
       
      
    18 Adams J admitted into evidence an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark who is the Assistant Director of Financial Investigations at the New South Wales Crime Commission. Mr Spark annexed two Facts Sheets, in the case of each of Mr Vu and Ms Tran. The Facts Sheets were, relevantly, in substantially similar terms. They outlined the police discovery of the cannabis plants in the house, to which I have referred above. 
     
      
    19 Mr Spark stated that he had formed a suspicion that Mr Vu had engaged in serious criminal related activities, relevantly, offences under s 23(1A) and s 23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. He went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “4 The suspicion … is held by me on the following grounds: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) On 16 December 2008 I contacted Leading Senior Constable James Taylor of the NSW Police Force (‘Taylor’) via Eaglenet and had a conversation in which Taylor agreed to send in by facsimile the Facts Sheet relating to the arrest of Vu (‘the Vu Facts Sheet’) and the Facts Sheet relating to the arrest of Sinh Thi Tran (‘Tran’) (‘the Tran Facts Sheet’). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) On 16 December 2008 Taylor sent to me by facsimile transmission copies the Vu Facts Sheet and a copy of the Tran Facts Sheet. A copy of the facsimile is annexed hereto and marked ‘A’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (3) I have had regard to the Vu Facts sheet and the Tran Facts sheet. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (4) On 22 December 2008 I telephoned Taylor via Eaglenet and he transferred me to Constable Daniel Lovell of the NSW Police Force (‘Lovell’), with whom I had a conversation in which: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) I said: ‘Are you aware that on 16 December 2008 Leading Senior Constable James Taylor forwarded a copy of the Facts Sheet in relation to the arrest of Quoc Hoi Vu and the Facts Sheet in relation to the arrest of Sinh Thi Tran?’; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) Lovell said: ‘Yes’; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) I said: ‘Were you involved in the police investigation described in those Facts Sheets?’; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) Lovell said: ‘Yes’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) I said: ‘Did you assist in drafting the Facts Sheets?’; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) Lovell said: ‘Yes’; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) I said: ‘To the best of your knowledge and belief are the contents of the Facts Sheets true?’; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (h) Lovell said: ‘Yes’; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) I said: ‘Were the Facts sheets prepared on the basis of information obtained by police as a result of the investigation described in the Facts Sheets?’; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (j) Lovell said: ‘Yes’, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          and I believe each of Lovell’s responses to my questions to be true. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (5) On 22 December 2008 I, operating a computer located at the Commission, conducted a search of the records of COPS and located a record that revealed that on 12 November 2008 Vu was charged with the offences described in the Vu Facts Sheets. A true copy of this record is annexed hereto and marked ‘B’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (6) I take the reference to ‘section 23(1a)’ and ‘section 23(2)(A)’ where they appear on page 1 of the Tran Facts Sheet (being page 8 of this affidavit) and page 1 of the Vu Facts Sheet (being page 12 of this affidavit) to be typographical errors that should read ‘section 23(1A)’ and ‘section 23(2)(a)’ respectively.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    20 Mr Spark indicated that he had also formed a similar suspicion with respect to Ms Tran for the same offences. In this regard he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “6 The suspicion … is held by me on the following grounds: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) I have had regard to paragraphs 4(1) to 4(4) inclusive and paragraph 4(6) above. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) On 22 December 2008 I, operating a computer located at the Commission, conducted a search of the records of COPS and located a record that revealed that on 12 November 2008 Tran was charged with the offences described in the second Facts Sheet. A true copy of this record is annexed hereto and marked ‘C’.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    21 The Fact Sheets identified in some detail what the police observed at the premises, specifically the discovery of the cannabis plants and the presence of equipment for their cultivation. It also referred to the fact that the respondents were arrested and charged. 
     
      
       
      The Decision of Adams J 
       
      
    22 In his judgment Adams J summarised the affidavit of Mr Sparks. His Honour referred to the then recent judgment of the Court of Appeal in International Finance Trust Company Limited v New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] NSWCA 291; (2008) 251 ALR 479 (“the IFTC case”). His Honour identified the issue before him as: “Whether the link between the Fact Sheets and Mr Sparks’ suspicion is sufficient to justify if”. His Honour identified the features of the affidavit considered in the IFTC case.  
     
      
    23 His Honour accepted the observations by Allsop P at par [23] that it was not necessary to prove the underlying facts constituting the elements of the serious crime or criminal activity and referred to the following passage from the judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “[24] … [The suspicion] may be held because of information received from a third party; it may be held because of what a colleague has said; it may be held because of observations that had been made by the deponent …” 
        
       
      
    24 His Honour then posed for himself a question as to whether “when the information is received from a third party or from a colleague, that third party or colleague must be identified”.  
     
      
    25 Adams J referred to the evidence in the affidavit of Mr Spark before him, particularly at par [4] set out at [19] above, being information conveyed to Mr Spark by Constable Lovell. Adams J posed the issue as to whether or not Constable Lovell had to, in turn, identify persons from whom he obtained the information.  
     
      
    26 His Honour referred to a submission that it was not necessary to do so and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[6] I regret, however, that I am unable to see the validity of this distinction. It seems to me to be artificial in the extreme. Ultimately, it seems to me to follow from what was said by the majority in the Court of Appeal that even though information may well be received from a third party and even though it may be held because of what a colleague has said, the third party must be identified or the colleague identified. 
        
       
       
        
        [7] Here it is said that the source of the information is Constable Lovell and that Constable Lovell is reporting what others unnamed and unidentified have told him and that there is no need to identify those persons. This is but to take the point made by the Court of Appeal one step back with no advance on the point in principle. Although, it is true, I am dealing with a reference in an affidavit to a facts sheet which has been ‘verified’ by an intervening police officer who was involved in the investigation. It does not seem to me that this mode of proving the information received satisfies the Act. 
        
       
       
        
        [8] Accordingly I must refuse to make the orders.” 
        
       
      
    27 As can be seen from the extract from Mr Spark’s affidavit set out at [19] above, Mr Lovell stated that he had been involved in the police investigation; that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, the contents of the Facts Sheets were true and that the Facts Sheets were prepared on the basis of information obtained by police as a result of all the information. Mr Spark went on to say that he believed each of Mr Lovell’s responses. However, the absence of any reference by Constable Lovell to the sources of the specific information to which he referred was seen by Justice Adams to be a critical defect. 
     
      
    28 These proceedings were heard on the same day, and before the same Bench, as the appeal in the case of Elfar v New South Wales Crime Commission [2009] NSWCA 348. The nature of the affidavit evidence in the present case is a considerable improvement on the affidavit and Facts Sheet considered in that case, and on that considered in the IFTC case. Specifically, Mr Spark’s affidavit in these proceedings is based on information from an identified police officer, who was involved in the investigation and who, either directly or as part of a team, had access to all of the relevant information. That officer has accepted responsibility for the statements as to the basic facts upon which the suspicion of criminal conduct held by Mr Spark was said to be based. 
     
      
       
      The Issue of Leave 
       
      
    29 In two subsequent judgments, other judges of the Court have reached a different conclusion to that expressed by Adams J. Harrison J in New South Wales Crime Commission v Sun [2009] NSWSC 6 and Fullerton J in New South Wales Crime Commission v Tucker [2009] NSWSC 1049 each granted the application for a restraining order. This Court has before it the judgments in those cases and also the affidavits upon which the Commission relied in each case.  
     
      
    30 Relevantly, the affidavits in both Sun and Tucker had the identical structure to that which existed in the present case, namely, the suspicion of the deponent was based, in each case, on a Facts Sheet to which the deponent of the affidavit had regard. Furthermore, in each case the deponent had a conversation with an officer involved in the relevant police investigation who stated that, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, the contents of the Facts Sheet were true and that the Facts Sheet was prepared on the basis of information obtained by police as a result of the investigation. In the present case the deponent went on to say that he believed the police officer’s statements in each respect.  
     
      
    31 Both Harrison J and Fullerton J did not proceed on the basis of the reasons given by Adams J, to the effect that the informing officer ought to have identified the persons who supplied the information in the Facts Sheet to him or her, insofar as the officer did not have direct knowledge of any such matter. 
     
      
    32 In Tucker supra Fullerton J noted that she did not have a copy of the affidavit tendered before Adams J in the case presently under appeal and that she would not comment on his Honour’s assessment of the evidence. Her Honour did, however, say: 
     
      
       
        
        “[18] … Suffice for me to note that the evidence in the present case (and, it would appear, the evidence tendered before Harrison J in  
        Sun 
        ) does not suffer from the defect identified by Adams J in  
        Vu & Tran 
        . Nestorovic was one of a number of named police officers who together comprised the task force that investigated the defendant’s criminal activities and the facts sheet was prepared by him on the basis of his shared involvement with those police as distinct from it being simply verified by him without his colleagues being named or identified. For my part, I wish only to add that I would consider it a rare case where a police officer who prepares a facts sheet or other report of an investigation is not in a position to identify, by name, the police officers and/or other third party sources from whom information is gathered such as would have addressed what Adams J regarded as a deficiency in the evidence relied upon by the plaintiff in the case before him.” 
        
       
      
    33 In Tucker Constable Nestorovic made the same statements as Constable Lovell made in the present case. The Facts Sheet was, however, much more detailed and included a list of officers who had been involved in the investigation.  
     
      
    34 In the present case there was no such list. However, three arresting officers were identified in each Facts Sheet, one of whom was Constable Lovell. It does appear from the Facts Sheets that they were the only three officers involved. There was, at first, no detailed investigation. Rather police attended at the premises with respect to an unrelated matter and it was during the course of that attendance that they discovered the cannabis plants. More detailed investigation followed in execution of a search warrant. It appears that in this case, as in Tucker, the Facts Sheet was prepared by one officer, as Fullerton J put it, “on the basis of his shared involvement” with the other police involved in the discovery of the offence. No doubt some of the information in the Facts Sheet was not based on his own observation. However, that was also the case in Tucker. 
     
      
    35 It does appear that there are conflicting judgments in this Court on the important question of the evidentiary requirements for an application under s 10 of the Act. The issue arises frequently. On the evidence before the Court, about three applications for restraining orders are made each week to the Court. Leave to appeal should be granted. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    36 In pars [6] and [7] of his reasons, set out in par [26] above, Adams J purported to apply the views of the majority in the IFTC case. He interpreted that case as requiring that the source of information must be identified and that it was insufficient for a police officer, even one who was involved in the investigation, to verify it if some of the information was provided to him by other officers. In my opinion, his Honour’s reasoning in this respect was wrong. 
     
      
    37 The issue in the IFTC case, determined by majority, was concerned with the admissibility of hearsay statements in proceeding under s 10. The judgment of Allsop P, with whom Beazley JA agreed: 
     
      
       
        affirmed earlier authority that an application under s 10 is interlocutory in character (at [4]); 
       
       
        identified the need to apply the rules of evidence to such an application, by reason of the provisions of s 5(2)(b) of the Act (at [9]-[11]); 
       
       
        referred to common law principles for admission of evidence in an interlocutory proceeding (at [13]-[14]); 
       
       
        identified the particular relevance of s 75 of the  
       Evidence Act  
       1995 (at [15]) which provides: 
       
       
        
        “In an interlocutory proceeding, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence if the party who adduces it also adduces evidence of its source.” 
        
       
       
        identified the requirement of s 10(3) for the supporting affidavit to state the grounds on which a suspicion is based (at [21]-[24]). 
       
      
    38 The crucial matter in the decision of the majority in IFTC was the failure of the deponent of the affidavit in that case to give any evidence as to the source of knowledge or the basis of his suspicion (see [27]-[32]). Accordingly, the majority concluded that the relevant paragraphs of the affidavit were not admissible under s 75 of the Evidence Act or otherwise and did not, contrary to the requirements s 10(3), state grounds of suspicion (at [33]). 
     
      
    39 I note that Allsop P went on to say (at [38]) that the mere fact that a charge had been laid did not provide reasonable grounds for suspicion. His Honour also noted that such a submission was not put by the New South Wales Crime Commission in that case. Accordingly, it is necessary for this Court to decide the issue rather than to simply apply Allsop P’s conclusion. Such a submission was put in this case by Mr Temby on behalf of the Commission. It should be rejected. The mere fact that the police charge somebody is not a basis for a suspicion of serious criminal activity. It is merely evidence that some other person had such a suspicion or belief. It is not capable, of itself, of establishing that there is a proper basis for any suspicion. 
     
      
    40 Allsop P’s ultimate conclusion was that the primary judge erred by making orders in circumstances where there was no admissible evidence before him which could be the basis of a finding that there were reasonable grounds for the suspicion. 
     
      
    41 The IFTC case, on the majority reasoning, turned and turned only on a question of admissibility. The dissenter in that case, McClellan CJ at CL, went on to conclude that, notwithstanding the absence of any identification of the source of information to the deponent, the affidavit did disclose reasonable grounds for the suspicion which the deponent expressed to hold (see at [133]-[135]). Allsop P expressly stated that, if he had not been of the opinion that the evidence was inadmissible, he would have agreed with McClellan CJ at CL’s analysis in this respect (see at [51]). 
     
      
    42 It is clear, in my opinion, that Adams J proceeded on a mistaken understanding of the reasoning of this Court in the IFTC case. Indeed, even if the House v The King test applied, it appears that his Honour implicitly proceeded on the basis of a misinterpretation of s 75 of the Evidence Act. Nothing in that section, nor the IFTC case itself, suggests that it is necessary, when adducing evidence in the course of a hearsay statement, to identify the ultimate source of the information contained in that statement. 
     
      
    43 Section 75 of the Evidence Act, which is expressly directed to interlocutory proceedings, is based on a recognition that interlocutory applications frequently need to be made on an urgent basis, when direct evidence may not be able to be gathered in sufficient time or where it is undesirable to alert the other party. The scheme of Pt 2 of the Act presently under consideration is quintessentially of that character.  
     
      
    44 As Thomas J said in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Ahern (No 2) (1988) 2 Qd R 158 at 163; with respect to a cognate provision: 
     
      
       
        
        “The object of the disclosure is to provide some specified source which can, if necessary, be followed up by the adversary or the court. In a case such as the present a broad reference may suffice such as to a bundle of documents so long as they are somehow identified and can be produced if necessary, or there is a proper explanation for their absence.” 
        
       
      
    45 Furthermore, as Palmer J said in Wily v Terra Cresta Business Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 949 at [11]: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … [T]he requirement of the section [s 75  
        Evidence Act 
        ] that the source of the information be revealed goes some way to assisting the Court in assessing the reliability of that evidence. Without any indication of the source of the evidence proffered on information and belief, the Court is unable to assess its weight nor can the opponent test the evidence or make any sensible submission as to its weight .” 
        
       
      
    46 The identification of a particular source, who is reasonably likely to have knowledge of the relevant fact, will ordinarily be sufficient to permit the Court to assess the weight to be given to the basis of the expressed suspicion and, therefore, to determine that reasonable grounds for the suspicion exist.  
     
      
    47 There is authority for the proposition that, where hearsay evidence is admissible, it is not necessary to name an informant with respect to every source of information. (See Hardie Rubber Co Pty Ltd v General Tyre & Rubber Co (1971) 129 CLR 521 at 536; Proctor Gamble Australia Pty Ltd v Medical Research Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 183 at [54]-[56].) 
     
      
    48 However, the extent of any failure to do so will affect the determination of whether reasonable grounds for the suspicion have been made out by the deponent. As Thomas J said, on the facts in Ahern supra at 167: 
     
      
       
        
        “The question as to what is a sufficient disclosure of sources must be decided according to the exigencies of each particular case, and the court’s discretion is not to be fettered. In the present case there were no apparent circumstances of urgency justifying the absence of disclosure of sources, and the bulk of the material may fairly be described as oppressive and embarrassing.” 
        
       
      
    49 The form of the affidavit in the present case, unlike the form considered in the IFTC case, served the purpose of enabling the Court to assess the reasonableness of the grounds on which the suspicion was based. 
     
      
    50 As the joint judgment of the High Court put it in a frequently cited passage in George v Rockett (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 112: 
     
      
       
        
        “When a statute prescribes that there must be ‘reasonable grounds’ for a state of mind – including suspicion and belief – it requires the existence of facts which are sufficient to induce that state of mind in a reasonable person.” 
        
       
      
    51 The evidence contained in the Facts Sheets presently under consideration satisfies me that the suspicion expressed by Mr Spark could reasonably be held. As I have indicated above, an officer who was involved in the investigation who, either directly or as part of a team, had access to all the information contained in the Facts Sheets, accepted responsibility for the statement of the facts which could constitute the relevant offence. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    52 The appellant sought costs of the appeal. The respondents played no role on the appeal, although they may have incurred some costs unknown to the Court. In those circumstances a costs order is not appropriate. 
     
      
    53 The Court could allow the appeal and remit the matter for further determination. However, the whole of the evidence is before the Court. There is a clear basis for a finding that reasonable grounds exist. The interests of the respondents can be protected by granting them liberty to apply to a judge of the Common Law Division to vary the order. The ancillary orders sought by the appellant, pursuant to s 12 of the Act, should be made, also subject to liberty to apply. 
     
      
    54 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
        
        The Court notes that the appellant has given the usual undertaking as to damages and orders. 
        
       
       
      1 Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal allowed.

      1990) of Quoc Hoi Vu, including the interest in property in the property described in Schedule 1 hereto.

        (b) Sinh Thi Tran. 
        
       
       
      5 Leave be granted to the Plaintiff to approach the Court to appoint a time and date for the examinations ordered in Order 5 above. 
       
       
      6 Pursuant to s 12(1)(c1) of the

    55 ALLSOP P: I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons of the Chief Justice in draft. I agree with the orders that his Honour proposes and with his reasons. I wish to add one matter. 
     
      
    56 In International Finance Trust Company v New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] NSWCA 291 at [38] I said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        The fact (without more) that Mr Moerman arrested Mr Agius on a first instance warrant on the Commonwealth charges set out in [3] of his affidavit does not provide reasonable grounds for the suspicions in [17] and [19] of his affidavit. No submission was put by the respondent that it did.” 
        
       
      
    57 Mr Temby QC submitted in this matter that the laying of the relevant charges here was a legitimate basis for concluding the reasonableness of the relevant suspicion. He appeared to call in aid what I said in the ITFC case at [38] in this respect. 
     
      
    58 I agree with the Chief Justice in his reasons that the laying of the charge is not an legitimate basis to ground a reasonable suspicion of the committal of the offences charged. Nothing I said in [38] in my reasons in the ITFC case was intended as sustenance or support for any such argument. Nor was I intending to draw any particular distinction between the first instance warrant on the Commonwealth charge and any other charge. 
     
      
    59 HODGSON JA: I agree with Spigelman CJ.

     TJ v R 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted of 16 charges of sexual assault upon three children. There were two trials before the same judge, each with a jury. The first trial was concerned with the allegations by KB and PD and the second with the allegations by AB, KB’s sister. The appellant was sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment of 9½ years with a non-parole period of 6 years. He appeals his conviction but does not seek to challenge his sentence. 
     
      
    2 The appellant was apprehended in Queensland on 1 September 2006 and extradited to NSW. He was charged on 4 September 2006 and committed for trial on 11 December 2006. On 16 May 2007 the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that a number of the charges on which the appellant had been committed should not proceed but at the same time that 2 further charges be laid ex officio, with two existing charges becoming charges in the alternative. On 8 June 2007 it was directed that another 2 of the charges on which he had been committed should not proceed. On 17 August 2007 it was directed that a further charge be laid ex officio with an existing charge becoming a charge in the alternative. The ex officio charges were count 7 on the first indictment and counts 2 and 4 on the second indictment. A separate trial application was made on 20 August 2007, which was granted. The appellant’s trials commenced on 21 August and 4 September 2007 respectively. Ultimately the appellant was found guilty of all 13 counts on the first indictment and counts 5 – 7 on the second indictment. The appellant was acquitted of counts 1 – 4 on the second indictment.  
     
      
    3 In both trials the Crown case was dependent on the jury accepting the uncorroborated accounts of the complainants. The only ground of appeal with respect to each trial is that the trial judge erred in failing to adequately warn the jury in accordance with Longman v The Queen (1989) HCA 60; (1989) 168 CLR 79. 
     
      
    4 The offences with which the appellant was charged were allegedly committed within various periods between 1991 and 1999. There was one exception being a charge for which the period in which the offence was alleged to have been committed was from 18 September 1999 – 17 October 2000. The time between the alleged commission of the offences and the appellant being charged was variously between 6 and 14 years.  
     
      
       
      Application of s 294 Criminal Procedure Act 
       
      
    5 The Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (“the Act”) in s 294, makes particular provision in relation to sexual offences. Section 294 of the Act was amended by the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual and Other Offences) Act 2006 (“the amending Act”). The amendments effected by that Act commenced on 1 January 2007. 
     
      
    6 Prior to the amendment s 294 provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) This section applies if, on the trial of a person for a prescribed sexual offence, evidence is given or a question is asked of a witness that tends to suggest: 
         
          
          (a) an absence of complaint in respect of the commission of the alleged offence by the person on whom the offence is alleged to have been committed, or 
           
          (b) delay by that person in making any such complaint. 
          
         
         
        (2) In circumstances to which this section applies, the Judge: 
         
          
          (a) must warn the jury that absence of complaint or delay in complaining does not necessarily indicate that the allegation that the offence was committed is false, and 
           
          (b) must inform the jury that there may be good reasons why a victim of a sexual assault may hesitate in making, or may refrain from making, a complaint about the assault.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    7 The amendments made in January 2007 inserted subsection (c) after s 294(2)(b). That subsection is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(c) must not warn the jury that delay in complaining is relevant to the victim’s credibility unless there is sufficient evidence to justify such a warning.” 
        
       
      
    8 In addition subsections (3) – (5) were included. They provided:  
     
      
       
        
        “(3) However, if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the delay in making a complaint by the person on whom the offence is alleged to have been committed is significant, and 
           
          (b) the Judge is satisfied that the person on trial for the offence has suffered a significant forensic disadvantage caused by that delay, and  
          
         
         
          
          the Judge may inform the jury (but only if a party to the proceedings so requests) of the nature of the disadvantage and of the need for caution in determining whether to accept, or give any weight to, the evidence or question referred to in subsection (1). 
          
         
         
        (4) For the purposes of subsection (3) (b), the factors that may be regarded as establishing a  
        significant forensic disadvantage 
         include, but are not limited to, the following: 
         
          
          (a) the fact that any potential witnesses have died or are not able to be located, 
           
          (b) the fact that any potential evidence has been lost or is otherwise unavailable. 
          
         
         
        (5) The mere passage of time is not in itself to be regarded as establishing a significant forensic disadvantage.” 
        
       
      
    9 Subsections (3) – (5) were repealed with effect from 1 January 2009 but were incorporated into s 165B of the Evidence Act 1995, which commenced from the same date.  
     
      
    10 The amending legislation included transitional provisions that are found in Part 12 of Schedule 2 to the amending Act. The relevant provision is in the following terms: 
     
      
      “51 Amendments 
       
        
        (1) The amendments made by the  
        Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual and Other Offences) 
         Act 2006 do not extend to any proceedings commenced before the commencement of the amendments and any such proceedings may continue as if that Act had not been enacted.” 
        
       
      
    11 As I have indicated, the amending Act commenced on 1 January 2007. 
     
      
       
      Had the proceedings commenced? 
       
      
    12 The Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides for a variety of “proceedings” including committal, bail, trial and sentence proceedings. The transitional provisions do not purport to distinguish between them. One controversy in the present case arises from the reference to “proceedings” in the transitional provisions and, in particular, whether the appellant’s “proceedings” had commenced by the time the amendments came into force. 
     
      
    13 A trial on indictment commences when an accused person is arraigned: R v Nicolaidis (1994) 33 NSWLR 362 at 367; Gilham v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 323; (2007) 178 A Crim R 72 at [78], [172] – [176]. The indictment is the originating process: R v Taylor [2003] NSWCCA 194 at [150], [155] – [156]; R v Halmi [2005] NSWCCA 2; (2005) 62 NSWLR 263 at [30]; R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 281, 64 NSWLR 10 at [219] – [220]. However, the transitional provision does not operate in relation to trials but rather in relation to “proceedings”. 
     
      
    14 The question of when proceedings commence in the context of the criminal justice system has been considered on a number of occasions. It has been held in NSW that criminal proceedings commence when a person is arrested and charged or an information is laid before a magistrate. In R v Hull (1989) 16 NSWLR 385 Gleeson CJ (with whom Grove and Studdert JJ agreed) said that criminal proceedings ordinarily commence when an accused person is arrested and charged. His Honour described three methods by which proceedings are commenced. He said (at 390): 
     
      
       
        
        “Criminal proceedings in this State are ordinarily, although not always, initiated by members of the police force or other officers who are charged with duties in relation to law enforcement. There are, broadly speaking, three methods by which the police or other law enforcement officials ordinarily proceed once a decision has been made that a person should be charged. In serious cases it is common for the proceedings to be commenced by arrests without warrant. A person who has been arrested must be taken before a magistrate without delay. The arrested person may be questioned and then charged. A second method involves the issue by a justice of a warrant for the arrest of a person where an information has been sworn before a justice. Such an information, which is usually laid by a police officer or other law enforcement official, will then result in an issue of a warrant. A third method, which can be used whether the offence in question is indictable or summary, involves the issue by a justice of a summons requiring the appearance in court of the person named in the information.” 
        
       
      
    15 Allerton v Director of Public Prosecutions (1991) NSWLR 24 550 followed Hull. The Court said that criminal proceedings were instituted when the criminal justice system was put in motion against an accused person, usually by one of the means described in Hull and noted (at 558) that “it is at (the time when the charge is laid) that the person is subject to the constraints of the criminal justice system.”  
     
      
    16 As I have identified the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 operates with respect to a variety of proceedings. However s 294 is only relevant to criminal trials and then only with respect to certain sexual offences. It was submitted by the Crown that because s 294 is only relevant to trials the reference to “proceedings” in the transitional provisions, at least in relation to s 294, should be understood as referring to trial proceedings. Because the trial did not commence until the appellant was arraigned before the jury on 21 August 2007, it was submitted that s 294 including subsections (2)(c) – (5) applied to the appellant’s trials in its amended form. 
     
      
    17 However, the appellant submitted that because other provisions of the amending Act affected proceedings other than trials and extended to committal proceedings the reference to “proceedings” in the present transitional provisions must be understood as the date of the commencement of the criminal process. The appellant drew attention to the fact that when s 294 was subsequently amended the relevant transitional provisions provided that the amendments were not to apply to a proceeding “the hearing of which began before the commencement of the amendment.” The reference to the “hearing of the proceedings”, in the appellant’s submission, indicates that the legislature intended to confine the operation of the amendments to a later trial. Because the instant transitional provision refers to proceedings without reference to a hearing it was submitted that it had a wider application and excluded any case where proceedings had been commenced by 1 January 2007. 
     
      
    18 A similar question has been considered by the Court of Appeal in Victoria. in R v Taylor (No 2) (2008) 18 VR 613. Taylor was concerned with an amendment to the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) analogous to that under consideration in the present appeal. The Victorian Court of Appeal held that an amendment to s 61 Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) operated in respect of a trial in which a presentment had been filed after the commencement of the amendments although the accused was charged prior to that date. However, the Victorian amendments could only have effect in relation to trials and no other proceedings. As I have indicated the position is different in the present case where the amending Act has effect in relation to a variety of proceedings.  
     
      
    19 In Taylor, Ashley JA (with whom Kellam JA and Hansen AJA agreed) stated at [20]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The amendments to (the relevant section) are only relevant to trials by jury of particular categories of criminal matters. (The transitional provision) is directed to the commencement of those provisions. Such trials cannot be held in the magistrate’s court – only in the County Court or the Supreme Court. For a trial to be had in one of those courts, the court must be seised of the matter. It is so seised, most commonly, when presentment is made in that court.” 
        
       
      
    20 Five judges of the Victorian Court of Appeal confirmed the decision in Taylor in R v BDX [2009] VSCA 28; (2009) 194 A Crim R 57.  
     
      
    21 Although my mind has fluctuated I have ultimately concluded that the transitional provision cannot be confined as was the case in Victoria. The provisions of the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual and Other Offences) Act 2006 affect all “proceedings” from committal through to sentencing. The transitional provision applies irrespective of the type of proceeding. Accordingly, to construe the transitional provision as applying only to a trial when considering its operation in relation to s 294 would require it to be given a different meaning than when, for example, considering its operation in relation to committal proceedings. 
     
      
    22 To my mind the only available approach to the meaning of “proceedings” in the transitional provisions, given the variety of contexts in which it must be applied, is that it does not operate with respect to a trial which follows the arrest and charging of the offender before 1 January 2007. The approach in Taylor cannot be applied to the New South Wales legislation (see Tillman v Attorney General for the State of New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 327; 178 A Crim R 133). 
     
      
    23 Although the counts commenced by ex-officio indictments were obviously commenced after 1 January 2007 to distinguish between those counts charged before that date and those after it would create impossible complications in a trial. Accordingly, I have concluded that s 294 without amendment was the relevant provision in the present case. 
     
      
       
      The ground of appeal 
       
      
    24 As I have indicated the same ground of appeal was advanced in respect of each trial. The trial judge accepted that in each case there was a forensic disadvantage occasioned to the appellant because of the delay in complaint. Her Honour made specific reference in the summing up to the difficulties faced by the appellant in the presentation of his defence. This included references to the difficulty in testing the evidence of the complainants, the inability of the defendant to adduce evidence of details about his movements at the time that the alleged offences were committed and the fact that the evidence that may have otherwise been adduced may now be lost. Although I have concluded otherwise, counsel for the appellant stated to her Honour that, “I think Longman has been surpassed by the recent amendments” to which her Honour replied in the affirmative. It appears from this exchange in the trial transcript that the summing up in each trial took the form which it did because of the understanding that s 294 applied in its amended form.  
     
      
    25 It was the appellant’s submission that the directions in each trial, which were very similar in form, failed to satisfactorily convey to the jury the dangers in convicting the appellant in the circumstances prescribed by Longman. The appellant relied on Hayne J’s statement in Crampton at [142]: 
     
      
       
        
        “But what has come to be known as a “ 
        Longman 
         warning” is not just a judicial comment of this kind, proper and appropriate as it may be. It is a warning to the jury that, because the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of so many years, it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinising the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. That warning was not given.” 
        
       
      
    26 While the appellant identified one ground of appeal, namely non-compliance with the requirements of Longman, the appellant contended that her Honour erred in several discrete ways. The substance of the appellant’s submission was that in failing to use the words “dangerous to convict” or words to that effect, her Honour did not signal that there was a real danger inherent in convicting the appellant in light of the disadvantages identified in the summing up. The appellant also submitted that the direction given by her Honour was not cast in the form of a warning but rather a caution, which did not “bear the imprint of the court’s authority and collective wisdom”. The appellant also complained that her Honour effectively “watered down” the meaning of “beyond reasonable doubt” as the standard by which the jury was required to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt. Her Honour referred to the jury being able to convict if they were “well satisfied” that the evidence of the complainant was true. 
     
      
    27 The appellant makes no complaint about her Honour’s identification of the forensic disadvantage to the jury; the complaint lies in the way in which her Honour directed the jury to consider the evidence in light of these difficulties. 
     
      
       
      Directions in the first trial 
       
      
    28 As I have indicated there was no dispute in either trial that there had been significant delay in complaint and that the delay may have caused difficulties for the appellant in defending himself. The allegations made by KB and PD covered the period from 18 September 1994 – 17 October 2000. In her summing up the trial judge indicated to the jury that there was no objective evidence that confirmed the testimony of either complainant in relation to the critical events.  
     
      
    29 The trial judge drew the jury’s attention to the lack of corroboration of the evidence of the complainants and instructed them that the Crown case relied on their acceptance of the complainant’s evidence. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I have already stated in this trial, in the case of each charge, the Crown case depends upon you accepting in substance the evidence of one person, either KB or PD. There is no independent, objective evidence confirming the relevant complainant’s testimony as to the critical events. There is only one person in relation to each charge who says that the accused behaved in this way. Therefore, in relation to each charge you should scrutinise the evidence of the complainant, KB or PD, very carefully before determining whether you are prepared to accept her evidence on the critical matters about which she has given evidence. You should examine her evidence in the context of all the other evidence, including the accused’s evidence.” 
        
       
      
    30 When referring to the delay between the alleged events and complaint, and the possible consequent effect of this on the evidence of the complainants, her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You should consider the delay between the alleged events and the first complaints that were made by each complainant. In the case of KB we are talking around about ten years from episode one, when she was about six, to the conversations with ES and/or JF, even though those conversations were in general terms. That is something you take into account as well. And then there was a delay beyond that of a couple of years until police were spoken to, and then twelve, thirteen months down the track we have the trial. You need to consider whether any of those delays may have meant that the recollection of K, and the same applies with P, the recollection of that witness and her evidence in this trial whether that could in any way be flawed and therefore unreliable … human recollection is often inaccurate and the likelihood of inaccuracy increases as time passes. That is something you need to consider in terms of whether recollection was an honest but mistaken recollection.” 
        
       
      
    31 With respect to the effect of delay her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Because of the delay in the accused learning of these allegations, he has been prejudiced in the conduct of his defence. I therefore caution you that it may be wrong for you to convict on either complainant’s evidence, unless, after scrutinising her evidence very carefully indeed, you are well satisfied that her evidence was both truthful and accurate. Because of the delay, it has been difficult for the accused to adequately test the evidence of either complainant … The complainants’ inability to recall precise dates of an incident, makes it difficult for the accused to throw doubt on her evidence by pointing to circumstances which contradict what she says occurred on particular dates. You can well imagine that, if a complaint has been made a week later, a particular date has been pinpointed, then, if the accused [was] with somebody else at that particular time, he would have the resources to defend that allegation … Had [he] learned of the allegations soon after the alleged offences, he may have been able to recall relevant details, which his barrister could have used, when cross-examining the complainant in question. He may have been able to find witnesses or marshal other evidence to contradict the complainant. He may have been able to call evidence, indeed, that he was somewhere else at the time  
        
       
       
        
        … 
         
         
        To summarise what I have said to you. The age of these matters, in other words, the fact that they … are alleged to have happened back in the 1990’s, the young age of the complainants, at least at the time of some of the events … and the delay in providing any notification of the allegations to the accused, has had an impact on the trial of these matters in two main ways. First, it may mean that the evidence of either or both of the complainants … is unreliable. Second, it has been more difficult for the accused to defend at least some of the allegations.” 
        
       
      
    32 The trial judge expressly addressed the question of forensic disadvantage experienced by the appellant. After describing the nature of the delay and the practical effect of the passage of time, her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is what we call a forensic disadvantage, suffered by the accused. The forensic disadvantage does not necessarily apply equally to all of the charges. It may have been a greater disadvantage, for example, in respect of the charges that were a longer period of time in the past. And, for example, in relation to the last charge concerning KB, when she stayed overnight at Coila after her twelfth birthday dinner, this occasion was pinpointed in time and the accused has a relatively clear recollection of this event. So the forensic disadvantage to him in respect of that charge is, of course, quite different from and much less than the forensic disadvantage in respect of other matters where the dating was much more general.” 
        
       
       
      Directions in the second trial 
       
      
    33 The critical parts of the summing up in the second trial were very similar to those in the first. In the course of her summing up to the jury in the second trial her Honour addressed the issue of corroboration of the complainant’s evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “…there is no independent objective evidence confirming the complainant’s testimony … because the Crown has the onus of proving each of these offences beyond reasonable doubt and because proof of each of the offences depends upon your acceptance of the evidence of A, you should scrutinize her evidence on each charge very carefully before deciding whether you are prepared to accept her evidence on the critical matters about which she gave evidence. 
        
       
      
    34 Her Honour addressed delay in complaint and its consequences for the accused in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Because of the delay in the accused’s learning of the allegations, he has been prejudiced in the conduct of his defence. I therefore caution you that it may be wrong for you to convict on the complainant’s evidence unless, after scrutinizing her evidence very carefully indeed, you are well satisfied that her evidence was both honest and accurate. 
        
       
       
        
        Because of the delay, the complainant’s evidence cannot be adequately tested by the accused. Had the allegations been made and the case prosecuted soon after the alleged incidents, the complainant would be expected to have a clear and detailed memory of events. The complainant’s inability to recall precise dates or details of the circumstances surrounding both of the alleged episodes makes it difficult for the accused to throw doubt on her evidence, by pointing to circumstances which contradict her evidence as to what she said occurred on particular dates, and contradicting details of incidents as she described them. Had the accused learned of the allegations soon after the alleged offences, he may have been able to recall relevant details which his barrister could have used to attack the credibility of the complainant. Further, had the accused learned of the allegations soon after the alleged events, he may have been able to find witnesses or other evidence to contradict the complainant. He may have been able to recall what he was doing at the time and call evidence to support his contention about what he was dong. 
        
       
       
        
        In this case, had the accused learned of the complainant’s allegations soon after the alleged events, he may have been able to marshal evidence to contradict the complainant. For example, he said that he was self employed at one stage … he kept records for tax purposes … that sort of record, if he had a precise date, might have been able to assist him to argue or call a witness to say that he was somewhere else at the time on that day when such and such was alleged to have occurred.” 
        
       
       
      The required direction in New South Wales 
       
      
    35 The form of directions that a trial judge must give in a trial involving allegations of sexual assault has been the subject of considerable discussion in various cases before the amendments to s 294. In most trials for sexual assault the Crown case is confined to the evidence of the complainant. It is also common that complaint is made to the authorities a considerable period after the alleged assault. Further complexities are added when the complainant, as is regrettably too often the case, is a person who alleges that they were assaulted at a young and sometimes very young age. 
     
      
    36 The relevant line of authority in Australia considering the direction to be given in circumstances where an accused person is disadvantaged by a delay in complaint commenced with Longman. In that case the complainant alleged that her stepfather had sexually interfered with her during two periods, the first being from 1962 – 1963 and the second from 1966 – 1967. Complaint was first made in August 1987, constituting a delay of up to 25 years. The case was tried in Western Australia where the Evidence Act 1906 (WA) had been amended to provide that a judge was not required by any rule of law or practice to give a warning to a jury to the effect that it is unsafe to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of a complainant. A warning could only be given where a judge was satisfied that it was justified in the circumstances.  
     
      
    37 Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ held notwithstanding the statutory abolition of the rule of practice that had developed, by reason of the disadvantage to the accused occasioned by the delay a strong warning was required to be given by the trial judge. Their Honours’ joint judgment identified the general principle (at 89): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The general law requires a warning to be given whenever a warning is necessary to avoid a perceptible risk of miscarriage of justice arising from the circumstances of the case."" 
        
       
      
    38 Later (at 91) their Honours said that the trial judge was required to give “not merely a comment but a warning.” 
     
      
    39 The frequently cited passage from the joint reasons that established the requirements of the “Longman warning” is (at 91): 
     
      
       
        
        “The jury should have been told that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of more than 20 years, it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinising the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. To leave a jury without such a full appreciation of the danger was to risk a miscarriage of justice. The jury were told simply to consider the relative credibility of the complainant and the appellant without either a warning or a mention of the factors relevant to the evaluation of the evidence. That was not sufficient.” 
        
       
      
    40 Deane and McHugh JJ delivered separate judgments. Both of their Honours discussed their view as to the possible unreliability of a child’s recollection and suggested a warning that extended beyond that required by the joint judgment. A warning purporting to address the fragility of youthful recollection and the fallibility of childhood memories as their Honours suggested has been described by Kirby J as “the extended Longman direction”: JJB v R [2006] NSWCCA 126; (2006) 161 A Crim R 187 at [36]. Spigelman CJ at [2] in the same case identified the so-called “extended direction” as not having authoritative force. The Chief Justice reiterated the view that the statements of Deane and McHugh JJ do not form any part of the “Longman direction” in DRE v R [2006] NSWCCA 280; (2006) 164 A Crim R 400 at [7].  
     
      
    41 Although in one passage Deane J uses the composite “caution or warning” it is notable that he is the only judge to do so. McHugh J’s judgment is replete with the word “warning”. Insofar as none of the judgments apart from that of Deane J refer to a “caution” it would seem although I accept that the contrary is open the majority contemplated that the trial judge should given a “warning” in terms. 
     
      
    42 The issue was again considered by the High Court in Crampton v R (2000) HCA 60; (2000) 206 CLR 161. Crampton was concerned with an uncorroborated complaint made approximately 19 years after the relevant event was alleged to have occurred. The trial judge in that case did not use the word “warning” and made no reference to the danger, given the delay, of the jury acting on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant. In this Court the direction was accepted to be appropriate. It was described by Barr J, who wrote the leading judgment as a “compact summing up that contained several appropriate warnings”. 
     
      
    43 The High Court took a different view. 
     
      
    44 Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ wrote a joint judgment. Their Honours considered the passage in Longman at p 91 and said at [44] – [45]: 
     
      
       
        
        “As the appellant submits, the first reference by the trial judge to delay was followed by an observation which could have diminished the effect of the caution - it did fall short of a warning - against acting on the evidence of the complainant of a complaint so long delayed. To say what her Honour did in the first passage from her summing up that we have quoted was to say too little, too unemphatically, and less than what Longman required be said in the circumstances of this case. The redirection, which we have also quoted, suffered from some of the same or similar deficiencies. 
        
       
       
        
        The trial judge should have instructed the jury that the appellant was, by reason of the very great delay, unable adequately to test and meet the evidence of the complainant. Her Honour should not have offered the qualification that she did in relation to the remarks she did make about the delay. An accused's defence will frequently be an outright denial of the allegations. That is not a reason for disparaging the relevance and importance of a timely opportunity to test the evidence of a complainant, to locate other witnesses, and to try to recollect precisely what the accused was doing on the occasion in question. In short, the denial to an accused of the forensic weapons that reasonable contemporaneity provides, constitutes a significant disadvantage which a judge must recognise and to which an unmistakable and firm voice must be given by appropriate directions. Almost all of the passage of the majority in Longman to which we have referred (with appropriate adaptations to the circumstances of this case, including that because of the passage of so many years, it would be dangerous to convict on the complainant's evidence alone without the closest scrutiny of the complainant's evidence) should have been put to the jury."" 
        
       
      
    45 Kirby J drew the distinction between a warning and a comment, which his Honour said carries less force at [126]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “ 
        Comment 
         will simply remind the jury of matters frequently within common experience which they may ordinarily be taken to know but might have forgotten or overlooked.  
        Warnings 
         derive from the special experience of the law. The specific difficulties that an accused will have, in circumstances of significant delay, in defending himself or herself in a criminal trial, include securing evidence (comprising now scientific as well as lay evidence) and gathering information promptly with which to test and challenge the evidence of the accuser.” 
        
       
      
    46 His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “In view of my primary conclusion, it is not obligatory upon me to elaborate my views concerning the  
        warning 
         required in the present case. However, as otherwise the disposal of that question by the Court of Criminal Appeal might be thought to be correct, I should say that I consider that the directions in this case were defective by the standards of  
        Longman 
        . I say this with respect to the trial judge whose conduct of the trial was otherwise admirably fair.  
        
       
       
        
        The  
        warning 
         in a case involving a long delay between an alleged offence and a complaint is, in part, an element in the balance required by the law in such matters. In overseas jurisdictions courts have been more willing than they appear to have been in Australia to provide a permanent stay of proceedings to protect accused persons from the injustices that can arise in attempting to mount a defence to such charges years, or even decades, after an alleged offence occurred. But this has been so, in part, because Australian courts know that  
        Longman 
         obliges trial judges, in cases such as the present, not only to comment about the difficulties which the long delay in complaint presents but specifically to warn the jury, in clear and emphatic terms, of the dangers that may be inherent in such a trial.  
        
       
       
        
        The warning required by  
        Longman 
         must be, in the words of the joint reasons in this case, ""unmistakable and firm"". It must be related to the evidence and derived from forensic experience. The need for such a warning is demonstrated by the facts of a case such as the present. In practical terms, after twenty years, the appellant's defence could never rise much above a mere denial and protest of innocence. He had lost the chance of obtaining effective evidence from other children who were in the class at the time of the alleged offence concerning his alleged conduct. He had lost the chance of procuring effective evidence from other teachers said to have been coming and going near the class at times relevant to the events alleged. He had lost the chance of resolving, with certainty, the conflict of evidence about the nature and appearance, twenty years earlier, of locations relevant to the charges against him. He had lost the opportunity to collect forensic scientific evidence, such as was available in 1978, concerning the presence (or absence) of semen on the floor of the storeroom. He had lost the opportunity to respond effectively, by the testimony of storekeepers, to evidence that he had purchased lollies and other goods to favour the first complainant.  
         
         
        Twenty years after the alleged offence, the first complainant was an adult whose life's experience, character and motivations would have been unknown to the appellant. The appellant would thus be at a great disadvantage in testing events that may have affected the first complainant's recollection or reliability. Repeated answers to questions, searching the detail of the first complainant's testimony, such as ‘I can't remember’ or ‘it's too long ago’ made it extremely difficult to test that evidence in an effective way.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The idea that these serious disadvantages are unimportant and that the jury, unaided, will somehow sort things out by simply resolving the claims and denials in oath against oath must be firmly rejected. That idea is contrary to the repeated authority of this court in and since  
        Longman 
        . The jury need the assistance of the trial judge to warn, from the law's long experience, that trials with such potentially grave consequences for liberty and reputation need to be fought with forensic weapons. The passage of time — especially great time — may make it difficult, or impossible, to secure such weapons for an adequate defence. A jury may not understand this. A judge will. And the law requires that the judge warn the jury in clear and unmistakable terms.” 
         
         
        (The emphasis is that of Kirby J) 
        
       
      
    47 Hayne J wrote a separate judgment. His Honour criticised the approach taken by this Court. His Honour stated that it was insufficient to view Longman as requiring that a trial judge must “bring home to the jury the need for caution and careful examination of the evidence” or that the delay in complaint posed some difficulties for the accused. His Honour said that this did not reflect what Longman required. His Honour described those requirements in the following passage (at [142]): 
     
      
       
        
        “But what has come to be known as a "" 
        Longman 
         warning"" is not just a judicial  
        comment 
         of this kind, proper and appropriate as it may be. It is a  
        warning  
        to the jury that, because the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of so many years, it would be  
        dangerous to convict 
         on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinising the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. That warning was not given.” 
         
         
        (The emphasis is that of Hayne J) 
        
       
      
    48 His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “The leading judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal [1999] NSWCCA 130 was given by Barr J. Although reference was made to  
        Longman 
        , it seems to have been treated as holding no more than that a trial judge must ""bring home to the jury the need for caution and careful examination of the evidence"" [1999] NSWCCA 130 at [22] and, in particular, that delay in complaining produced difficulties for the appellant [1999] NSWCCA 130 at [28]. That, as I have pointed out, is not a sufficient or complete statement of what was held in  
        Longman 
        . There was a miscarriage of justice at trial.  
        
       
      
    49 The contrast with his Honour’s language in [142] and that in [143] is plain. Amongst other matters his Honour italicised the word “warning” in [142]. He does not accept that a caution is appropriate and said this Court erred when it accepted that the obligation in Longman was fulfilled by bringing home to the jury the need for caution. 
     
      
    50 In Doggett v R [2001] HCA 46; (2001) 208 CLR 343 the High Court returned to these issues. That case was distinguished by the fact that unlike Longman and Crampton, Doggett concerned a situation where, despite significant delay in complaint being made, there was evidence capable of corroborating the account of the complainant in the form of a recorded conversation between the complainant and the alleged offender. The majority (Gaudron, Callinan and Kirby JJ, Gleeson CJ and McHugh J dissenting) held that the presence of evidence capable of corroborating the account of the complainant did not of itself obviate the need for a Longman direction: [51] per Gaudron and Callinan JJ. 
     
      
    51 The question of the requirements of Longman have been considered in this Court on a number of occasions. In R v BWT [2002] NSWCCA 60; (2002) 54 NSWLR 241 Sully J (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Dowd J agreed) provided at [95] of what his Honour described as “practical guidelines” to be observed by trial judges. His Honour, having considered the High Court decisions, identified at [95], subparagraph (3), a series of characteristics that must manifest in a direction in order for it to satisfy the requirements of Longman. His Honour’s reasons have particular significance as they were endorsed by Kirby J with whom McHugh J expressly agreed in Dyers v The Queen (2002) HCA 45; (2002) 210 CLR 285 at [55] (see Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd (2007) 230 CLR 89 at [134]). Sully J said:  
     
      
       
        
        “(a) The direction must be cast in the form of a  
        warning 
        . Any form of expression which is thought to have the character of a  
        comment 
        , or even of a  
        caution 
         will not sufficiently comply with what is required by law.  
        
       
       
        
        It seems to me to follow that any trial Judge who is framing a  
        Longman 
         direction ought to ensure that the direction is framed, in terms, as a  
        warning 
        .  
        
       
       
        
        (b) That which is to be warned against is, to return to the majority judgment in  
        Longman 
         itself:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of [the particular period relevant in the particular trial], it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinising the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, was satisfied of its truth and accuracy.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The approach of the majority Justices in both  
        Crampton 
         and  
        Doggett 
         seems to me to entail that a trial Judge who is framing a  
        Longman 
         direction must ensure that the final form of the direction to the jury covers in terms the following propositions:  
        first 
        , that because of the passage of time the evidence of the complainant cannot be adequately tested;  
        secondly 
        , that it would be, therefore, dangerous to convict on that evidence alone;  
        thirdly 
        , that the jury is entitled, nevertheless, to act upon that evidence alone if satisfied of its truth and accuracy;  
        fourthly 
        , that the jury cannot be so satisfied without having first scrutinised the evidence with great care;  
        fifthly 
        , that the carrying out of that scrutiny must take into careful account any circumstances which are peculiar to the particular case and which have a logical bearing upon the truth and accuracy of the complainant’s evidence; and  
        sixthly 
        , that every stage of the carrying out of that scrutiny of the complainant’s evidence must take serious account of the warning as to the dangers of conviction. 
         
         
        …  
         
         
        (c) Not only must the substance of the warning be carefully and correctly focused, but the form of the warning, also, must be carefully and correctly framed.” 
         
        (emphasis in original) 
        
       
      
    52 The endorsement by Kirby J was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “I hesitate to embark once again on this territory. I sympathise with the difficulty that trial judges and courts of criminal appeal face in conforming to the various opinions stated in this Court in relation to the  
        Longman  
        requirement eg  
        Jones v The Queen  
        [1997] HCA 12; (1997) 191 CLR 439;  
        Crampton v The Queen  
        [2000] HCA 60; (2000) 206 CLR 161;  
        Doggett v The Queen  
        [2001] HCA 46; (2001) 75 ALJR 1290; 182 ALR 1. Differing emphasis has been placed at different times by different members of this Court upon different parts of the reasoning in  
        Longman 
         and in particular the considerations mentioned by Deane J  
        Longman  
        [1989] HCA 60; (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 101 and McHugh J  
        Longman 
         [1989] HCA 60; (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 108-109 in their separate concurring reasons in that case. However, I believe that it is fair to say that the several appeals (and many more applications for special leave) in which the point has been re-agitated have only come before this Court because of what seems, with respect, to be a reluctance on the part of some judges to conform to the law established in  
        Longman 
        . Some judges have even confessed that they find obedience to the  
        Longman  
        direction to be ""unpalatable""  
        R v BWT  
        [20002] NSWCCA 60 at [97]. In my opinion, a correct statement of the present law is set out in the analysis of Sully J, in the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        R v BWT 
         [2002] NSWCCA 60 at [95]. It is, and it is expressed to be, stringent.  
        
       
      
    53 R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 was decided before the High Court decisions in Crampton and Doggett. Spigelman CJ (with whom Sully and Ireland JJ agreed) described the basic requirements of the warning at [17]: 
     
      
       
        
        “There are two features of the Longman warning which should be emphasised. First, the jury is to be told  
        why 
         it is ‘dangerous to convict’ namely, the delay meant that the evidence of the complainant could not be ‘adequately tested’. Second, the jury is to be told  
        how 
         they should go about their task because of the identified danger namely, ‘scrutinize the evidence with great care’.” 
        
       
       
      “Dangerous to convict” requirement 
       
      
    54 This Court has applied the dicta of Sully J in BWT on many occasions. The appellant relied upon them in the present case. Sully J was firmly of the view that the specific words that it would be “dangerous to convict” form an essential part of the warning. His Honour reiterated that view in WSP at [85] subparagraph (4) and said that the failure to give a “dangerous to convict” direction where it is warranted constitutes a miscarriage of justice: WSP at [93].  
     
      
    55 Notwithstanding the guidance provided by BWT, later decisions of this Court including DRE have determined that there remains significant flexibility in the precise words to be used by the trial judge and that no set form of words is required in giving the warning. The adequacy of the direction must be considered in the context of the proceedings: DRE at [14] per Spigelman CJ; R v DBG [2002] NSWCCA 328 at [30] per Howie J; R v Kesisyan [2003] NSWCCA 259 at [8] per Meagher JA.  
     
      
    56 Simpson J made the following observation in DRE v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 280; (2006) 164 A Crim R 400 at [59] – [60]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although many may have made the attempt, no definitive statement of the minimum requirements of a Longman direction has yet emerged. In particular, there is no unanimity, and no definitive decision, on whether the principle mandates the use of the formula “dangerous to convict” and whether ‘unsafe to convict’ is its equivalent. 
         
         
        In my opinion this appeal ought to be approached on the basis that a  
        Longman 
         or  
        Crampton 
         direction should be tailored to the factual circumstances of the case in which the question arises. Whether any direction concerning the effects of delay on the capacity of the accused to defend himself or herself is adequate will depend upon the infinite variety of circumstances that go to make up the facts of a criminal trial.” 
        
       
      
    57 In DRE Spigelman CJ observed at [14] that the requirements of Longman are such that there exists a temptation to parse and analyse the content of the summing up to suit the appellant’s submission. The Chief Justice was of the view that it is a temptation that ought to be resisted and that in determining the appropriate form of the direction, it remains important to understand the whole of the context in which the warning must be given. 
     
      
    58 The critical consideration when assessing the adequacy of an impugned Longman direction is not whether a particular form of words is used in conformity with the joint judgment in Longman but whether the substance of the direction given by the trial judge in the context and circumstances of the particular case conveyed the necessary features of the warning as prescribed by the High Court.  
     
      
    59 Decisions of this Court confirm that the particular words “dangerous to convict” are not an essential requirement of the Longman direction: R v WSP [2005] NSWCCA 427, Robinson v R [2006] NSWCCA 192; (2006) 162 A Crim R 88 at [16] - [19] per Spigelman CJ, DPW v R [2006] NSWCA 295; 164 A Crim R 583 at [24] per Barr J, Sepulveda v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 379; (2006) 167 A Crim R 108 at [180] per Johnson J. Whether those words ought to form part of the direction will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case: Sepulveda at [180]. In some circumstances the use of the words “dangerous to convict” may be undesirable. A potential unintended consequence of the use of the “dangerous to convict” formulation is that the jury may incorrectly understand those words to be in effect a direction to acquit: Robinson at [19].  
     
      
    60 To my mind the use of the phrase “wrong to convict” by the trial judge in each of the appellant’s trials was satisfactory in the present circumstances. The trial judge gave both juries a lengthy dissertation with respect to the difficulties faced by the appellant. By being told that it may be “wrong to convict” the appellant in those circumstances the jury was adequately warned that it risked error if it did not pay heed to the direction: Sheehan v R [2006] NSWCCA 233 at [111] per Kirby J. The direction conveyed to the jury that it risked a miscarriage of justice if it convicted the appellant without scrutinising very carefully the evidence of the complainants. To my mind nothing was lost to the appellant by the use of those words as an alternative to “dangerous to convict”. 
     
      
       
      Requirement that a “warning” be given 
       
      
    61 The appellant submitted that the direction given by her Honour was not expressly described as “warning” but rather was expressed as a “caution”, which did not “bear the imprint of the court’s authority and collective wisdom” concerning the dangers of convicting the appellant in circumstances where he was disadvantaged by considerable delay.  
     
      
    62 As I have indicated above, the decisions of this Court confirm that a trial judge is not constrained to a particular formulation of the substance of the warning when delivering a Longman direction to a jury. The trial judge must adapt the summing up to conform to the circumstances of the case at hand. However, there is a distinction to be drawn between the requirement that the direction be expressed as a “warning”, that word being used, and the content of that warning. When the question has arisen this Court has required the direction to include the word “warning”. I refer to these decisions in the following paragraphs. This approach conforms with the statements in Crampton by Kirby J at [125]-[129] and Hayne J at [142] that the direction must be expressed in the terms of a “warning” confirmed by Kirby J’s endorsement in Dyers of the judgment of Sully J. in BWT. I repeat portion of Sully J’s remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) The direction must be cast in the form of  
        warning 
        . Any form of expression which is thought to have the character of a  
        comment, 
         or even of a  
        caution 
         will not sufficiently comply with what is required by law. 
        
       
       
        
        It seems to me to follow that any trial judge who is framing a  
        Longman  
        direction ought to ensure that the direction is framed, in terms, as a  
        warning. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    63 His Honour further observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “(c) Not only must the substance of the warning be carefully and correctly focussed, but the form of the warning, also, must be carefully and correctly framed.” 
        
       
      
    64 In R v WRC [2002] NSWCCA 210; (2002) 130 A Crim R 89, Kirby J (with whom Greg James J agreed, Hodgson JA dissenting) considered BWT. The alleged shortcomings of the direction given in that case included a failure to give a “warning”. His Honour said at [146]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The directions given in the first trial, in my view, plainly did not conform, or substantially conform, to these requirements. The direction was not framed as a warning.” 
        
       
      
    65 In JJB [2006] NSWCCA 126; 161 A Crim R 187 Kirby J cited BWT and observed at [42]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where there has been substantial delay, there must be a warning, not simply a comment  
        or a caution 
        . It must be correctly focused and framed.” 
        
       
       
        
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    66 Spigelman CJ has indicated that the requirement to administer a “warning” in terms is a strict one. This is made plain in DRE [2006] NSWCCA 280; 164 A Crim R 400 (at [18]). His Honour contrasted the position in New South Wales with Western Australia: Christophers v The Queen [2000] WASCA 308; (2000) 23 WAR 106 at [37]; Crisafio v R [2003] WASCA 104; (2003) 27 WAR 169 at [1], [30] - [31]; RBK v The Queen [2004] WASCA 216 at [34]; Angliss v The State of Western Australia [2005] WASCA 162 at [15]; Carroll v The State of Western Australia [2004] WASCA 254 at [184] - [185]. The Chief Justice said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The second matter on which reliance was placed was the proposition that at no stage did his Honour specifically “warn” the jury of the real disadvantages that the accused had suffered by reason of the delay. In this Court, in contrast with the position in Western Australia, a strict approach has been taken to the requirement that what must be conveyed to the jury is a “warning” in terms. (see  
        R v BWT  
        (2002) 54 NSWLR 241 at [95]. The other case law is referred to in  
        R v WSP  
        [2005] NSWCCA 427 at [3] and [77]-[85]).” 
        
       
      
    67 In WSP, the trial judge told the jury that she was administering a warning. However complaint was made that the direction that followed was not in substance a warning but was in the nature of a comment or caution: [177]. This Court decided that despite purporting to give a warning, her Honour’s direction did not carry the strength of a warning and was accordingly insufficient: [183]. It follows that even where the word “warning” is used the requirement that the direction carry the force of a warning is a stringent one.  
     
      
    68 Resort to a dictionary indicates that in some circumstances the words “caution” and “warning” are synonymous. However, when, to my mind a judge is providing directions to a jury about the necessary approach to assessing the evidence against an accused a “caution” delivered by the judge has significantly less force than a “warning”. A caution as to a prospective danger is less diverting than a warning. So much is plain from the language used on public signage and in many other areas of human discourse. 
     
      
       
      Determination of the present appeal 
       
      
    69 The critical portion of her Honour’s summing up in the first trial is extracted above at [31]. I repeat it:  
     
      
       
        
        “I therefore caution you that it may be wrong for you to convict on either complainant’s evidence, unless, after scrutinising her evidence very carefully indeed, you are well satisfied that her evidence was both truthful and accurate.” 
        
       
      
    70 The relevant excerpt from the second trial is almost identical and appears above at [34]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I therefore caution you that it may be wrong for you to convict on the complainant’s evidence unless, after scrutinizing her evidence very carefully indeed, you are well satisfied that her evidence was both honest and accurate.” 
        
       
      
    71 The direction was framed as a “caution” and not as a “warning” and accordingly it lacked the force required by the High Court in both Longman and Crampton. Although some people were of the view that the High Court may have been excessively cautious, a view reflected in the subsequent legislative intervention, in this case the trial judge was bound to frame the direction in the terms of a warning rather than a caution. 
     
      
    72 There is one further matter. The delay in the present case was not of the order in Longman and Crampton. However the Crown case was confined to the evidence of the complainants. Before the jury could convict the appellant in either case they were required to be satisfied of the complainant’s evidence beyond reasonable doubt. It was not, as her Honour said, that it may be wrong for the jury to convict unless well satisfied of the complainant’s evidence. Rather it was not open to them to convict unless satisfied of the complainant’s evidence to the relevant standard. The use of the words “may” and “well satisfied” reduced the force of the direction which was already diminished by being expressed as a caution. In the context of the trials and applying the approach required by the High Court, the direction given did not ensure that the appellant received a fair trial.  
     
      
       
      Rule 4 
       
      
    73 There was no objection to or request for redirection made by counsel for the appellant following her Honour’s summing up to the jury and rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. The lack of an objection or request was no doubt due to the fact that both the judge and counsel were operating under the assumption that the amendments to s 294 applied to the trials. Nevertheless the appellant submitted to this Court that the failure to give directions which complied with the law relevant to his trials meant that they had miscarried and this Court should intervene.  
     
      
    74 In many cases of sexual assault where the issue in the appeal has been the deficiency of the direction given by the trial judge a conviction has been set aside. Because the Crown case is generally confined to the evidence of a complainant a deficiency in the directions with respect to that evidence is likely to lead to that outcome. As I have already indicated in the present matters the Crown case was entirely dependent on the complainant’s evidence. The jury did not have appropriate guidance when considering the complainants’ evidence with the consequence that the conviction must be set aside and new trials ordered. To my mind the deficiencies in her Honour’s directions were such that irrespective of the failure of counsel to take the point the trial has miscarried and this Court must intervene: R v Lyberoupolos [2002] NSWCCA 280 at [53]. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    75 In my opinion leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal upheld. The convictions should be quashed and new trials should be ordered. 
     
      
    76 HIDDEN J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum J. I agree with the Chief Judge’s conclusion that this case was subject to s 294 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 as it stood before the commencement of the 2006 amendments. However, I agree with McCallum J that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons her Honour has given. The Longman direction in each trial was adequate. 
     
      
    77 The distinction made in the High Court authorities between a comment or caution, on the one hand, and a warning, on the other, reflects the twofold requirement of a Longman direction: firstly, to convey to the jury the need for careful assessment of the evidence because of the forensic disadvantage occasioned to the accused by delay and, secondly, to alert the jury expressly to the consequent risk of wrongful conviction. The directions of the trial judge in the present case met both of those requirements.  
     
      
    78 I agree with McCallum J that the proposition that the second requirement necessitates the use of the word “warn” or “warning”, and that no synonymous expression would suffice, is not supported by authority in the High Court or in this Court. It is not to the point that the word “warning” is consistently used in the various judgments in the High Court (or that in passages of the judgments of Kirby and Hayne JJ in Crampton the word is italicised). In particular, I agree with McCallum J that what Sully J had to say in BWT at [95] (3)(a) was directed to the substance of the warning and did not dictate that the word “warning” (or its grammatical variants) should be invariably used. Such a requirement would be inconsistent with the flexibility in the expression of the warning recognised in the decisions of this Court to which the Chief Judge has referred.  
     
      
    79 Nor should the endorsement of Sully J’s judgment by Kirby J in Dyers be understood as embracing such a requirement. In Dyers itself the trial judge had commented to the jury upon the effect of delay but had said nothing which could amount to a warning in the relevant sense: the passage from the summing-up is set out in the judgment of Callinan J at [111]. Callinan J held that, in the circumstances of the case, what the judge had said about delay was sufficient: [130]. Kirby J was of the same view, concluding that, while it would have been prudent for the judge to have given a warning, the jury’s verdict should not be disturbed on that ground alone: [58]. As I understand it, it was with that reasoning of Kirby J that McHugh J expressed his agreement at [47]. 
     
      
    80 As the Chief Judge has said, and as one would expect, Sully J’s useful analysis of the authorities in BWT has been referred to in a number of subsequent decisions of this Court. However, I agree with McCallum J’s analysis of those decisions. For the most part, in the appeals which succeeded on the basis of an inadequate Longman direction, the complaint was that the directions amounted to comment but did not convey a warning at all. The impugned passages from the summing-up in each case are to be found in BWT itself at [63] (8), in SJB at [33], in WRC at [127] and [129], and in GEA at [4]. In WSP, the court was concerned with the adequacy of what purported to be a warning but whether the word “warning” was used was not an issue. GS turned on an aspect of the direction which is not relevant for present purposes. 
     
      
    81 In particular, I agree with McCallum J’s analysis of the decision in DRE. It is apparent from Simpson J’s summary of the appellant’s arguments in that case at [68] that the failure to use the term “warning” at the relevant point in the trial judge’s directions did not loom large. It was but one of a number of complaints which founded a submission that the directions as a whole failed to provide the emphatic guidance which Longman requires. It formed no part of the reasoning of Adams J in concluding that the directions were inadequate. It achieved prominence only in the judgment of Spigelman CJ, but I agree with McCallum J about the way in which the Chief Justice’s observations should be understood. Certainly, the judgment is far from an adequate foundation for a principle that the use of the term “warning” is essential. 
     
      
    82 The Chief Judge refers to DPW and Sepulveda, in which it was held that the expression “dangerous to convict” is not essential and, indeed, may be undesirable. In both cases reference was made to observations to that effect by Spigelman CJ in Robinson (which was not a sexual assault case). However, it might be noted that, yet again, the directions in both cases amounted to comment but did not contain a warning: relevant passages of the summing-up are to be found in DPW at [13] and Sepulveda at [154] – [156] and [159] – [161]. Nevertheless, in each case the Court found that, in the circumstances, the directions were adequate.  
     
      
    83 I agree with McCallum J that the trial judge’s use of the word “may” and the expression “well satisfied” did not reduce the force of her directions. 
     
      
    84 McCALLUM J: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in draft. I share his Honour’s view that the transitional provisions in respect of the 2006 amendments to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 should not be construed so as to have different meanings in different contexts. I agree with his Honour’s conclusion on that basis that the applicable provision in the present case was s 294 of the Act as it stood prior to the commencement of the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual and Other Offences) Act 2006.  
     
      
    85 In the circumstances of the present case, the consequence is that a Longman direction was required, contrary to the view expressed by counsel for the appellant at the first trial (T609). The Chief Judge has reached the conclusion that the direction given by the trial Judge in each trial lacked the force required of such a direction.  
     
      
    86 The reasons of the Chief Judge turn on his Honour’s conclusion that the direction was framed as a “caution” and not as a “warning”, together with his Honour’s view that the use of the words “may” and “well satisfied” further reduced the force of the direction. With great respect to his Honour, I do not agree.87 As to the first matter, his Honour has expressed the view that, although a trial Judge is not constrained to a particular formulation of the substance of the warning, the authorities require a Longman direction to include the word “warning”. I have reached a different view on that issue.  
     
      
    88 The joint judgment in Longman (Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) drew a distinction between a “warning” and a “comment”. Their Honours said at 91: 
     
      
       
        
        “But there is one factor which may not have been apparent to the jury and which therefore required not merely a comment but a warning to be given to them: see  
        Reg. v. Spencer. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    89 The footnote cites page 141 of Spencer [1987] AC 128 where Lord Ackner explained the rationale for an obligatory “full warning” in certain circumstances by reference to the fact that the risk in question may not be apparent to the jury. A consideration of the speeches of Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone (especially at 134G) and Lord Ackner (especially at 138) in Spencer confirms the likelihood that the distinction intended to be referred to in the joint judgment in Longman was between, on the one hand, comment or advice as to the need to proceed with caution and, on the other hand, a specific warning to the jury of “the dangers they would be incurring if they did not do so” (Spencer at 134H). 
     
      
    90 It may be noted in passing that, in his separate judgment in Longman, Deane J used the terms “caution” and “warning” apparently as synonyms.  
     
      
    91 The suggestion in later authorities that a “caution” is something less than a “warning” (and more like mere comment) appears to have its genesis in the adoption of the word “caution” to describe the comments made by the Judge to the jury in the trial of Alan Crampton. In the decision of the High Court in Crampton, it was said at [44] of the joint judgment (Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ) (my emphasis): 
     
      
       
        
        “As the appellant submits, the first reference by the trial judge to delay was followed by an observation which could have diminished the effect of the caution -  
        it did fall short of a warning 
         - against acting on the evidence of the complainant of a complaint so long delayed”. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    92 In order to understand the import of the distinction drawn in that passage, it is necessary to consider the comments of the trial Judge in full. They are set out at paragraphs [32] and [33] of the joint judgment as follows (with my emphasis of the key passages): 
     
      
       
      “32 In the course of summing up to the jury her Honour made these comments: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ‘ 
          Clearly you have to look carefully 
           at the circumstances in which there has been no complaint at the time. But those matters to which I referred are also matters which you must take into consideration and give some thought to. You had the chance to observe both young men in the witness box and to assess their level of sophistication, even now in their early thirties.  
          It is important that you look 
           at the way in which they told you about these matters and the explanation they gave for not having complained earlier, when they were asked about those issues in cross-examination. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          Late complaint, of course, necessarily has some potential disadvantages to the accused because it reduces his opportunity to explore the matters complained of in some ways or it has that potential. First of all, of course, memory of events tends to decrease and become vaguer. However, in this case, the accused says it did not happen. Not only did it not happen, there was never an opportunity for it to happen, never an occasion when it could have happened, never an occasion when there could have been a misunderstanding about what was happening. It is quite clear that the accused says there is no occasion of this nature or occasion when it might have been misunderstood. Two things arise, of course, when there is a delay in complaint. One is the opportunity of the accused perhaps to look at matters which were happening at about that time and to raise them in evidence. Also, the capacity of the complainants to be accurate is probably reduced and that may raise some greater difficulty in cross-examination of them. It may also, of course, explain some errors in the recollection.’ 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
      33 Counsel for the appellant asked her Honour to give redirections in respect of the passage we have quoted. The submission was that her Honour's directions fell short of what the decision of this Court in Longman v The Queen required. Her Honour acceded to the submission by giving a redirection in these terms: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ‘ 
          Finally, I just want to make it very clear about this, the matters are to be looked at separately 
          . There is no supporting evidence so that the evidence in one cannot be used in another. The evidence of one complainant cannot be used to support the evidence of the other. There was a very long period in which there was no complaint. The complaint came late.  
          You must take that into account 
           and the circumstances in which it came into existence and what the complainant, that is [the relevant complainant] who was the only one who complained of course, had to say about that. There was no complaint as such from [the other complainant]. He told the police about it when he was approached by the police following the complaint by [the relevant complainant]. You will be aware that in the circumstances of a twenty year delay that clearly those are all matters which you are going to consider.  
          You are going to consider motive, the opportunity to concoct, the reason why that might be. You are going to look very carefully at the nature and circumstances in which that complaint came into existence. Those are all matters that you will bear in mind when you consider the case for the accused 
          .’"" 
          
         
        
       
      
    93 Having regard to the terms of that direction, it is apparent that the distinction drawn in the joint judgment was between a formulation of the kind “clearly you have to look carefully at the circumstances” (labelled a “caution” in the joint judgment), and the Longman formulation, “it would be dangerous to convict” (which attracted the label of a “warning”). The subsequent use of the term “caution” to describe something less than a “warning” appears to derive from that passage. It does not follow, however, that the use of the phrase “I caution you” instead of the phrase “I warn you” will necessarily give a direction the characterisation of mere comment, or mean that it does not amount to a warning in substance. 
     
      
    94 Earlier in the joint judgment, their Honours had expressly acknowledged that the distinction drawn in the well-known passage in Longman at 91 is between circumstances which invite “comment” and “those in respect of which a warning is imperative”: at [39].  
     
      
    95 In a separate judgment in Crampton, Kirby J also noted the distinction made by the majority in Longman between comment and a warning. His Honour said at [126]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Comment 
         will simply remind the jury of matters frequently within common experience which they may ordinarily be taken to know but might have forgotten or overlooked.  
        Warnings 
         derive from the special experience of the law. The specific difficulties that an accused will have, in circumstances of significant delay, in defending himself or herself in a criminal trial, include securing evidence (comprising now scientific as well as lay evidence) and gathering information promptly with which to test and challenge the evidence of the accuser.”  
        
       
      
    96 Hayne J, similarly, drew a distinction between judicial comment and warning. His Honour stated at [142]: 
     
      
       
        
        “But what has come to be known as a “ 
        Longman 
         warning” is not just a judicial comment of this kind, proper and appropriate as it may be. It is a warning to the jury that, because the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of so many years, it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinising the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. That warning was not given.”  
        
       
      
    97 The requirements of the Longman direction were next considered by the High Court in Doggett. That case was concerned with a trial in which the trial Judge told the jury that they should scrutinise the complainant’s evidence very carefully, but did not warn the jury of the danger, given the delay between the alleged offences and the complaint, of convicting on the complainant’s evidence. The judgments in Doggett consistently use the term “a Longman warning”, but do not hold that the direction must include the word “warning”.  
     
      
    98 The principles stated by Sully J in BWT were distilled from his Honour’s careful survey of the decisions of the High Court in Longman, Crampton and Doggett. As noted by the Chief Judge in the present case, they include the following proposition at [95] (subparagraph [3]): 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me to be a reasonable inference from what their Honours have said that all the current Justices of the High Court, excepting the Chief Justice and McHugh J, take the basic position that in any criminal trial a feature of which is substantial delay in complaint of alleged sexual offences then charged against the particular accused, a  
        Longman 
         direction  
        must 
         be given. Not only  
        must  
        the direction be given; but it  
        must 
         be cast in a form that manifests, and is seen plainly to manifest, certain characteristics which one can draw, as follows, from the various statements of principle in  
        Longman 
         itself and in the subsequent decisions in  
        Crampton 
         and in  
        Doggett 
        : 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) The direction must be cast in the form of a  
        warning 
        . Any form of expression which is thought to have the character of a  
        comment 
        , or even of a  
        caution 
         will not sufficiently comply with what is required by law. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        It seems to me to follow that any trial Judge who is framing a  
        Longman 
         direction ought to ensure that the direction is framed, in terms, as a  
        warning 
        .” 
        
       
      
    99 I do not read that passage as a statement of principle that a Longman direction must be preceded by the word “warn” or “warning”. Those are not the only words or forms of expression by which the import of a warning is capable of being conveyed.  
     
      
    100 The distinction drawn by Sully J is between a direction framed “in terms” as a warning and a form of expression having the character of a comment or a caution. His Honour’s reference to a form of expression having the character of a “caution” must, in my view, be understood in the context of the terms of the direction given that description in the joint judgment in Crampton.  
     
      
    101 I do not think that the judgment of Sully J in BWT holds that a direction may only be “framed, in terms, as a warning” by use of the word “warn” or “warning”. As noted in the judgment of the Chief Judge, no set form of words is required in order to give an adequate Longman direction, and that has been acknowledged by Sully J himself: see R v Kesisyan [2003] NSWCCA 259 at [20]. His Honour there emphasised (at [21]) that the essential task is to ensure that the substance of what is conveyed accords with the substance of the principles established by the decision in BWT.  
     
      
    102 The essence of the distinction between a direction having the character of comment or a caution and a direction framed as a warning lies in the requirement for a warning to identify and explain the risk or danger inherent in the trial as one the recognition of which derives from the Court’s specialised or accumulated experience, as opposed to merely advising the jury to “take care” or “use caution” in a particular aspect of the case: see for example Longman at 91.2 (joint judgment) and at 95.9 to 96.1 per Deane J; Crampton at [126] per Kirby J; Doggett at [85] per McHugh J.  
     
      
    103 I accept that the principles stated by Sully J in BWT have been applied in a number of decisions of this Court, including those referred to by the Chief Judge. However, none of those cases, in my view, is authority for the proposition that a Longman direction must use the word “warn” or “warning” in order to satisfy the requirement expressed by Sully J that it be “framed, in terms, as a warning”.  
     
      
    104 BWT was first applied in this Court in R v SJB [2002] NSWCCA 163 (it was cited with approval two weeks earlier in R v Channell [2002] NSWCCA 187 but the judgment in that case does not disclose what the deficiency in the impugned direction was). In SJB, the Court’s decision turned on the trial Judge’s failure to incorporate, in his direction, the proposition that it would be “dangerous to convict”: [2002] NSWCCA 163; (2002) A Crim R 572 at [53] per Levine J, Sheller JA and Simpson J agreeing. 
     
      
    105 Similarly, the decision of this Court in R v GEA [2002] NSWCCA 222 turned on the absence of any warning of the relevant danger. The trial Judge had introduced the direction with the words, “There is one other warning I have got to give you…” The Judge proceeded to note the period of delay between the alleged events and the trial and pointed to the forensic difficulties caused by that delay. His Honour told the jury that they should carefully consider those factors when assessing the evidence and the witnesses and the weight to be given to the evidence of the witnesses.  
     
      
    106 In upholding the appeal against conviction, Hidden J said at [10] (Heydon JA and Blanche AJ agreeing): 
     
      
       
        
        “What does concern me, however, is that at no stage did his Honour warn the jury of the danger of convicting arising from the delay and the consequent need for careful scrutiny of the complainant’s evidence. Nor did his Honour refer to the effect upon the reliability of the complainant’s evidence of the delay, having regard to his relative youth.”  
        
       
      
    107 The Court’s approach in that case looked to the sufficiency of the direction according to its substance, notwithstanding the terms in which it had been introduced by the trial Judge; see also DBG [2002] NSWCCA 328 especially at [30] and [39] per Howie J; Meagher JA and Simpson J agreeing. 
     
      
    108 In the decision in WRC (cited by the Chief Judge), Kirby J concluded that the direction given by the trial Judge was “not framed as a warning”: at [146]. Hodgson JA agreed that the directions given were inadequate: at [102]. The relevant direction is set out at [127] of the judgment. The trial Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is also one other matter that I bring to your attention, in which the law requires me to bring to your attention and it is a matter that has been also referred to you by counsel for the accused.” 
        
       
      
    109 The Judge proceeded to tell the jury that because of the delay between the time when the events were alleged to have occurred and the time the allegations were brought to police, “the accused has necessarily had difficulties in meeting those allegations”. His Honour identified some of the forensic difficulties resulting from the delay and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am just drawing your attention to these issues which have arisen in this trial, and the fact that you, the jury, are asked to reflect on and consider findings in relation to disputed issues that deal with matters that are some twenty-two or twenty-three years in the past”.  
        
       
      
    110 The conclusion that those remarks were not framed as a warning was, with respect, plainly correct. 
     
      
    111 Kesisyan was a case in which an appeal against conviction was dismissed without extensive discussion of the particular grounds on which the Longman direction was sought to be impugned. The main judgment was given by Meagher JA, who stated at [8]: 
     
      
       
        
        “No specific words are required in a Longman direction and as long as the essential purpose of the direction is performed, that is all the judge needs to do.” 
        
       
      
    112 Sully J agreed, “in the sense that BWT need not be understood as laying down an exact form of words” but emphasised that it is essential for trial Judges to ensure that the substance of what is conveyed accords with the substance of the principles stated in BWT (at [20] to [21]). 
     
      
    113 R v GS [2003] NSWCCA 73 was a decision of this Court which turned principally on the fact that the Judge had told the jury that they should ask themselves whether the accused had lost a chance of obtaining a fair trial by reason of the delay. The vice of that formulation was compounded when his Honour stated that they should ask themselves whether the accused had been put at a disadvantage by the delay or whether it was “difficult for him now to prove his innocence”: at [8]. 
     
      
    114 Buddin J expressed the view that the warning should not have been formulated as a question for the jury to ask themselves and concluded that the direction represented a departure from the requirements of Longman (at [28], Smart AJ and Santow JA agreeing). 
     
      
    115 The Chief Judge has emphasised the statement of Kirby J in JJB [2006] NSWCCA 126 at [42] that “there must be a warning, not simply a comment or a caution”. I think Kirby J was, however, simply paraphrasing the relevant part of the summary of the principles stated by Sully J in BWT. It was not contended in that case that the direction had not been framed as a warning.  
     
      
    116 WSP [2005] NSWCCA 427 was heard by Spigelman CJ and Sully and RS Hulme JJ. In that case, the trial Judge had identified the gap of 13 years between the alleged offences and the time when the accused was formally charged. The Judge said, “In those circumstances it is most important that I give you these warnings” (at [175]). Her Honour proceeded to emphasise the importance of appreciating the effects of the delay on the ability of the accused to defend himself by testing the evidence. She told the jury that they could only convict the accused if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the truth and reliability of the complainant’s evidence.  
     
      
    117 The Judge did not, however, include a formulation of the kind “it would be dangerous to convict”. Hulme J concluded that, in the circumstances of that case, the jury should have been instructed in that form: at [181]. Hulme J also thought that the warning lacked the strength to conform to the last requirement identified in the summary of principles stated by Sully J in BWT, namely, that “the form of the warning must be such as bears unmistakably the imprint of the court’s own authority”: at [182]-[183].  
     
      
    118 Sully J also concluded that the Longman direction as given was insufficient: at [73]. Spigelman CJ dissented. His Honour stated (at [3]) that the analysis in BWT had not been adopted in other cases, but concluded in any event that the direction under consideration met its requirements, expressing the view that to say the jury “can only convict if” is more forceful than to say it would be “dangerous to convict unless”. His Honour reiterated that it is “wrong to treat any judicial statement, even in a judgment of the High Court, as the equivalent of a statutory formula” (at [13]). The judgment of Sully J included a firm rebuttal (with his Honour’s customary grace) of the proposition that BWT had not been adopted in other cases (at [77] to [92]). 
     
      
    119 DRE [2006] NSWCCA 280 was decided the following year. The direction given by the trial Judge in that case is set out at [110] of the decision. The trial Judge had said to the jury that the accused had lost certain opportunities to challenge the complainant’s evidence. After giving some examples of how these opportunities may have been lost, his Honour continued (my emphasis): 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not think there is any need for me to take you through them  
        in extenso 
        ,  
        but I am required to remind you of these disadvantages 
         which the accused has suffered because of the delay, these lost opportunities and tell you that it would be unsafe to convict in those circumstances where there has been delay, on the unsupported evidence of the complainant … unless you are satisfied, having examined that evidence in detail with particular care and  
        having borne this warning in mind 
        , unless you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was telling you the truth, these things did happen in the way in which he said they happened. So that is delay.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I do not think there is any more in the way of  
        cautions 
         that I am required to — oh, there is one other aspect of delay, I suppose, and that is that if there is a delay between the occurrence of an alleged assault and the reporting of that assault, then that delay is consistent with there not having been an assault to begin with. In other words, if nothing happens, there is nothing to complain about.” 
         
          
        
       
      
    120 The appellant’s arguments on appeal (summarised by Simpson J at [68]) included complaint as to the absence of any express “warning” and the use, instead, of the phrase “but I am required to remind you of these disadvantages”. Complaint was also made as to the use of the word “cautions” which it was contended was inadequate to meet the requirement that a “warning” be given. 
     
      
    121 Spigelman CJ stated (my emphasis): 
     
      
       
        
        “The second matter on which reliance was placed was the proposition that at no stage did his Honour specifically “warn” the jury of the real disadvantages that the accused had suffered by reason of the delay. In this Court, in contrast with the position in Western Australia, a strict approach has been taken to the requirement that  
        what must be conveyed to the jury is a “warning” in terms 
        . (See  
        R v BWT 
          
        at [95]. The other case law is referred to in  
        R v WSP 
         [2005] NSWCCA 427 at [3] and [77]-[85]).” 
        
       
      
    122 His Honour’s statement that what must be conveyed is a “warning” in terms suggests acceptance of the proposition that the word “warning” must be used. I note that, in BWT, Sully J had not used inverted commas around the word “warning”. His Honour said that the trial Judge ought to ensure that the direction is framed, in terms, as a warning.  
     
      
    123 I accept that Spigelman CJ appears (at [18] to [22] of the judgment) to assume as a premise that the decision in BWT does require the trial Judge to use the word “warning” in a Longman direction. Whether his Honour accepted that premise is less clear (particularly having regard to his dissenting judgment in WSP). The relevant remarks in DRE were made in the context that his Honour would have refused leave to argue the point under rule 4, and would in any event have rejected it because the trial Judge had used the word “warning”, albeit not at the outset of the direction. 
     
      
    124 More significantly, however, his Honour then stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Shortly after  
        BWT 
        , in  
        R v Kesisyan 
         [2003] NSWCCA 259, this Court, with the express agreement of Sully J, held that no specific words are required in a  
        Longman 
         warning. (See at [8], [20]–[21], [23].) 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The issue in this case is similar to that which arose in  
        WSP 
         supra. The basic structure of the  
        Longman 
         warning is “dangerous to convict unless …”. In  
        WSP 
         the trial judge had used the formulation “you could only convict the accused if …”. I was of the opinion that the requirements of the  
        Longman 
         warning were satisfied. However, I was in dissent on this matter.” 
        
       
       
      
    125 Simpson J expressly rejected the complaint about the force of the word “remind” in place of “warn” and the word “cautions” in place of “warnings” (at [76]-[77] and [80]). Her Honour concluded that the direction adequately brought home to the jury the disadvantages suffered by the appellant by reason of the delay in the bringing of the allegations (at [81]). Adams J dissented, finding that the direction given was inadequate.  
     
      
    126 I find it difficult to accept, from my survey of the relevant authorities, that although no specific words are otherwise required in a Longman direction, it must nonetheless include the word “warning”. I have reached the conclusion that the use of the word “warning” is neither necessary nor always sufficient to satisfy the requirement stated in BWT at [95] that a Longman direction be framed “in terms” as a warning.  
     
      
    127 I do not think my conclusion on that issue ignores the rebuke in Farah Constructions at [134] referred to by the Chief Judge. For my part, I doubt whether McHugh J in Dyers at [47] is to be taken as having impliedly endorsed what Sully J said at [95] in BWT (but cf WSP at [92]). In any event, I do not disregard the dicta of Kirby J in Dyers at [55]. In accordance with those views, I accept the correctness of the analysis of Sully J in BWT as a premise of the conclusion I have reached. Where my view differs from that of the Chief Judge is that I do not regard BWT as authority for the proposition that the word “warning” or “warn” must be used to satisfy the requirements of Longman.  
     
      
    128 For my part, I see no difference in the force of the phrase “I therefore caution you that it may be wrong for you to convict” and the phrase “I therefore warn you that it would be dangerous for you to convict”. Both, in my view, are sufficient to satisfy the requirement for the direction to be cast in the form of an authoritative judicial warning of the dangers inherent in the trial. 
     
      
    129 The second issue raised by the Chief Judge is whether the use of the word “may” in the phrase “it may be wrong” and the words “well satisfied” reduced the force of the direction. The concern expressed by the Chief Judge is that the terms of that direction were not correct, the true legal position being that it was not open to the jury to convict unless satisfied of the complainant’s evidence to the relevant standard.  
     
      
    130 I do not think either jury can have been under any misapprehension in that respect. Each jury had been told repeatedly of the relevant standard. Specifically, they had been told that, in relation to the charges in the cases before them, the “practical reality” was that they would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each complainant was being truthful in relation to the critical matters about which she gave evidence (30 August 2007 at T7-8; 7 September 2007 at T6). 
     
      
    131 The impugned passage of the Judge’s directions would not, in my view, have been understood to derogate from that constraint. The complete phrase used by the Judge was “[b]ecause of the delay in the accused learning of these allegations, he has been prejudiced in the conduct of his defence. I therefore caution you that it may be wrong for you to convict on the complainant’s evidence unless, after scrutinising her evidence very carefully indeed, you are well satisfied that her evidence was both truthful and accurate”. Indeed, the term “well satisfied” was stronger than the words “were satisfied” used in the judgment in Longman itself. 
     
      
    132 I think the jury would have understood that part of her Honour’s direction, not as a qualification to the directions earlier given, but as an explanation of risk that flowed from the forensic disadvantage that her Honour identified. The direction was apt to convey that, unless they scrutinised the complainant’s evidence “very carefully indeed”, a conviction may be wrong. That was an accurate description of the relevant risk. The reason it is dangerous to convict without heeding the warning contained in the Longman direction is that the conviction may be wrong. In my view, the words used in the Judge’s direction warned the jury of the existence of the relevant risk so as to meet the potential miscarriage of justice which prompts the requirement for a Longman direction.  
     
      
    133 In my view, the appeal should be dismissed.

      On 23 October 2008 the appellant was charged with possession of precursor drugs for the manufacture or production of prohibited drugs under the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
       1985. The appellant had been under electronic and physical surveillance and was observed passing containers, allegedly containing Sassafras Oil (the precursor drug) to another party. A search of the appellant’s home the next day uncovered approximately $100 000 in cash. 
       
       
      On 24 October 2008 Justice Hislop issued an order pursuant to s 10 of the  
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act 
       1990 restraining the appellant from dealing with his property. An Order under s 10 must be made where an application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating, relevantly, that the officer has a suspicion that the person has engaged in a serious crime related activity and the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for that suspicion. In this case, the affidavit deposed a suspicion on the basis of a police Facts Sheet and a search of the records of the NSW COPS system. 
       
       
      The issues before this Court were whether his Honour failed to give reasons and whether his Honour erred in finding that there were reasonable grounds for the suspicion. 
       
       
      A constitutional challenge to the legislation was abandoned in light of a presently reserved High Court decision.

      Extension of Time 
       
       
      1 An extension of time to lodge the appeal should be granted, as there is no suggestion of prejudice. The effect of the freezing of all the appellant’s funds is an impediment to obtaining legal advice, the delay was short, and this appeal is the appellant’s only recourse against the Order.

      The duty to give reasons 
       
       
      2 A person subject to the consequences of an Order is entitled to know more than that the judge “had regard to” the affidavit. The necessity to give reasons is such that the Court should be slow to exercise its discretion to refuse leave on the basis of a perception that the same order will be made on remitter, particularly when the original proceedings were ex parte.

      Reasonable grounds for suspicion 
       
       
      3 Section 10 requires that the deponent of an affidavit hold the relevant suspicion or belief. Section 75 of the  
      Evidence Act 
       1995 requires a deponent of an affidavit to give evidence as to the source, of relevantly, their suspicion. Here, there was no reference to persons who witnessed the relevant acts or who could attest to the relevant facts. In particular, there was no stated basis upon which the relevant substance had been identified as a precursor drug. [36]-[37] [39] [45]-[47] [49] [52] [53] 
       
       
      4 The fact that a person has been charged by a police officer is not sufficient, in and of itself, to ground a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in a serious crime related activity. Reliance on an opinion held by a police officer that an offence had been committed does not identify any fact or matter relating to such conduct. [34]-[36] [52] [53] 
       
       
        
        International Finance Trust Company Ltd v New South Wales Crime Commission

      5 The suspicion as to intent to manufacture was reasonable having regard to the background facts such as the large quantity of oil involved, the covert nature of the transaction and the quantity of cash found at the appellant’s premises. [41]-[42] [52] [53]

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This an application for leave to appeal, heard together with the appeal, with respect to orders made by Hislop J on 24 October 2008. Those orders were made pursuant to s 10 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (“the Act”) restraining the appellant from dealing with his property, including identified property set out in schedules to the orders.  
     
      
    2 Section 10 relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “10(1) A restraining order is an order that no person is to dispose of or attempt to dispose of, or to otherwise deal with or attempt to otherwise deal with, an interest in property to which the order applies except in such manner or in such circumstances (if any) as are specified in the order. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court, ex parte, for a restraining order in respect of:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) specified interests, a specified class of interests or all the interests, in property of a person suspected of having engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities, including interests acquired after the making of the order and before the making of an assets forfeiture order affecting the interests that are subject to the restraining order, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The Supreme Court must make the order applied for under subsection (2) if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) in the case of an application in respect of an interest referred to in subsection (2) (a)—the authorised officer suspects that the person has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        and the Court considers that having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.” 
        
       
      
    3 A number of matters were raised in the draft Notice of Appeal and in written submissions. The appellant abandoned a constitutional challenge to the legislation, upon which the High Court is presently reserved on appeal from the judgment of this Court in International Finance Trust Company Limited v New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] NSWCA 291; (2008) 251 ALR 479 (“the IFTC case”). As the oral submissions developed there were two issues which remained to be determined on the appeal. First, the appellant contends that his Honour erred in failing to give reasons. Secondly, the appellant contends that his Honour erred in finding that there were reasonable grounds for the suspicion to which a relevant officer had testified in an affidavit filed in the proceedings. 
     
      
       
      Extension of Time 
       
      
    4 The appellant originally filed a Notice of Appeal on 22 December 2008, together with a Notice of Motion seeking an extension of time to lodge an appeal. As the order of Hislop J was interlocutory, leave to appeal was required. On 23 February 2009 the Registrar of the Court of Appeal made orders that the original proceedings be withdrawn and the present summons seeking leave be filed. An extension of time to file the summons is sought. An explanation for the delay between 21 November and 22 December has been proffered, most relevantly due to an inability to obtain legal advice because all of his assets had been frozen by the orders. The respondent opposes the extension but does not suggest any prejudice. 
     
      
    5 As Giles JA said in Hadjigeorgiou v New South Wales Crime Commission [2007] NSWCA 197; (2007) 174 A Crim R 124: 
     
      
       
        
        “[4] I … do not think that the failure to make a timely application for leave to appeal was satisfactorily explained. Settlement discussions do not obviate the need to comply with the Rules prescribing the time within which an application for leave to appeal must be made. It appears that the claimant preferred absence overseas to attention to his interests in the proceedings, and there was at best leisurely attention to setting aside the orders prior to April 2007. However, the opponent did not assert prejudice, and the orders are a significant interference with the claimant’s rights. In the circumstances, I do not think he should be shut out from his application and am prepared to extend time.” 
        
       
      
    6 The orders were made ex parte. On the unchallenged evidence, they had the effect of freezing all the applicant’s funds. It is understandable that that fact alone would impede a person from obtaining legal advice. The delay was short. The applicant’s only recourse on an ex parte application is to this Court. Time should be extended. The legitimate interest of the prosecution can be accommodated by a short stay to permit a further application to be made. 
     
      
       
      The Duty to Give Reasons 
       
      
    7 At the time that Justice Hislop made the orders, the practice in the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court, being a practice that had existed for many years, perhaps twenty, was that an order would be made without a statement of reasons. This Court has subsequently determined that that practice was wrong in the IFTC case. The respondent contended that leave to appeal should not be granted in this respect. 
     
      
    8 Mr I Temby QC, who appeared with Mr P Singleton for the respondent, advanced four reasons for refusing leave. 
     
      
    9 Mr Temby drew attention to the contents of the “order” made by Hislop J on 24 October 2008. Perhaps, unusually, the paragraphs containing the actual orders made by the Court were introduced by the following words: 
     
      
       
        
        “Considering that, having had regard to the matters contained in the affidavit of Jonathon Lee Spark on 24 October 2008, there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion therein.” 
        
       
      
    10 Mr Temby did not submit that this reference satisfied the requirement for reasons, determined to be required by this Court in the IFTC case. He did, however, note that this sentence incorporated by reference the contents of the affidavit upon which the respondent relied before Justice Hislop, and continues to rely in this Court. The statement “there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion therein”, although more conclusory in its form than a statement of reasons, nevertheless indicates that his Honour had directed his attention to the relevant matters. 
     
      
    11 There is some force in this submission. Reasons in a case of this character do not have to be elaborate. However, the formulation “having had regard to” does not indicate any reasons. 
     
      
    12 Secondly, the respondent noted that the application for leave was out of time. That is the case, but it was only some three weeks out of time. For the reasons given above, time should be extended. 
     
      
    13 The third reason that the respondent submitted was a basis for refusing leave was that the substantive matters of principle had been determined by this Court in the IFTC case. As will appear below, in my opinion, there are additional issues raised by this case. In any event, reasons are an important part of the administration of justice applicable to each case, not only to cases which raise issues of principle. 
     
      
    14 Finally, the respondent submitted that the application had poor prospects of success. This latter submission depended on the outcome of the submissions with respect to the reasonable grounds point, which I would uphold. 
     
      
    15 In my opinion, the reasons advanced by the majority of this Court in the IFTC case for the necessity to give reasons are such that the Court should be slow to exercise its discretion to refuse leave, on the basis of a perception that the same order will be made on remitter. That is particularly so where the original proceedings were ex parte. 
     
      
    16 As Allsop P, with whom Beazley JA agreed, said in the IFTC case: 
     
      
       
        
        “[41] … the subject matter of the Act, the nature of the application, including its judicial character, the consequences to the person of a successful ex parte application to the Commission, lack of an inter-partes interlocutory hearing, the existence of the supervisory appeal and the character of the assessment to be made by the Judge all point to, or are consistent with, the obligation by the Court to provide reasons.” 
        
       
      
    17 As his Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “[46] Here, the Act deals with the restraint and later forfeiture of the property of individuals. The operation of the Act is of the utmost gravity. The power being exercised is judicial. It is not the approval of a search warrant or a listening device; it is the making of an order, in the absence of the relevant party, for the freezing of property for, potentially, a significant period of time. There is no review at first instance … only an appeal. Confidence in the judicial system and ensuring that justice is seen to be done between State and subject require in my view an explanation of the exercise of such a drastic power. That explanation is the giving of reasons.” 
        
       
      
    18 I adopt these reasons and, accordingly, believe that this is an appropriate case for the grant of leave. A person subject to such drastic consequences is entitled to know more than that the judge has “had regard to” an affidavit.  
     
      
    19 I would have been of that opinion even if the substantive issues raised by the appellant on its second basis for appeal were less convincing than is the case, as will appear below. Suffice it to say that the force that I see in the second ground of appeal is such that the grant of leave follows as a matter of course. 
     
      
    20 I note that the respondent could have listed the matter before Hislop J for his Honour to provide reasons. Indeed, his Honour did just that on the application of the Commission in another case which he had also decided before judgment in the IFTC case. (See New South Wales Commission v Beneficial Owners of Various Bank and Share Trading Accounts [2009] NSWSC 322.) The Commission has not done that here and, in my opinion, that reinforces the case for a grant of leave in a situation when the applicant has no other recourse. (See New South Wales Crime Commission v Ollis [2006] NSWCA 76; (2006) 65 NSWLR 478 at [34].) 
     
      
    21 This ground of appeal should be upheld. 
     
      
       
      The Evidence 
       
      
    22 The affidavit in support of the application before Hislop J was sworn by Mr Jonathan Spark, who is the Assistant Director of Financial Investigations at the New South Wales Crime Commission. He deposed to the fact that he had a suspicion that the applicant “has engaged in serious crime related activity”.  
     
      
    23 Section 6(1) of the Act identifies “serious crime related activity” in terms of conduct constituting a “serious criminal offence”, which is further defined in s 6(2)(b) to encompass a “drug trafficking offence”. For present purposes, by s 6(3)(b1), a drug trafficking offence is an offence under specific provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 including under s 24A of that Act, ‘possession of precursors for manufacture or production of prohibited drugs’. It is relevant to note that mere supply is not included in the offence presently under consideration. 
     
      
    24 Mr Spark stated that his suspicion was determined as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “3 The suspicion … is held by me having had regard to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the contents of a 3 page Facts Sheet dated 23 October 2008 prepared by Detective Maree Kiem of the New South Wales Police Force and forwarded to the Commission, a copy of which is annexed hereto and marked ‘A’ (‘the Facts Sheet’); and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a search of the records of the New South Wales COPS system which revealed that on 23 October 2008 Elfar was charged with the offence described in the Facts Sheet.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    25 It is this paragraph upon which the respondent relies as satisfying the requirements of s 10(3) of the Act. 
     
      
    26 The annexed Facts Sheet identified the author as Detective Maree Kiem, who was one of two arresting officers. She was also the informant on the charge. She was identified as an officer in the Drug Squad. The Facts Sheet referred to investigations under the name of Strike Force Guardian, which “utilised various electronic and physical surveillance techniques”. No reference is made to the product of any electronic surveillance. However, physical surveillance of the appellant revealed that on 22 October 2008 he drove a car on the Hume Highway and met a co-accused, Mr Balog, at a service station. The Facts Sheet stated “a number of police monitored the meeting between the accused and Mark Balog”. 
     
      
    27 The monitoring revealed that the accused and Balog removed four large plastic containers from the rear of the accused’s vehicle and placed them in the vehicle driven by Balog. Balog was subsequently stopped and an inspection of the plastic containers revealed that “each of these containers  
     
      
      had a 10 litre capacity and were filled with a yellow coloured oil type liquid”.  
       
      
    28 On the next day a search was executed at the home of the appellant, where he was arrested. Approximately $100,000 in cash was discovered during that search. 
     
      
    29 The Facts Sheet contained the following statement, which appears in the context of the meeting between the appellant and Balog: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was believed that the accused was to supply a large quantity of prohibited drug or drug precursor.” 
        
       
      
    30 Furthermore, the concluding paragraph of the Facts Sheet stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is believed that approximately forty (40) litres of Sassafras Oil is contained within the four plastic drums. If this was manufactured into MDMA it could result in excess of 100,000 MDMA pills being produced with a street value of over three million dollars ($3,000,000).” 
        
       
      
    31 It was common ground that Sassafras Oil is identified as a precursor drug in Schedule 1 to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Regulations 2006. 
     
      
       
      The Ground for Suspicion Issue 
       
      
    32 On the issue of whether there are “reasonable grounds” for the suspicion expressed by Mr Spark, it is significant that no person is identified as having provided any information that is contained in the Facts Sheet. Nor does Mr Spark express any belief in the contents of the Facts Sheet. 
     
      
    33 Mr Temby submitted that the very fact that a person had been charged with an offence by a police officer is sufficient, in and of itself, to indicate that there was a reasonable basis for the belief.  
     
      
    34 In my opinion, this submission should be rejected. Allsop P also rejected this proposition in the IFTC case, at [38], whilst acknowledging that the point was not fully argued in that case. Accordingly, it is necessary for this Court to decide the issue rather than to simply apply Allsop P’s conclusion. 
     
      
    35 The mere fact that a charge has been laid by a police officer is not sufficient, in and of itself, to establish that there were reasonable grounds for the suspicion of the deponent of an affidavit in support of a restraining order. It is no more than evidence that some other person had such a suspicion or belief. 
     
      
    36 What is required by s 10(3) on the part of the deponent is an affidavit stating, relevantly, “the grounds on which” the suspicion that a “person has engaged in serious crime related activity … is based”. The word “grounds” suggests that the requisite facts and matters must relate to the conduct which constitutes the serious criminal offence. Reliance on a belief or opinion held by a police officer that an offence had been committed does not identify any fact or matter relating to such conduct. 
     
      
    37 Of particular significance for present purposes is the absence of any reference in the Facts Sheet to the identity of any person who witnessed any of the relevant events or could attest to any of the relevant facts. Specifically, the use of the passive voice in the two phrases “it was believed that the accused was to supply a large quantity of … drug precursor” and “it is believed that approximately 40 litres of Sassafras Oil is contained within the four plastic drums” renders them far removed from any statement of fact of an element of the offence, namely that there was in fact a precursor drug. There is no reference of any character to the basis upon which any person formed the belief that what was in fact transferred and transported was a precursor drug. 
     
      
    38 Mr Temby pointed out that the author of the Facts Sheet was a member of the Drug Squad. However, this is of little assistance as that officer does not state that she had any relevant belief. Nor does she identify any pertinent fact, other than that the liquid was yellow and oily. 
     
      
    39 In my opinion, the absence of any stated basis upon which the relevant substance could be identified as a precursor drug is such that the Court should not have found that there were reasonable grounds for believing that a serious criminal offence had been committed. 
     
      
    40 Mr T Rickard, who appeared for the appellant, also submitted that there was an absence of any proper basis for reasonable grounds for suspicion that other critical elements of the offence could be established. He referred particularly to the proof that the applicant intended to be involved in manufacture, which was an essential element for the manufacturing offence under s 24A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Section 24A extends to manufacture by another person, ie, the appellant did not have to intend to do the manufacturing himself, but there must be an intent to manufacture. Mr Rickard emphasised that mere supply of a precursor drug was not a serious criminal offence for purposes of the application before the Court.  
     
      
    41 In this regard, Mr Temby pointed to a number of background facts. He placed particular reliance on the very large quantity of the oil involved. A supply of this size, he submitted, was clearly likely to be used for the manufacture of a drug. He reinforced this inference by reference to the covert nature of the transaction and the fact that, on the next day, approximately $100,000 in cash was found at the appellant’s premises. 
     
      
    42 In my opinion, on this matter, the respondent’s submissions should be accepted. There was a proper basis for a suspicion that the intent to manufacture limb of the offence could be satisfied. 
     
      
    43 However, in my opinion, there was no admissible evidence with respect to the critical matter of the identification of the oil. 
     
      
    44 It is sufficient for present purposes to concentrate on the statement in the Facts Sheet that: “It is believed that approximately forty (40) litres of Sassafras Oil is contained within the four plastic drums”. This is critical because without this identification the alleged offences would not constitute “serious criminal activity”. 
     
      
    45 The reference “it is believed” indicates that, at best, this evidence is hearsay. 
     
      
    46 Section 75 of the Evidence Act 1995, identified as the basis for admission of the Facts Sheet in the IFTC case at [15], requires a deponent of an affidavit to give evidence of the “source” of, relevantly, his or her suspicion. 
     
      
    47 In the present case that evidence is in the form of a Facts Sheet which was the only stated source of the suspicion with respect to the identification of the “yellow coloured oil type liquid” as Sassafras Oil. That Sheet does not state any basis for that identification. 
     
      
    48 The issue is whether his Honour erred in determining that there were reasonable grounds for suspicion. In a judgment to be handed down simultaneously with this judgment (New South Wales Crime Commission v Vu [2009] NSWCA 349), this Court has determined that an appeal from an s 10 order is to be determined in accordance with the principles in Warren Coombes (1979) 142 CLR 531. The absence of reasons becomes particularly pertinent. As the authorities have frequently emphasised, one of the purposes served by reasons is informing the appellate process. (See Soulemezis v Dudley Holdings Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 280.) All this Court has before it is the statement that his Honour “had regard to the affidavit”. This Court is not aware of what, if any, consideration his Honour gave to the deficiency in the identification of the Oil. 
     
      
    49 On the above analysis, some basis in fact was required to identify the oil as Sassafras Oil. Absent any such basis there was no evidence of “the existence of facts which are sufficient to induce … in a reasonable person” a suspicion that the appellant has engaged in serious crime related activity within s 10(3) of the Act. (George v Rockett (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 112.) 
     
      
    50 This ground of appeal should be upheld.

    JUDGMENT1. Mr Watts who appears for the accused has asked me to discharge the jury. His application is based on a question and answer given yesterday. Yesterday the Crown Prosecutor asked the witness Ms Singh this question: 
     
      
      “Q. The charge that you pleaded guilty to was a charge that on 19 April 2008 at Lakemba and other places in the State of New South Wales while in company with David Hoey and Christos Podaras did take [the complainant] without his consent with intent to obtain advantage, namely, to facilitate an assault upon [the complainant] and at the time actual bodily harm was occasioned to [the complainant], was it words similar to that was the charge you pleaded guilty to? 
       
      A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    2. That question and answer were followed by evidence about the witness giving an undertaking to give evidence against Mr Podaras in these proceedings. There was also evidence about her being sentenced by another judge of this court and receiving a discount of some forty per cent from her sentence as a result of her assistance in giving evidence against Mr Podaras. 3. The witness Singh was charged with the charge read out by the Crown Prosecutor which is the same charge, or one very similar to the charge, being faced by Mr Podaras in these proceedings and to which he has pleaded not guilty. The charge against Ms Singh arose out of the same incident as the charge which this jury is trying. 4. Mr Watts argues that the fact that the Crown Prosecutor included the name of his client in the charge read out to Ms Singh and upon which the judge acted in giving her a discount, must irremediably prejudice his client in this case. He argues that the inclusion of this client’s name will lead the jury to infer that the judge accepted that his client was involved, and based upon that acceptance made the significant determination of reducing Ms Singh’s sentence. He said that the better way of putting the question would have been to refer to Ms Singh being charged “with others”. 5. I should add that Mr Watts did not object to the question at the time but acknowledged that he had not anticipated the question being in such terms. 6. Mr Watts acknowledges that in cross-examining Ms Singh he will canvas with her that she is giving evidence against his client as a result of the undertaking and that she received a discount from the judge as a result of that undertaking. 7. The focus of the prejudice asserted by Mr Watts is therefore on the inclusion of his client’s name in the charge read out to Ms Singh, to which she pleaded guilty and upon which the judge acted. 8. In my opinion that is not a circumstance which warrants the discharge of the jury. It may be that some members of the jury pursue a line of thinking which Mr Watts has suggested - that there is some formal connection between the charge and the judge acting. In my opinion that problem can be remedied by a less extreme measure, namely a direction to the jury. 9. Ms Herbert as Crown Prosecutor has made available a proposed direction, which I will have marked for identification 6. I propose to give a direction which includes some aspects of her proposal but will include aspects of further directions suggested by Mr Watts as an alternative to his discharge application. 10. I therefore reject his application.

     LEE v DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (CTH) 
     
     
      
     
     
     Headnote 
     
     
      
    On 30 July 2007 the respondent (""the Director"") sought three orders in the Common Law Division concerning certain property connected to the applicant pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth). The first order was to restrain disposal of the property, the second was for an examination of the applicant about his affairs, and the third was for forfeiture of the property to the Commonwealth. A restraining order may be made under s 19 on the basis of a reasonable suspicion that the property is the proceeds of an indictable offence. An examination order can be made under s 180, the privilege against self-incrimination existing only partially during such an examination. A forfeiture order must be made under s 49 in circumstances where a restraining order has been in force for six months, and the applicant has made no application for an exclusion order under s 29. An application for an exclusion order cannot be heard unless the Director has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct an examination of the applicant.Only the restraining order was made. On 4 September 2007 the applicant sought a number of orders, one of which being that the orders for examination and forfeiture be stayed on the basis that either the making of the examination order, or the need to resist the forfeiture order, would force him to waive his right to silence and thus risk incriminating himself. On 20 March 2009 Hidden J refused the application for a stay. The applicant sought leave to appeal to this Court.The issues for determination on appeal were:(i) the consequence upon the privilege against self-incrimination of the procedure contained in the Proceeds of Crime Act for the recovery of proceeds of suspected crime;(ii) whether such consequence justified a stay of the proceedings in relation to the examination order, and(iii) whether such consequence justified a stay of the proceedings in relation to the forfeiture order. The Court held, dismissing the appeal:In relation to (i)1. The privilege constitutes an aspect of a fundamental right, not merely a testimonial privilege, and engages the power in the Court to order a stay for its protection in appropriate circumstances: [38], [41]–[42].

      [2003] QSC 436, referred to.  
      
    2. The Proceeds of Crime Act manifests a plain and clear intention to effect the confiscation of property in the circumstances which it prescribes, regardless of the interests of any person in the property: [21].

    In relation to (ii)3. A stay of the proceedings in relation to an examination order is inappropriate in circumstances where neither a Court has exercised the discretion to permit the examination, nor an approved examiner has exercised the discretion to give the applicant, once the subject of an examination order, notice of an examination: [49]. In relation to (iii)4. The considerations militating against a stay of the proceedings in relation to the examination order also militate against a stay of the proceedings in relation to the forfeiture order due to an inability of the applicant to resist the order by any means other than an application for an exclusion order: [52]

       [2004] ACTSC 101; 185 FLR 399; 150 A Crim R 163, considered.  
      
    5. A stay of the proceedings in relation to the forfeiture order would have the practical effect of putting the Director to an election between either instituting criminal proceedings or disclaiming an entitlement to institute proceedings in the future. It is clear that the Proceeds of Crime Act was not intended to produce such a result: [58].

     LEE v DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (CTH) 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JUDGMENT of THE COURT delivered by BASTEN JA: On 30 July 2007 the respondent (“the Director”) sought and obtained an order in the Common Law Division restraining disposal of certain property, pursuant to s 19 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth). The property consisted of funds held in each of seven bank accounts, five of which were in the name of Mr Kee Sien Lee (“the applicant”) and two of which were in company names. 
     
      
    2 The summons also sought an order that the applicant be examined about his affairs (including the nature and location of any property), pursuant to s 180 of the Proceeds of Crime Act. Thirdly, the summons sought an order that the property specified in the schedule be forfeited to the Commonwealth, pursuant to s 49. 
     
      
    3 On 4 September 2007 the applicant filed a notice of motion seeking to strike out orders 2 and 3 sought in the summons, namely the order that he be examined and the order for forfeiture. The notice of motion also sought a declaration that the restraining order had ceased to be in force pursuant to s 45(2) of the Proceeds of Crime Act. The motion came before Hidden J in the Common Law Division who, on 7 April 2008, refused the orders and declarations referred to above: Lee v DPP (Cth) [2008] NSWSC 300. No appeal has been brought from those decisions. 
     
      
    4 The applicant’s notice of motion sought two further orders. The first was that the restraining order be revoked, pursuant to s 42 of the Proceeds of Crime Act. The second was that the orders for examination and forfeiture (and a claim for costs) be “stayed”. Because the orders had not been made, they could not in terms be stayed, but it appears to have been assumed that this form of relief constituted an application for a stay of the determination of the summons, to the extent that it sought relief other than the restraining order. 
     
      
    5 So far, it appears that the revocation of the restraining order pursuant to s 42 has not been pursued. Rather, the applicant sought to pursue the order for a stay, which was refused by Hidden J on 20 March 2009: Lee v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2009] NSWSC 174. It is from that judgment that the present application for leave to appeal is brought. 
     
      
    6 As will be explained below, the application raises, first, important questions with respect to the proper construction and operation of the Proceeds of Crime Act. Secondly, the primary judge adopted an approach which, the applicant contended, was inconsistent with that adopted by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Jo [2007] QCA 251; 176 A Crim R 17 (McMurdo P, Wilson and Lyons JJ). If it were held that the application of Jo would produce a different result, the Director invited this Court not to follow Jo. Any proceeding under the Proceeds of Crime Act will be an exercise of federal jurisdiction, whether in this Court or in another State Supreme Court. Accordingly, this Court should not decline to follow principles established by another intermediate appeal court under the same Act unless persuaded that the decision was distinguishable or plainly wrong: cf Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd [1993] HCA 15; 177 CLR 485 at 492.  
     
      
    7 Thirdly, the applicant invited this Court to review the approach taken in exercising the discretion to stay proceedings which may give rise to a real risk of disclosure of incriminating material, pending determination of related criminal proceedings, being principles commonly sourced to the judgment of Wootten J in McMahon v Gould (1982) 7 ACLR 202. The approach adopted in that case was said to be inconsistent with subsequent statements of principle by the High Court in, for example, Reid v Howard [1995] HCA 40; 184 CLR 1.  
     
      
    8 The issues raised are significant and warrant a grant of leave to appeal. 
     
      
    Issues raised on appeal9 The legislation under which the Director proceeded permits an application for a restraining order in respect of identified property where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is the proceeds of an indictable offence and the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating the officer’s suspicion to that effect: Proceeds of Crime Act, s 19. If those conditions are satisfied, the order must be made. Once a restraining order has been in force for six months, a forfeiture order is liable to follow, virtually as of course, unless the person interested in the property has sought to have the property excluded from the restraining order: s 49(1)(c) and (3). Before such an application can be entertained, the Director must have had an opportunity to examine him, pursuant to an order under s 180. 
     
      
    10 Although there is no requirement under s 19 that any person be convicted or even charged with a criminal offence in respect of the property, nevertheless, where the suspicion is that the property is the proceeds of an offence in which the interested person may have been involved, he or she may, in a practical sense, be placed by the statutory scheme in the position of either having to waive the right to silence in relation to the means by which the property was acquired, or to allow the forfeiture order to be made. Before the primary judge, the applicant argued that the stay should operate until he was either –  
     
      
       
      (a) informed that he will not be charged with any offence to which the restraining order relates; or 
       
       
      (b) advised that he will be charged with one or more offences to which the restraining order relates, and the precise nature of any such charge or charges. 
       
      
    11 The Director concedes that he is not presently in a position to charge the applicant; he also contends that he cannot be required to give an undertaking not to press charges in the future. Accordingly a stay would, in his submission, thwart the intended purpose of the Act, which is to allow forfeiture of the proceeds of crimes, even where there is no more than a reasonably grounded suspicion relating to the property. 
     
      
    12 In one sense, the issue thus raised is whether the applicant was required by the legislation either to forego his right against self-incrimination or his interest in the property. The dilemma was arguably accentuated by the fact that his proposed inquisitor in an examination under s 180, would act on the initiative of his potential prosecutor, namely the Director. 
     
      
    13 Whether or not the applicant is placed on the horns of such a dilemma and whether or not the stay which he now seeks is the appropriate remedy, are the issues to be determined. They are to be addressed in the first place not by reference to authority, but rather by reference to the text and purpose of the statute. 
     
      
    Statutory scheme: Proceeds of Crime Act(a) general principles14 As noted by McPherson JA in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Hart (No 2) [2005] QCA 51; [2005] 2 Qd R 246 at [16], in relation to the Proceeds of Crime Act: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is a lengthy history of the use of legislative provisions like these as adjuncts to enforcing customs and excise duties, trade and navigation laws, anti-slave trading measures, and other activities prohibited by Parliament. Courts of Admiralty and Exchequer developed special procedures  
        in rem 
         against forfeited goods to give effect to such legislation, which in modern times have been held to be still available to common law courts in the United States: see discussion in  
        CJ Hendry Co v Moore 
         (1943) 318 US 133 and cf  
        Willey v Synan  
        (1935) 54 CLR 175, 185-186.” 
        
       
      
    15 In Burton v Honan [1952] HCA 30; 86 CLR 169 an issue was raised as to the constitutional validity of such provisions in the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). Noting that reliance had been placed on the incidental power, Dixon CJ, at 178, acknowledged the potential for injustice to innocent individuals if their property were forfeit. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the other side it is pointed out that in the history of English and Australian Customs legislation forfeiture provisions are common, drastic and far reaching, and that they have been considered a necessary measure to vindicate the right of the Crown and to ensure the strict and complete observance of the Customs laws, which are notoriously difficult of complete enforcement in the absence of strong provisions supporting their administration.” 
        
       
      
    16 Modern legislation permitting the confiscation by the state of proceeds of crime has a history of some two decades in this country: see Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth), Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989 (NSW) and Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Act 1990 (NSW). In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Saxon (1990) 28 NSWLR 263 at 264 Kirby P noted that there was similar legislation in the UK, namely the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 (UK) and that a common progenitor appeared to be the forfeiture statute enacted in the USA in 1982. The present Act identifies as one of its principal objects giving effect to Australia’s obligations under the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime (Strasbourg, 1990) to which Australia is a signatory: Proceeds of Crime Act, s 5(f). 
     
      
    17 An important aspect of such legislation, in which respect the Proceeds of Crime Act is not unique, is to provide for the confiscation of the proceeds of suspected crime, in the absence of criminal proceedings or conviction. Proceedings “on an application for a restraining order or a confiscation order are not criminal proceedings”: s 315(1). Further, except in relation to offences under the Act, “the rules of construction applicable only in relation to the criminal law do not apply in the interpretation of this Act”: s 315(2). To the extent that principles of construction relating to penal provisions have been applied in construing the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) that course is not available with respect to the Proceeds of Crime Act: cf New South Wales Crime Commission v Kelaita [2008] NSWCA 284 at [16] (Allsop P, Giles and Bell JJA agreeing). However, the constraint is of limited significance. As explained by Gibbs J in Beckwith v The Queen [1976] HCA 55; 135 CLR 569 at 576: 
     
      
       
        
        “The rule formerly accepted, that statutes creating offences are to be strictly construed, has lost much of its importance in modern times. In determining the meaning of a penal statute the ordinary rules of construction must be applied, but if the language of the statute remains ambiguous or doubtful the ambiguity or doubt may be resolved in favour of the subject by refusing to extend the category of criminal offences …. The rule is perhaps one of last resort.” 
        
       
      
    18 There is, however, a more general principle of construction that denies a statutory intention to modify or abolish fundamental rights or freedoms absent clear and unambiguous language. That principle does not require express reference to the right or freedom which is diminished, but the intention to modify or abolish must arise by necessary implication from the terms of the statute: see generally Kelaita at [13]-[15]. The high store set by the preservation of such basic rights and freedoms is sometimes declared as requiring an intention to the contrary to be expressed with “irresistible clearness”: see, eg, Studman v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2007] NSWCA 285; 177 A Crim R 34 at [35] (McClellan CJ at CL, Spigelman CJ and Handley AJA agreeing). 
     
      
    19 It is true that such language has a long lineage. It appears to have been adopted in Australia from Maxwell on Statutes (4th ed) by O’Connor J in Potter v Minahan [1908] HCA 63; 7 CLR 277 at 304. However, the statement in Maxwell on Statutes contained a degree of hyperbole which was unnecessary to the determination of that case. In Potter, the construction of the term “immigrant” for which the appellant was contending (“boldly” in O’Connor J’s view) was such as to include any Australian-born permanent resident who was returning to the country after a month in New Zealand: at 303. So far from being irresistibly clear, his Honour remarked that it was “hardly necessary to say that an interpretation which would impute to the legislature an intention to bring about that result stands condemned on the face of it”: at 303-304. More commonly, that which is to be expressed clearly is contrasted with ambiguous statements, as in Coco v The Queen [1994] HCA 15; 179 CLR 427 at 437: 
     
      
       
        
        “General words will rarely be sufficient for that purpose if they do not specifically deal with the question because, in the context in which they appear, they will often be ambiguous on the aspect of interference with fundamental rights.” 
        
       
      
    (b) legislative purposes20 The next step is to identify the broad purpose of the legislation. The Proceeds of Crime Act manifests a plain and clear intention to effect the confiscation of property in the circumstances which it prescribes, regardless of the interests of any person in the property. As a law of the Commonwealth, it constitutes an accepted exception to the requirement that any law of the Parliament providing for the compulsory acquisition of property from a person must provide for compensation on just terms: Constitution, s 51(xxxi); Burton v Honan 86 CLR at 180-181 (Dixon CJ); Re Director of Public Prosecutions; Ex parte Lawler [1994] HCA 10; 179 CLR 270; Mutual Pools & Staff Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1994] HCA 9; 179 CLR 155 at 187-188 (Deane and Gaudron JJ). There was no argument put to the contrary. 
     
      
    21 Thus, the confiscation of property is not achieved by words of general implication, nor is it an intrusion on general law protections which has come about incidentally to the main purpose of the legislation: see Balog v Independent Commission Against Corruption [1990] HCA 28; 169 CLR 625 at 635-636 (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ); Hadjigeorgiou v New South Wales Crime Commission [2007] NSWCA 197; 174 A Crim R 124 at [95]. The taking of the property in the prescribed circumstance is the primary purpose of the legislation: Proceeds of Crime Act, s 5. The interests of a person in property the subject of a valid restraining order are deliberately and expressly at risk of confiscation, absent affirmative steps to exclude property on the application of the interested person. There is thus a clear and manifest intention to interfere with property rights. 
     
      
    22 The other general right upon which the applicant relies is that which is to be found in the “privilege against self-incrimination”. As explained by Allsop J in Griffin v Pantzer [2004] FCAFC 113; 137 FCR 209 (with the agreement of Ryan and Heerey JJ), once the privilege is held to operate outside curial proceedings, it may better be described as a fundamental right and not merely a testimonial privilege: at [44]; relying on Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9; 152 CLR 328 at 340-341 (Mason ACJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ stating that the principle was “too fundamental a bulwark of liberty to be categorized simply as a rule of evidence applicable to judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings”). That being accepted, the scope of the right is nevertheless encapsulated in similar terms to the evidential privilege and operates so as to prevent a person being required to answer a question, or provide a document which, in either case, may have an incriminating effect. (It is not necessary for present purposes to consider other means of self-incrimination.) 
     
      
    (c) examination orders23 The potential for such a consequence is expressly recognised by the Proceeds of Crime Act. Thus, Pt 3-1 of the Act dealing with examinations, makes it an offence to fail or refuse to answer a question that the approved examiner requires the person to answer: s 196(1)(b). Similarly, the section makes it an offence to refuse to produce a document specified in the examination notice: s 196(1)(c). That obligation is, however, subject to an exception in circumstances where, under another law, the person “could not, in proceedings before a court, be compelled to answer the question or produce the document”: s 197(1). That qualification to the obligation is then removed where “the only reason or reasons why the person could not be so compelled” is, inter alia, that “answering the question or producing the document would tend to incriminate the person or to expose the person to a penalty”: s 197(2)(a). 
     
      
    24 The imposition of the obligation, subject to a qualification which is expressed and then withdrawn, are followed by a further provision providing a limited protection by way of “use immunity”: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        198 Admissibility of answers and documents 
          
         
          
          An answer given or document produced in an examination is not admissible in evidence in civil or criminal proceedings against the person who gave the answer or produced the document except:  
           
          (a) in criminal proceedings for giving false or misleading information; or  
           
          (b) in proceedings on an application under this Act; or  
           
          (c) in proceedings ancillary to an application under this Act; or  
           
          (d) in proceedings for enforcement of a confiscation order; or  
           
          (e) in the case of a document, in civil proceedings for or in respect of a right or liability it confers or imposes.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    25 This legislative scheme recognises in express terms the availability of the right not to incriminate oneself and removes it in respect of answers and documents sought in an examination under the Act. While it provides protection against use of such answers and documents, that protection does not extend to proceedings or an application under the Act itself, whether or not there could have been objection on the grounds of self-incrimination in those proceedings. Finally, the terms of s 198 are carefully formulated so as to render the answers or documents inadmissible in evidence, but not to exclude their use in other ways. This reflects the underlying purposes of the examination, the details of which are not presently relevant. Certain other protections are provided, at the discretion of the examiner, permitting directions preventing or restricting the disclosure of answers or documents to the public (s 193), but otherwise, the scope of the use to which an answer or a document may be put will depend upon the purpose of the examination.  
     
      
    (d) forfeiture orders26 The second kind of order relevantly available under the Act is a forfeiture order under s 49. There is likely to be no basis for resistance to such an order unless the Director is required to satisfy the Court that the property is proceeds of one or more relevant offences. Such a finding is not, however, required if the Court is satisfied that no application has been made for property to be excluded from the restraining order, pursuant to Pt 2-1, Div 3 of the Act: s 49(3). 
     
      
    (e) exclusion orders27 An application to exclude property which is subject to a restraining order requires the Court to be satisfied that “the property is neither the proceeds of an indictable offence, a foreign indictable offence or an indictable offence of Commonwealth concern”, for the purposes of s 19: s 29(2)(d)(i). It has been held that the applicant has the burden of proving the matters sought to be established under s 29(2) as ground for excluding the property from the scope of the restraining order: see s 317(1) and Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Hart (No 2) [2005] 2 Qd R 246 at [10]-[12] (McPherson JA, Williams JA agreeing) and [49] (Chesterman J, Williams JA agreeing). That burden was not in dispute in the present proceedings, the applicant indeed relying upon the difficulty he would face in seeking to obtain such an order, without giving evidence and thus placing himself at risk of self-incrimination. 
     
      
    28 Further, an application for exclusion of property must not be heard if the Director “has not been given a reasonable opportunity to conduct an examination of the applicant”: s 32. This requirement, the applicant contended, meant that, in order to resist a forfeiture order, he not merely had to seek an order excluding property from the scope of the restraining order, but before doing so, had to submit to an examination. (It will be necessary to revisit this contention shortly.) 
     
      
    (f) revocation orders29 The other possibility open to the applicant to avoid forfeiture, is to pursue relief sought in his notice of motion for an order revoking the restraining order, pursuant to s 42 of the Act. 
     
      
    30 Section 42(5) empowers the Court to revoke the restraining order “if satisfied that there are no grounds on which to make the order at the time of considering the application to revoke the order”. It has been held that this provision imposes on the applicant a burden of so satisfying the court. Because the Director may adduce material to the court and the applicant may need to rely upon his or her own evidence, there is no reason to suppose that the factual basis for the court’s determination need be the same as that relied upon when the original order was made. Whether the relevant statutory basis for an order must be the same as that relied upon in making the restraining order has not been decided: see Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth); re Sunshine World Holdings Ltd [2005] NSWSC 117; 62 NSWLR 400 at [19] (Greg James J). The nature of the test has also not been determined, the possibility that “irrational, improper or unlikely grounds for suspicion” might be sufficient to sustain an order having been left open in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Tan [2003] NSWSC 717 at [14] (Shaw J). It seems preferable, however, to treat s 42(5) as requiring satisfaction at the time of the revocation hearing as to the absence of such grounds as could have been relied upon to justify a restraining order, being the grounds specified in whichever of ss 17, 18 or 19 formed the basis of the original order. On that view, the order would be liable to revocation if the Court were satisfied that there were no reasonable grounds for the suspicion which had been relied upon. 
     
      
    31 None of these issues need be resolved for present purposes. What is relevant is that in seeking a revocation order, the applicant is not precluded from relying upon the privilege against self-incrimination. The withdrawal of that right only operates with respect to particular processes provided for under the Proceeds of Crime Act, being examination orders in Ch 3, Pt 3-1 and production orders under Pt 3-2. 
     
      
    Power to stay proceedings32 Against this understanding of the statutory scheme, it is necessary to return to the applicant’s submission that the orders sought in the summons should be stayed. As already noted, that should be understood as an application for a stay of the proceedings in which that relief was sought. 
     
      
    33 The starting point for the applicant’s argument in this regard was that by –  
     
      
       
      (a) defending the application for the forfeiture order; 
       
      (b) attending or subjecting himself to an examination under s 180, or 
       
      (c) seeking to exclude property from the restraining order,  
       
       
      the applicant might prejudice his defence of any future criminal charge by – 
       
      (d) providing the Director with information or evidence that is not presently in his possession and which may assist any criminal case brought against the applicant by Australian or Malaysian prosecuting authorities; 
       
      (e) alerting the Director to further information that may enable him to conduct further lines of inquiry that may assist in any criminal case brought against the applicant by Australian or Malaysian prosecuting authorities, or 
       
      (f) providing information or evidence that might otherwise incidentally benefit any criminal case to be brought against him. 
       
       
      (This summary of the applicant’s position is taken from his written summary of argument, par 35 and the transcript of the hearing on 3 September 2009 in this Court, at p 2(20). It does not refer to an application to revoke the restraining order, which was contained within the notice of motion filed by the applicant, but not specifically relied on for the purposes of the argument.) 
       
      
    34 The applicant also challenged the “guidelines” set out by Wootten J in McMahon v Gould, 7 ACLR at 206-207 as no longer properly reflecting the approach to be adopted on a stay application in relation to civil proceedings where criminal proceedings were pending against the defendant. The applicant contended that Wootten J had underrated the “right to silence” and the potential for prejudice in the criminal proceedings, by focusing squarely on the potential prejudice to the plaintiff in the civil proceedings, if they were to be stayed. It was noted that Wootten J had treated the right to silence as “a convenient rubric for several rules and practices which have various origins and serve various purposes”: p 207. These were the right to refuse to answer questions in the course of police interrogation; the right not to give evidence at a criminal trial and not to have adverse comment on a failure to give sworn evidence, and the right to refuse to answer questions which might tend to incriminate, in the course of legal proceedings generally. That summary, the applicant contended, pre-dated the acceptance by the High Court that the privilege against self-incrimination was not merely an evidential or testimonial privilege, but a right which was fundamental to the proper administration of justice. 
     
      
    35 McMahon v Gould is distinguishable from the present case. Nevertheless, from the applicant’s point of view, it provided an obstacle to his claim for a stay because the absence of a clear entitlement to a stay in a case where criminal charges had been laid made it more difficult to contend for a stay in his case, where not only had no criminal charge been laid, but it was not clear that the applicant would be charged with an indictable offence: cf Proceeds of Crime Act, s 17(1)(d). 
     
      
    36 The analogy relied upon by the applicant was that in McMahon v Gould not merely were there criminal proceedings on foot, but, at least in relation to the statutory offences under the Companies Act 1961 (NSW), which formed part of the basis of the liquidator’s proceedings against the defendant, the defendant was not entitled to resist making full discovery by answer to interrogatories, or from answering any question, by reliance on the privilege against self-incrimination. 
     
      
    37 The applicant called in aid the decision of the High Court in Reid v Howard (above at [7]). That case is authority for the proposition that the Supreme Court, exercising powers under s 23 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), is not entitled to require that a person answer questions which might otherwise engage the privilege against self-incrimination, by crafting orders which significantly diminish the use of the answers in criminal proceedings. In short, the Court has no power to override the privilege, so as to prevent it defeating a plaintiff’s rights in civil proceedings, absent statutory authority. This case was relevant in two respects. The first was its affirmation of the principle that the privilege against self-incrimination “is not simply a rule of evidence, but a basic and substantive common law right”: at 11 (Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ). Secondly, it recognised that the common law right provided protection not merely against the use in evidence of compelled admissions, but also against disclosure which may set in train a process leading to other incriminating material: at 6-7 (Deane J, referring to Rank Film Distributors Ltd v Video Information Centre [1982] AC 380 at 443 (Lord Wilberforce) and Sorby v The Commonwealth [1983] HCA 10; 152 CLR 281 at 294-5 (Gibbs CJ) and 310 (Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ)). 
     
      
    38 There was no challenge to the view that the Court had power to grant a stay of steps which might be taken under the Proceeds of Crime Act where that course was necessary to avoid an apprehended abuse of process. That power was implicitly acknowledged in the statutory limitation on its exercise in the following provision: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        319 Stay of proceedings 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The fact that criminal proceedings have been instituted or have commenced (whether or not under this Act) is not a ground on which a court may stay proceedings under this Act that are not criminal proceedings.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    39 What precisely may be included in the concept of a criminal proceeding under the Proceeds of Crime Act was not addressed in submissions. The Act creates offences in respect of persons disposing of property subject to a restraining order (s 37) and for contravening an ancillary order relating to foreign property (s 40); it also creates offences for failing to attend an examination or refusing or failing to answer questions at an examination: ss 195 and 196. Criminal proceedings in relation to conduct which has given rise to a suspicion with respect to property rendering it liable to a restraining order and forfeiture, will generally involve a contravention of another law, such as the Criminal Code. While it was not suggested that s 319 operated in the present case, the Director did contend that, if the existence of criminal proceedings against the applicant would not provide a ground for a stay, it followed that the possibility of criminal proceedings which were not presently in contemplation, could not provide an appropriate basis for a stay either. 
     
      
    40 By way of response, the applicant argued that, had charges been laid, he would have known the precise manner in which the case against him was formulated. That, however, must be a limited basis for distinguishing the circumstances. Even where charges have been laid, it does not follow that further or different charges may not be laid if the results of an examination lead to fresh material becoming available to the Director. Further, it could readily be expected that if criminal proceedings were on foot, there would be an application for a stay in any event, because the risk of harm to the defence case would be all the more immediate from a compulsory examination by the prosecutor contemporaneously with such proceedings. An application for a stay would then not usually be based merely upon the “fact” that criminal proceedings have commenced, but rather on the particular circumstances which might arise in a particular case, such as the potential for specific prejudice to any positive defence the applicant might wish to bring: see, eg, State of Queensland v Shaw [2003] QSC 436 at [13] ff (Mackenzie J). There may be uncertainty as to the precise scope of the ground on which a stay is unavailable by reason of s 319. 
     
      
    41 Putting s 319 to one side, it may be accepted that the dilemma posed for the applicant is real. It is, of course, not a dilemma faced only by a guilty applicant who needs to create a plausible explanation for otherwise suspicious circumstances. The risk applies (at least to some extent) to an innocent party whose property has been restrained under a misapprehension. Even a party with an innocent explanation may be disbelieved and not merely fail to recover the property, but find himself or herself at risk of criminal prosecution. 
     
      
    42 Significantly, there may be variations on that theme: see Shaw at [22]. For example, a person who is innocent of obtaining the money in the fraudulent manner suspected by the Director may nevertheless, in demonstrating a legitimate basis for an interest in the property, reveal the commission of other offences, such as a failure to declare to the Commissioner of Taxation the proceeds of a legitimate business enterprise. Such a possibility reveals a difficulty with the application for a stay, requiring a degree of precision in the terms proposed. Is the stay to be conditioned upon an undertaking from the Director that the applicant will not be charged with breaches of the law in Australia of which he is presently suspected, or must it relate to any offences under Australian law? Similarly, there is a difficulty posed by the potential for prosecution under the laws of a foreign country, in this case Malaysia. 
     
      
    43 Accepting the principles established in the cases in the High Court, relied upon by the applicant, there is no warrant to consider further the guidelines proposed by Wootten J in McMahon v Gould. It is likely that they may require further consideration in an appropriate case, but the quite specific statutory context of the present matter requires that this case be determined in its own legal context. 
     
      
    Application of principles(a) general considerations44 In considering whether to grant a stay on any terms, there is an important distinction to be drawn between: 
     
      
       
      (a) an order compelling answers to questions or production of documents; 
       
      (b) proceedings in which the defendant is not entitled, by statute, to rely upon the privilege against self-incrimination, and 
       
      (c) proceedings where the privilege applies, but in practice the defendant will be compelled to reveal information which might otherwise fall within the scope of the privilege. 
       
      
    45 An order under s 180 may fall within the first category; an exclusion order or a revocation order sought by the applicant would fall within the third category. Unlike Reid v Howard, putting aside the examination order, this is not a case in which the plaintiff in civil proceedings seeks to compel disclosure by the applicant of material which may place him in jeopardy of criminal proceedings. Rather, the applicant is placed in jeopardy consequentially by the step taken by the Director of obtaining a restraining order in relation to property in which the applicant has an interest. 
     
      
    (b) examination order46 The making of an order for examination of a person is discretionary: s 180(1). The person who may be the subject of such an order includes: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) a person whose property is, or a person who has or claims an interest in property that is, the subject of the restraining order; or  
         
        (b) a person whom the restraining order states to be a suspect for the offence to which the restraining order relates; or  
         
        (c) the spouse or de facto partner of a person referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).”  
        
       
      
    47 In the present case, the examination order sought in the summons did not state that any person was a suspect for the offence to which it related, nor did it seek to cover any spouse or partner of the applicant. 
     
      
    48 The subject matter of an examination is “the affairs (including the nature and location of any property) of a person referred to” in one of the sub-paragraphs listed above. The order sought in the present case required that the applicant be examined about his affairs (including the nature and location of any property). 
     
      
    49 So far as the examination order is concerned, the present proceedings have an air of prematurity. There are two steps which must occur before the applicant can be examined. First, the Court must make an order permitting the examination; secondly, an approved examiner must give the applicant, once the subject of an examination order, a written notice for his examination: s 183(1). Each of these powers is discretionary and remains to be exercised. Why this Court should interfere to prevent the consideration of the exercise of those powers, in the first instance by a judge of the Court, was not explained in the course of the appeal. Subject to questions of authority, the refusal of the trial judge to grant the relief sought by the applicant merely permits the application for an examination order to be listed for consideration by a member of the Court in the future. Unless there were some legal or factual impediment to the Court properly considering whether to make such an order when sought, it would have been quite inappropriate for the primary judge to grant the relief sought by the applicant in relation to a proposed examination order. 
     
      
    (c) exclusion order50 An application for an exclusion cannot be heard unless the Director has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct an examination of the applicant. As noted above, the only effective way of resisting a forfeiture order was to seek an exclusion order. But that, it was contended, required him, in practical terms to submit to an examination, without the protection of the privilege against self-incrimination. 
     
      
    51 The last step in the argument does not necessarily follow from the statutory scheme. What it does reveal, however, is that there remains a discretionary order with respect to any examination. The Court might yet refuse such an order, or delay its consideration. On current authority, refusal of an examination order would not mean that the Director had not had a reasonable opportunity “to conduct an examination of the applicant” see Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Chan [2004] ACTSC 101; 185 FLR 399; 150 A Crim R 163 at [29] (Crispin J). Critical to the reasoning in Chan were two elements of the statutory scheme, namely that the Director had no entitlement to examine a person absent an order which lay within the discretion of the Court and, secondly, the unlikelihood that Parliament intended to preclude a person from obtaining an exclusion order because the Court thought it inappropriate to permit an examination. Crispin J variously described the discretionary power conferred by s 180 as requiring the Court to be satisfied that the examination of the particular person is “necessary” – at [26] – or that “there are adequate grounds” for the order – at [27]. Clearly Crispin J was concerned that, merely by seizing property on a suspicion based on reasonable grounds, the Director could establish a basis for conducting an examination of a suspect without the right to refuse to answer questions that might incriminate the person. His Honour considered, no doubt correctly, that the purpose of an examination under s 180 should be limited to circumstances where there were real questions as to the true position with respect to the source and ownership of property subject to a restraining order and, possibly other property which might be the proceeds of crime: at [26]. The conclusion in Chan thus involved treating s 32 as satisfied where the Director had had a reasonable opportunity to seek an examination order and, if the application had been granted, to conduct the examination. 
     
      
    52 Because no Court has been asked to adjudicate on the request for an examination order in the present case, the issue as to the correct approach to such an order has not yet arisen. It is not appropriate for this Court to pre-empt the exercise of discretion by a single judge from whom an examination order has yet to be sought in relation to the applicant. Further, the applicant has not yet sought an exclusion order. 
     
      
    (d) forfeiture order53 Unless the applicant obtains a stay with respect to the Director’s application, and disregarding the Director’s application for an examination order, the Director will presumably be in a position to obtain a forfeiture order forthwith. As has already been noted, the basis for a forfeiture order will differ depending upon whether an application for an exclusion order has been made and not withdrawn, as opposed to the case in which no such application has been made. 
     
      
    54 It has been accepted in other cases that the applicant for an exclusion order bears the onus of proving the matters necessary to establish the grounds for making the order: see [27] above. However, what is less clear is whether it is sufficient for there to be an application for an exclusion order, which need not necessarily be determined, in order to place on the Director the obligation of satisfying the Court that the property is the proceeds of a relevant offence under s 49(1)(c). If, as appears from the wording of the section, the obligation of the Director to satisfy the Court under s 49(1)(c) that the property is the proceeds of an offence is engaged merely by making an exclusion order, which need not be determined, the legal burden of proof is not on the applicant, but on the Director. Although the applicant’s position, forensically, may militate in favour of him giving evidence, there is no provision removing the privilege against self-incrimination for the purposes of such proceedings. In that event, the arguments in favour of a stay are greatly reduced. 
     
      
    (e) exercise of power55 It may be that the applicant’s argument in the present case was intended to be based on the acceptance of a practical, if not legal, burden of establishing by evidence facts sufficient to remove the grounds for suspicion arising from the Director’s evidence. In that case, the attempt to stay the proceedings, so as to prevent the Director seeking a forfeiture order, must be based on broad considerations concerning the scheme of the legislation: see Shaw [2003] QSC 436 at [19]. 
     
      
    56 The dilemma faced by the applicant is one which must arise frequently, if not usually, in such proceedings. Where s 19 is invoked, it may be assumed that the Director is not in a position to lay charges. Accordingly, a stay on the terms sought, namely until the applicant is advised “that he will be charged with one or more offences to which the restraining order relates, and the precise nature of any such charges” is apt to constitute a permanent stay in practical terms. The restraining order would then remain in place and the property be frozen. The alternative is that the stay remain in place until the Director provides an assurance that the applicant will not be prosecuted in relation to property the subject of the restraining order. 
     
      
    57 In Reid v Howard the joint judgment noted a submission that “prosecution authorities cannot be bound” by an assurance or an order of the Court, at least in proceedings in which they were not parties. The correctness of that view was not determined: at 16. Whether the Director could or should give such an assurance may be doubted in the present case; further, it seems unlikely that he has any power to give such an assurance on behalf of Malaysian authorities, although it might be possible to seek an assurance that no information would be supplied to them. Similar problems might arise in relation to State authorities. 
     
      
    58 In any event, the statutory structure makes such an undertaking, condition or assurance inappropriate. It is clear that the power to proceed under the Proceeds of Crime Act was not intended to put the Director to an election, requiring that he or she first institute criminal proceedings or disclaim an entitlement to proceed later by way of criminal charges. Putting to one side the power to require an examination of the applicant, the statutory scheme is consistent with the applicant being required to make a choice as to whether to seek to defend the forfeiture proceedings, at the risk of revealing incriminating material, or to hold his or her hand and permit the forfeiture of the property. To permit the proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act to continue, absent some specific factor, will not generally constitute an abuse of the statutory scheme. 
     
      
    59 Considering the matter at that level of generality, the statutory scheme is inconsistent with a stay, absent a specific justification. A stay for a significant period has potential financial consequences for both sides. No doubt the person with an interest in the property is most severely disadvantaged, but the Commonwealth is also at risk because restraining orders are usually conditioned on an undertaking with respect to payment of damages: Proceeds of Crime Act, s 21. Such an undertaking was given in the present case. 
     
      
    The case-law60 There remains a question as to whether the foregoing statements of principle are consistent with those adopted by the Queensland Court of Appeal in DPP v Jo: see above at [6]). 
     
      
    61 DPP v Jo is distinguishable. First, the application for leave to appeal sought to challenge the grant of a stay of proceedings (for a limited period). The challenge by the Director was based upon the proposition that the material before the primary judge “did not afford a sufficient basis upon which to grant a stay” and that his Honour took into account an irrelevant consideration, “namely the length of time it was taking for the criminal charges to crystallize”: at [9]. Except to the extent that the applicant seeks to obtain assistance from the reasons for granting the stay on the part of the primary judge, limited assistance can be derived from a refusal to interfere with a stay in circumstances where the applicant must establish an error of principle as a basis for interfering with a refusal to grant a stay. 
     
      
    62 Secondly, the restraining order had been obtained by the Director under s 18 of the Proceeds of Crime Act, not s 19. The sections vary in an important respect. The relevant suspicion under s 18 is that a person has committed a serious offence. By contrast, under s 19, the relevant suspicion relates to property, being the proceeds of certain kinds of offences, rather than to the commission of an offence by a particular person. Moreover, the statutory scheme provides separately for a forfeiture order founded on a restraining order made under s 18 (s 47(1)) and a forfeiture order founded on a restraining order made under s 19 (s 49(1)). The requirements that must be satisfied under s 47 and s 49 are quite different. In particular, s 47 has no equivalent to s 49(3). The case for disclosure of the details of a charge is clearly stronger in circumstances where the suspicion relates to the commission of an offence, as opposed to property being the proceeds of an offence. 
     
      
    63 Thirdly, the stay granted was for a period of a little over nine months, it being anticipated that criminal charges were to “crystallize” within that period: at [8] and [23].  
     
      
    64 The applicant accepted that Mr Jo was likely to be charged, but noted that the approach adopted by the Queensland Court of Appeal treated similarly both Mr and Mrs Jo (and a company), even though there appears to have been no indication that Mrs Jo would be charged. The basis upon which the Court of Appeal upheld the reasoning of the trial judge may be found at [20], in the judgment of Wilson J, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “They cannot be precise about how their defending forfeiture proceedings including by bringing exclusion applications – which would expose them to the likelihood of examinations in the course of which they would have to answer questions about their affairs – may prejudice his defence of criminal charges (on which the [Director] will most probably bear the onus of proof) when they do not know what those charges will be. By going into evidence in the forfeiture proceedings they may afford the [Director] an advantage in the criminal proceedings … and they may both waive their privilege against self-incrimination. On present indications, the risk of waiving the privilege against self-incrimination is particularly acute in Mr Jo’s case.” 
        
       
      
    65 There are difficulties with this reasoning. First, as noted above, it seems doubtful whether the likelihood of an examination order should be taken into account in circumstances where no judge has considered whether such an order should be made and no approved examiner has been appointed. 
     
      
    66 Secondly, the fact that the Director may obtain a forensic advantage if the person gave evidence is likely to arise in every case in which forfeiture proceedings are sought to be maintained before the completion of any criminal proceedings. Wilson J noted that if charges were laid, then Mr and Mrs Jo “should be able to particularise the prejudice in the criminal proceedings, and unless they do so, they will be unlikely to obtain a further stay”: at [23]. Just how the risk would be explained to the Court at any level of particularity, without jeopardising the privilege, is unclear: cf, eg, Shaw [2003] QSC 436 at [11]. The provisions which were said to have been contravened by a tax avoidance scheme had already been identified, as had the dates during which the scheme operated, and the property restrained involved water craft and motor vehicles: [4]-[6]. Much was already known.  
     
      
    67 More importantly, the premise upon which this reasoning is based is that if a person can identify potential prejudice, in the sense that the Director may obtain a forensic advantage in being able to test their evidence or that of their witnesses, that will constitute a sufficient basis for a stay. That reasoning goes close to requiring the Director to determine the charges and proceed with them before pursuing a forfeiture order, at least where the application for a forfeiture order is made under s 47(1) on the basis of a restraining order in force under s 18. For the reasons indicated above, such an approach would be inconsistent with the apparent purpose and structure of the statutory scheme for confiscation of proceeds of crime, at least under ss 19 and 49. 
     
      
    68 Wilson J also noted that the primary judge “was astute to the objects of the legislation and to the fundamental nature of the privilege against self-incrimination”: at [22]. After setting out a passage stating matters of principle, from the judgment of the primary judge, her Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “The inherent jurisdiction of the Courts to preserve the privilege against self-incrimination cannot remain paramount in the face of a clear legislative intent to abrogate that privilege by requiring persons such as Mr and Mrs Jo to answer questions at an examination conducted under the Act. But that point has not yet been reached, and the stay application was designed (at least in part) to stop it being reached. In that context, the Court clearly has inherent power to uphold the privilege by granting a stay.” 
        
       
      
    69 The intended scope of this passage may be quite limited. The existence of power to grant a stay can be accepted and indeed was conceded in the present case. However, for reasons given above, it is inappropriate to pre-empt the consideration of whether an examination order should be made and whether the approved examiner will exercise his or her power to give an examination notice. Both the Court, and the approved examiner, in considering the exercise of their powers will no doubt be invited to have regard to the fact that the Act does not permit a person to decline to answer questions on the basis of the privilege. However, an offence is committed only where the person refuses or fails to answer a question “that the approved examiner requires the person to answer”: s 196(1)(b). How widely the approved examiner would permit the examination to go, in exploring matters which might be relevant primarily to the person’s defence, is a further unknown. The intervention of the court to pre-empt all of these decision-making powers being exercised, should only be contemplated where there is some basis for concluding that there would otherwise be an abuse of process. The statute is inconsistent with the proposition that an abuse of process necessarily arises merely because there are outstanding charges pending or because there is the possibility that charges may later be laid. 
     
      
    70 McMurdo P agreed with the reasons give by Wilson J and with the separate reasons of Lyons J. Lyons J also agreed with Wilson J and added at [26]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Courts have an inherent power to uphold the privilege against self-incrimination where it is in the interests of justice to do so particularly to protect the rights of an individual and to prevent an abuse of process.” 
        
       
      
    71 This language adopts an abuse of process test in exercise of power of the Court to grant a stay, to uphold the privilege. The critical issue is the circumstances in which the privilege should be ‘upheld’. 
     
      
    72 His Honour continued at [27]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In his reasons the primary judge observed that the respondents would defend any criminal prosecutions brought and that the respondents’ solicitor had instructions to bring exclusion applications. To pursue those exclusion applications however the respondents bear the onus of satisfying the court that the restrained property was not the proceeds of criminal activity.” 
        
       
      
    73 Lyons J then identified the test which appears to have been adopted by the primary judge, namely “that there was a real risk that the prosecution case may benefit from any evidence that may support a defence to any charges or from evidence that is adduced by the respondents on the exclusion proceeding”: at [29]. The primary judge also appears to have held that no specific evidence of prejudice had been made out: at [30]. Given the structure of the statute, discussed above, the mere fact that the Director may benefit from steps taken by the persons interested in the property to protect their property does not demonstrate an abuse of process in allowing the forfeiture proceedings to continue. 
     
      
    74 Lyons J also upheld the view of the primary judge that “to allow the proceedings to continue in the circumstance where the possibility of any criminal charges being laid is and remains – despite the effluxion of what seems to me to be an inordinate period of time – uncertain (or at least unknown) amounts to an abuse of process sufficient to grant a stay, at least temporarily”: at [30]. 
     
      
    75 Underlying this last proposition is the assumption that the forfeiture proceedings will be, or become, an abuse of process if no charge is laid within a reasonable time. However, the availability of proceedings based on s 18 of the Act is not conditioned on the laying of charges nor the existence of circumstances which would justify the laying of charges. 
     
      
    76 Underlying the reasoning in DPP v Jo there appears to have been a concern that an examination under Pt 3-1 of the Act could constitute an illegitimate attempt by the Director to obtain material sufficient to allow delaying of charges, or to bolster an existing charge. There are two difficulties with that approach. The first is the need to identify the limits of a legitimate examination under Pt 3-2; the second is to justify the grant of a stay without permitting the examination to go ahead in any form, or even permitting the court to consider whether to make an examination order. If there is a further assumption that an examination will always be an abuse of process where charges have not been laid, or possibly where they have been laid but have not been determined, such a view is inconsistent with the express purposes of the Proceeds of Crime Act. If some form of examination is thought to be legitimate, but there is a fear that the boundaries of legitimacy will be exceeded (again ignoring the fact that there are other mechanisms which would allow a person protection), a real risk of such an outcome, absent a stay of the forfeiture proceedings, must be demonstrated before a stay is appropriate. 
     
      
    77 It is sufficient for present purposes to accept that the reasoning in DPP v Jo is not directly applicable to the present proceedings for the reasons noted above. It is not necessary, therefore, to consider whether the reasoning underlying the decision is “plainly wrong”. However, in part it appears to embrace a view of the statutory scheme which is inconsistent with that outlined above and may therefore be doubted. 
     
      
    78 It remains to note a decision of Mackenzie J in the Supreme Court of Queensland, to which the primary judge was taken in the present case and which he declined to follow: at [22]. Shaw was clearly distinguishable: it was a case in which there were concurrent proceedings on foot under the Criminal Proceedings Confiscation Act 2002 (Qld) and for offences under the Drugs Misuse Act 1984 (Qld). After a careful analysis of the relevant principles, Mackenzie J posed the question, at [23], “where the issues are identical in the forfeiture proceedings and the [criminal] proceedings, should the State be afforded the opportunity to use the civil proceedings to test and potentially improve the case that it will rely upon in the criminal proceedings which involve identical issues?” His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “[24] In my view it is not appropriate to do so. Firstly, as the law stands, the respondent is in a more favourable position in the [criminal] proceedings with regard to disclosure of the material upon which his exculpatory explanation is based. Secondly, there are penal consequences flowing from a conviction.  
        
       
       
        
        [25] The case is one where there is a well defined and real advantage available to a person in criminal proceedings in respect of [not?] revealing evidence in advance. Depriving a defendant of such an advantage by requiring him to undergo prior proceedings where the State may, in effect, test-run the same case it proposes to lead in the prosecution proceeding and if necessary improve it if it can prior to that time is in my view sufficiently of the character of a demonstrated reason why the interests of justice would not be served by the forfeiture proceedings being heard in advance of the criminal proceedings. In my view the circumstances in which a stay is justified are established by the particular facts of the case.” 
        
       
      
    79 In his concluding remarks, Mackenzie J noted that a “rigorous analysis of the evidence … will generally be of importance in determining whether the requirements for a stay are made out”: at [26]. That view, which is not to be doubted, correctly limits the assistance which can be obtained by reference to the outcome in earlier cases. The reasoning was approved by Wilson J in DPP v Jo at [17]-[18]. Without doubting his Honour’s approach and the decision in that case, it did not mandate any particular outcome in the present case. 
     
      
    Conclusions on grounds of appeal80 The first ground of appeal asserted that the trial judge was in error in seeking to distinguish the decision in DPP v Jo. In fact the trial judge expressly noted that the restraining orders in Jo were made under s 18 of the Proceeds of Crime Act and that the forfeiture order was sought under s 47. For that reason, and the further reasons noted above, Jo was distinguishable. Whether his Honour should nevertheless have applied the principles upon which it appears to be founded is more doubtful. Arguably his Honour was wrong not to identify and apply the relevant principles established in the decision of an intermediate court of appeal in respect of Commonwealth legislation. Nevertheless, for the reasons given above those principles cannot be maintained as applicable under s 19 in the light of the statutory scheme. It is therefore not inappropriate to take a different approach to that adopted in DPP v Jo. 
     
      
    81 To the extent that his Honour declined to follow MacKenzie J in Shaw at [25], quoted by the primary judge at [17], his Honour did not err. 
     
      
    82 Grounds 2 and 3 challenged the test applied by the primary judge with respect to a stay of proceedings which sought both the examination of a person under s 180 and the forfeiture of property under s 49, in circumstances where the person was suspected of, but had not been charged with, committing criminal offences in relation to property to which the restraining order related. 
     
      
    83 The primary judge did not in terms formulate a test, nor did he distinguish between the elements of relief sought by the Director. There would have been reason to take a more particular approach with respect to the different elements of relief sought, as noted above. To do so would not have resulted in a different outcome. 
     
      
    84 Ground 3 alleged that the primary judge had failed to give “any practical consideration” to the impact that the refusal of a stay would have on the appellant’s privilege against self-incrimination and right to silence in any criminal proceedings for an offence to which the restraining order related. 
     
      
    85 That ground assumes that criminal proceedings may be laid and that it is possible to know what response the applicant will have to the laying of the charges. If the ground were intended to cover the potential benefit which might accrue to the Director from pursuing either an examination order or a forfeiture order, the ground must nevertheless fail. What may have been missing from the reasoning of the primary judge was a full consideration of the statutory scheme, dealing with different powers separately. However, such consideration should not lead to a different conclusion in the circumstances. 
     
      
    86 Ground 4 challenged his Honour’s conclusion that the attempt to limit the stay to the period until the applicant was informed “that he would not be charged with any offence to which the restraining order relates” was so broad as to be impracticable: at [25]. For the reasons noted above, there was no error in rejecting a stay conditioned in that way. Neither in his notice of motion in the Court below, nor in his notice of appeal, did the applicant attempt to formulate some more specific order. To the extent that a degree of specificity was provided in the written submissions before the primary judge, the proposed conditions were, as his Honour noted, impracticable, or inconsistent with the statutory scheme. That conclusion was not show to be erroneous. 
     
      
    87 Ground 5 alleged that the primary judge erred in applying the guidelines taken from McMahon v Gould. Those guidelines, it was asserted, were no longer good law. As the trial judge noted, the guidelines dealt with the exercise of the discretion to grant or refuse a stay of civil proceedings “where an offender was charged with a related criminal offence”: at [24]. Hidden J considered it unnecessary to set the guidelines out, merely stating that he accepted them “as a useful guide”. It is unclear to what extent reliance was placed upon them, given that this was not a case in which the defendant had been charged with a related criminal offence. 
     
      
    88 Further, it would not have been appropriate for his Honour to dismiss the guidelines as requiring reconsideration in circumstances where they had obtained at least implicit approval from a majority in this Court in Yuill v Spedley Securities Ltd (In liq) (1992) 8 ACSR 272, despite the variation in the common law with respect to the “felony tort rule”, effected in Halabi v Westpac Banking Corporation (1989) 17 NSWLR 26. Even Kirby P in Yuill, having expressed the view that the guidelines should await further attention at a later date, accepted in Halabi that they “were now applied not only in this State but elsewhere”, noting the express approval given to them by McHugh JA and Samuels JA in Halabi. Kirby P concluded that the primary judge in Yuill, having expressly followed and applied those guidelines, had “conformed to the existing law”: at 274. See now Niven v SS [2006] NSWCA 338 at [2] (Beazley JA); at [25]-[37] (Tobias JA, Beazley and Giles JJA agreeing). 
     
      
    89 For reasons given above, the guidelines in McMahon v Gould may give too limited a weight to the general law immunity from compulsion to incriminate oneself, but the context of the Process of Crime Act renders it inappropriate to undertake a broad reconsideration of the terms of the guidelines or the circumstances in which they should properly apply. 
     
      
    90 The appellant has failed to establish grounds for this Court to intervene to grant a stay. The power to grant a stay required satisfaction of the Court that to allow the Director’s application to proceed would constitute an abuse of process. There is no suggestion that the present proceedings were instituted, or are sought to be pursued, for a purpose extraneous to those permitted by the Proceeds of Crime Act: see [58] above. 
     
      
    91 For these reasons, the application for leave should be granted, but the appeal dismissed and the applicant ordered to pay the respondent’s costs of the proceedings in this Court.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 LATHAM J: I agree with Fullerton J. 
     
      
    2 FULLERTON J: On 25 August 2008 the applicant entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court to two charges. The first alleged that he dealt with property reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime contrary to s 193C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, attracting a maximum period of 2 years imprisonment and the second that he committed robbery contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act, attracting a maximum period of 14 years imprisonment. He was committed to the District Court for sentence on both charges where he adhered to his pleas of guilty.  
     
      
    3 On 5 December 2008 he was sentenced by Toner DCJ to a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months in respect of the first charge. In respect of the second charge he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years, comprising a non-parole period of 18 months and a balance of term of 6 months. His Honour was not satisfied that the statutory ratio as provided for in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 should be disturbed. The terms of imprisonment for both offences were fixed to commence on 1 September 2008.  
     
      
    4 The applicant initially filed an application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on both charges. However, prior to the hearing of the appeal, the applicant filed a Notice of Appeal in respect of his conviction on the first charge on the sole ground that an offence charged against s 193C(1) of the Crimes Act is, by operation of s 6 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, strictly a summary offence. Accordingly, the District Court did not have jurisdiction to deal with it. This Court was presented with the same circumstances in Hosseini v R [2009] NSWCCA 52. In that case the conviction was quashed. The Crown submitted that the appropriate order in the present case is that the conviction be quashed but to remit the matter to the Local Court pursuant to s 8A of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The applicant did not submit to the contrary.  
     
      
    5 In the result, the only remaining challenge is to the sentence imposed on the robbery charge.  
     
      
    The facts of the robbery charge 
     
      
    6 A set of agreed facts were tendered on the sentence proceedings. His Honour described the facts of the robbery as somewhat peculiar. They are set out in full in the remarks on sentence.  
     
      
    7 In summary, the robbery occurred inside the Flame Grill Chicken Shop at Padstow at 12.15pm on 28 April 2008. The applicant was inside the shop when the victim, a 16-year-old, entered the shop to order a meal. The applicant and the victim were known to one another. As the victim paid the shopkeeper for his meal and was given change in return the applicant took the money and said “You’re paying for my meal now”. The victim then went to the rear of the shop, took his backpack off and placed it on a table. The applicant followed him. The victim asked the shopkeeper to call the police but he was ignored. The applicant then accused the victim of robbing another person, which he denied. The applicant then grabbed hold of the victim and demanded that he hand over his belongings saying that he would kill him if he didn’t comply. The applicant took $50 from the victim’s wallet and a mobile phone from his jeans pocket. He then demanded that the victim give him the Nokia brand headphones he was wearing around his neck. The applicant then left the shop with the victim’s backpack. The victim contacted police. Police went to the chicken shop and seized the CCTV footage.  
     
      
    8 A search warrant was executed at the applicant’s home on 6 May 2008. Police located the clothing he was wearing on the day of the robbery and the backpack he was carrying. Inside the backpack was a set of headphones. No other property was recovered. He told police in a recorded interview that he took the victim’s property but denied that he applied any force. He also told police that the victim’s backpack was in a friend’s car and that the mobile phone was given to another friend. Neither of these people were named. The applicant was arrested and taken into custody.  
     
      
    The applicant’s prior record  
     
      
    9 At the time of his arrest the applicant was subject to the supervision of the New South Wales Drug Court under the terms of a suspension order imposed under s 7A(5) of the Drug Court Act 1998 after he entered pleas of guilty to one charge of driving whilst disqualified and one of goods in custody. The order suspending sentence was conditional on the applicant being of good behaviour and participating in a nominated drug treatment program. The sentencing judge properly assessed this as an aggravating feature in accordance with s 21A(2)(j) of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 10 As a consequence of his arrest the applicant’s participation in the Drug Court treatment program was terminated and he was called up for sentence. On 9 July 2008 he was sentenced by that Court to 10 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months. He was eligible for release to parole in respect of those offences on 11 December 2008, a week after the sentence proceedings in the District Court. The sentencing judge observed that the robbery offence could have been dealt with by the Drug Court and, were that to have occurred, in all probability some degree of concurrence would have been applied to reflect the principal of totality. It was for that reason that he ordered that the sentence for the robbery commence on 1 September 2008.  
     
      
    11 The applicant had an extensive criminal record. His Honour characterised the applicant’s offending as comprising street offences and otherwise relatively petty matters. A significant number of convictions were entered in the applicant’s absence after warrants issued under s 80AA of the Justices Act 1902 (repealed). His record as a juvenile contained multiple entries for fines (on one occasion accompanied with a recognisance to be of good behaviour) and orders to perform community service. He was first sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 6 months in June 2007 at age 27 for a series of offences committed over a period of 18 months, including driving whilst disqualified, shoplifting, common assault and goods in custody. This was moderated to 4 months imprisonment on appeal to the District Court. Soon after his release from custody he committed further offences of driving whilst disqualified and goods in custody for which he was dealt with in the Drug Court first in February 2008 where his sentence was suspended and then in July 2008 when he was sentenced to imprisonment.  
     
      
    The applicant’s case on sentence 
     
      
    12 The applicant gave evidence that his past offending was as a consequence of his addiction to drugs, an addiction which commenced with his use of heroin as an adolescent and which developed into a chronic addiction to amphetamines as an adult. Under the supervision of the Drug Court he claimed to have made genuine attempts to address his addiction and remain drug free, albeit with admitted lapses, and to maintain regular employment. He said throughout the period of his participation in the drug treatment program until his arrest he committed himself to the shared custody and maintenance of his young son pursuant to orders made by the Family Court in April 2008.  
     
      
    13 He gave evidence that he was sorry for robbing the victim (a person he suspected of having robbed a friend of his) and not thinking through the consequences of his actions. Although the robbery does not appear to have been motivated by a need to obtain drugs, or to have been committed whilst he was subject to the influence of drugs, his performance over the 12 weeks of the drug treatment program before he was arrested was described by his Honour as “patchy at best”. He had tested positive to prohibited drugs on multiple occasions on urinalysis administered as part of the drug treatment program by the Drug Court with the most recent positive test result recorded three weeks before he was arrested.  
     
      
    14 A report from Mr Mark Milic, a clinical psychologist, was tendered on sentence. It detailed the applicant’s drug and alcohol history, his interrupted education, his work history and his current social circumstances. A report from Dr Alex Gilandas, a clinical psychologist and neuropsychologist, was also tendered. Both psychologists noted that the applicant was of above average intelligence, with a capacity to learn and to improve his level of adaptation. They also noted that he was motivated to participate actively in a structured drug rehabilitation program with some predicted success. At the Crown’s request Dr Gilandas attended the sentence proceedings and gave evidence. Under questioning from his Honour his attention was principally directed to an assessment of the applicant’s realistic prospects of rehabilitation, and his likely response to treatment in a non-custodial setting given his poor performance under the Drug Court treatment program.  
     
      
    The findings of fact for sentencing purposes15 The objective seriousness of the robbery was assessed by his Honour at the bottom of the range for offences of its kind, aggravated only by the fact that the applicant was on conditional liberty at the time of the offending. His Honour did not regard the applicant’s criminal history of great significance for sentencing purposes, from which I assume he did not regard his prior record as a statutory aggravating feature. He also accepted, although not without hesitation, that the applicant's contrition and remorse were genuine and that they operated in mitigation of sentence under s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    The significance of the plea of guilty 
     
      
    16 In his sentencing remarks his Honour noted that the applicant entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court and noted the Crown's concession that the pleas were entered at the first available opportunity. He did not however quantify the utilitarian value of the plea or make explicit reference to the sentence being discounted to reflect that fact. At the close of submissions on the first day of the sentencing proceedings his Honour indicated that he intended to impose a non-parole period of 18 months for the robbery. He made no reference at that time to having taken the plea of guilty into account in the calculation of sentence. When the sentencing order was imposed the following day he did not refer to the plea of guilty at all otherwise than to note that it had been entered in the Local Court before the Drug Court imposed sentence in July 2008, a matter he took into account in determining to order partial accumulation of the sentences.  
     
      
    17 The applicant submitted that his Honour’s failure to qualify the discount for the plea of guilty, and to refer expressly to the fact that it had been taken into account in the calculation of sentence was an error entitling him to be re-sentenced and that in that exercise a discount of 25 per cent should be applied reducing the non-parole period for the robbery by at least 6 months. 
     
      
    18 The applicant also submitted that his Honour was in error in refusing to make a finding of special circumstances. This was put on two bases. The first that his Honour had failed to give proper weight to Dr Gilandas’ opinion concerning the applicant’s predicted prospects of rehabilitation and secondly, because his Honour had partially accumulated the sentence for the robbery on the sentence imposed by the Drug Court. The applicant submitted that this Court should adjust the statutory ratio even if the first ground of the appeal is unsuccessful.  
     
      
    Ground 1:The sentencing judge erred in failing to identify, calculate or apply a sentencing discount to reflect the utilitarian value of the applicant's early plea of guilty19 The Crown accepted that his Honour did not make any explicit reference to the plea of guilty either when he indicated that a non-parole period of 18 months would be imposed at the end of the first day of proceedings or when he imposed sentence the following day. Although the Crown conceded that it would have been preferable for his Honour to have made it clear that he had applied a discount for the plea of guilty in accordance with the guideline judgment in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383, she submitted that the Court should not assume from his failure to do so that he failed to take into account the plea of guilty in the calculation of sentence, or that he failed to give it appropriate weight by discounting the sentence by 25 per cent. She placed particular emphasis on the fact that his Honour expressly acknowledged the Crown's concession that the pleas were entered at the first available opportunity, a clear acknowledgment that the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty had been assessed and that the sentence warranted a discount of 25 per cent.  
     
      
    20 The Crown relied upon the observations of Spigelman CJ in R v Lawrence [2005] NSWCCA 91 at [13]-[15] in support of the submission that in this case, as in Lawrence, it should be inferred that his Honour in fact applied the appropriate discount when imposing sentence, but had simply overlooked saying so: 
     
      
       
        
        [13] 
          
        The Applicant submits that the sentencing Judge fell into error in failing to give proper weight to the plea of guilty and in failing to make plain the fact that, and the extent to which, the Applicant's sentence was reduced for the plea. The Crown contends that his Honour did take into account the plea and it puts forward a plausible computation that the final head sentence of 27 months happens to constitute a 25% discount from the sentence of 36 months. Although this is a plausible, indeed likely, reconstruction, it would have been easy for his Honour to say so. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [14] 
          
        Goldring DCJ is an experienced District Court Judge. He cannot be unaware of the line of authority on this matter, particularly  
        Thomson and Houlton 
        , as affirmed in  
        R v Sharma 
          
        (2002) 54 NSWLR 300 
        . The guideline established in  
        Thomson 
         at 160 encouraged, but did not require, the sentencing judge to quantify any discount. It did, however, indicate that judges should explicitly state that the plea of guilty has been taken into account and added ""failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight"" (at 416 [160]). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [15] 
          
        This Court is, of course, aware of the pressures under which District Court Judges have to deliver their sentences and that it is easy not to state a fact that everybody knows is required to be taken into account. Nevertheless, the reasons given in  
        Thomson 
         for issuing a guideline included the need to ensure that participants in the New South Wales criminal justice system had no reason to be sceptical about whether or not the benefits of a guilty plea were in fact made available to accused. It would have been preferable, for that reason, if his Honour had mentioned that he had done so. However, in view of his Honour's long experience and the structure and length of the sentence he imposed, I am not prepared to act on the basis that his Honour failed to take into account the plea, or that he failed to give it appropriate weight. I think the likely situation is that contended for by the Crown: that his Honour commenced with a sentence of 36 months and applied a full discount. Accordingly, I would not uphold this ground of appeal. 
        
       
      
    21 The Crown submitted that it was open for this Court to adopt the approach of the Chief Justice in Lawrence and assume that his Honour commenced with an undiscounted sentence of 32 months such that, after applying a 25 per cent discount for the plea, the total term of imprisonment was reduced to 24 months and a non-parole period of 18 months fixed in accordance with the statutory ratio fixed by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    22 In his oral submissions counsel for the applicant also relied upon Lawrence but as a restatement of the principled approach to valuing a plea of guilty in a sentencing exercise. He drew particular support from the passage extracted above where the Chief Justice noted that although the guideline judgment does not require sentencing judges to quantify a discount for the plea of guilty, judges should explicitly state the fact that a plea of guilty has been taken into account as a failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight in the sentencing exercise. The applicant submitted that this Court would involve itself in an over-rationalisation of the approach of the sentencing judge in this case were we to assume that simply because it was open to conclude that his Honour applied a 25 per cent discount to an undiscounted sentence of 32 months to explain his appointment of 24 months (ie a notional starting point for sentence that was divisible by four) that was in fact what his Honour intended. He submitted that in circumstances where the sentencing judge assessed the objective criminality at the lower end of the range, and where the single feature of aggravation under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was largely counterbalanced by a range of mitigating factors, this Court could not be confident a reconstruction of the sentencing exercise in the way the Crown proposed afforded the applicant the benefit of the plea of guilty to which he was entitled.23 Despite the obvious attraction of the Crown’s analysis I am not persuaded that the approach in Lawrence can be safely applied in this case. For my part, I would be cautious about its application other than in those relatively rare cases where it can be safely inferred that a sentencing judge has forgotten to state expressly that a discount for the plea of guilty has been applied and its quantification. This is consistent with the approach of Hidden J in Morris, Morris and Snelson v R [2008] NSWCCA 182 at [21]-[23]. I am not satisfied that this is such a case. Although the Crown’s analysis is mathematically plausible, I do not consider it likely that his Honour commenced with a sentence of 2 years and 8 months (or 32 months) before application of the discount, although it may theoretically have been open for him to have done so. While it is clear that his Honour did not suggest that any particular leniency should be afforded the applicant, it is equally as clear that he did not regard the circumstances of the robbery as particularly serious. This was a finding open to him and one that the Crown on sentence did not seek to argue against. In addition, although his Honour was not persuaded that special circumstances had been demonstrated, he did not find that the applicant was without prospects of rehabilitation, although its weight as a factor in mitigation was likely to have been diminished by the applicant’s reoffending when subject to the drug treatment program administered by the Drug Court.  
     
      
    24 In the result, taking into account the tenor of the sentencing proceedings as a whole, and his Honour’s remarks on sentence in particular, I am left with the distinct impression that he overlooked the need to factor into the sentence a 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty. I am satisfied the error contended for in the first ground of appeal has been made out.  
     
      
    25 Before turning to consider the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, error having been established, I propose to deal briefly with the second ground of appeal.  
     
      
    Ground 2:His Honour was in error in refusing to make a finding of special circumstances either on the basis of the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation when proper weight is given to Dr Gilandas’ opinion or because of the partial accumulation of the robbery sentence26 I have already noted that Dr Gilandas reported favourably upon the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were he afforded appropriate treatment in a structured program. The sentencing judge sought clarification of his views as to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation particularly given his inconsistent response to treatment under the supervision of the Drug Court. On any fair reading of Dr Gilandas’ evidence his Honour was entitled to find that the best that any treatment program could offer the applicant was support and assistance in his resolve to cease all drug use, and that the optimum environment in which that will likely occur was in custody given his most recent and intermittent success in a non-custodial setting and for that reason an extended period on parole was not warranted. 
     
      
    27 In so far as the second ground of appeal also contends that insufficient weight was given to the question of accumulation his Honour was at pains to ensure that very issue was appropriately factored into the sentencing order and adjourned the proceedings overnight to consider when the sentence should commence having regard to the fact that the applicant was serving the sentence imposed by the Drug Court. When coupled with what this Court has recently emphasised in Leslie v R [2009] NSWCCA 203 at [70], namely that the extent of any adjustment to the statutory ratio specified in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is discretely at the discretion of the sentencing judge, such that only if a non-parole period is manifestly excessive should this Court intervene, the second ground of appeal must fail. Is another sentence warranted at law? 
     
      
    28 The Crown submitted that given the circumstances of the offending, in particular the age of the victim, the breach of conditional liberty granted to the applicant by the Drug Court within months of the robbery and his repeated lapses into drug use during that period, coupled with what was submitted to be a generous approach to the treatment of his prior record for sentencing purposes, this Court would be persuaded that no other sentence than an 18 month non-parole period with an additional term of 6 months is warranted at law. That submission was advanced by the Crown irrespective of whether the applicant made out error on either or both grounds of appeal.  
     
      
    29 While the submission has force I am not persuaded that his Honour understated the level of objective seriousness in what appears to me to be impulsive as distinct from a predatory robbery on a young person and where relatively mild force was applied to the young person when his property was taken. In addition, although the applicant’s improved work prospects and social integration are conditional on him ceasing drug use, a fair reading of his evidence and the tendered reports are suggestive of positive moves in that direction. In the result, I am persuaded that a lesser sentence is warranted at law.  
     
      
    30 The orders I propose are as follow: 
     
      
      1. The conviction entered in respect of the offence of dealing with property suspected of being the proceeds of crime is quashed and the matter remitted to the Local Court. 
       
      2. Leave to appeal against the sentence imposed in respect of the charge of robbery is granted and the appeal is allowed. 
       
      3. The sentence imposed on the robbery is quashed and in lieu thereof a non-parole period of 12 months and a balance of term of 6 months is imposed. The sentence is to commence on 1 September 2008. The applicant is entitled to be released. 
       
      
    31 SCHMIDT J: I agree with Fullerton J.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR:  
     
      
       
      INTRODUCTION 
       
       
      Lance Rawson is a farmhand. He has been for 44 years. Mostly his work has involved farm maintenance such as fencing, spraying weeds and clearing vegetation. Mr Rawson has had no formal training; he has learnt the skills he needs to be a farmhand on the job.  
       
      
    2 In late 2005, Mr Rawson was asked by the owner of rural land at Terranora, on the far north coast of NSW, to clear vegetation from the land. The land had previously been used for cropping, dairy and beef cattle grazing. It had been partly cleared, but regrowth of vegetation had occurred, particularly in the last few decades when agricultural use had declined. Regrowth included significant stands of exotic and noxious weeds, such as camphor laurel and privet, but also native rainforest species, including threatened species.3 Mr Rawson agreed to work, as an independent contractor, to clean up the property by cutting, poisoning and otherwise clearing vegetation and opening up pasture land. He was to be paid by the hour for work done.  
     
      
    4 From 1 December 2005 to about 7 September 2006, Mr Rawson cut, poisoned and otherwise injured vegetation on the land. The scale of activity was large. The land covered about 170 hectares. Around 35,000 to 40,000 camphor laurels, privets and other weeds, as well as nearly 1,200 threatened or vulnerable species of rainforest plants were cut and poisoned. The vegetation affected was scattered in clumps and corridors over the land. 
     
      
    5 The cutting and poisoning of the threatened plant species involved offences against s 118A(2) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974. Mr Rawson was charged with seven offences, relating to seven different threatened species. Mr Rawson has pleaded guilty to each of the offences. The pleas of guilty constitute an admission of the “essential legal ingredients of the offences.”  
     
      
    6 However, there has been a contest as to the factual basis of the conduct constituting the offences and on which the Court should sentence, including the number of whole plants of each of the seven threatened species that Mr Rawson picked, whether Mr Rawson picked plants he denied picking, whether Mr Rawson knew the plants he picked were or might be threatened species or protected by law and the motive or purpose for Mr Rawson committing the offences, including whether he picked the plants to remove constraints on a development being planned for the land by the owner of the land.  
     
      
    7 As a consequence, it has been necessary for the Court to hold a sentencing hearing to resolve by accusatorial process upon evidence before the court, the facts upon which the Court should pass sentence: Chow v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 593 at 605, 607 and R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 at [21]. (In the United Kingdom, this is called a Newton hearing after the UK Court of Appeal decision in R v Newton (1982) 77 Cr App R 13 at 15 in which this type of sentence hearing to resolve disputed facts was discussed). 
     
      
       
      THE OFFENCES 
       
       
      The charges 
       
      
    8 Mr Rawson is charged with seven offences against s 118A(2) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 that from about 1 December 2005 and continuing until about 7 September 2006, he picked plants that were of a threatened species.  
     
      
    9 The threatened species were identified in each of the seven charges. They were: for 50077/07, Gossia fragrantissima (also known as Austromyrtus fragrantissima); for 50078/07, Hicksbeachia pinnatifolia; for 50079/07, Grevillea hilliana; for 50080/07, Macadamia tetraphylla; for 50081/07, Lepiderema pulchella; for 50082/07, Randia moorei; and for 50083/07, Acacia bakeri.10 In the particulars, the place at which the picking occurred was given as “at or near Terranora in the State of New South Wales (being land known as Lot 2 of DP 867486, Lot 33 of DP 1085109 and Lot 4 of DP 822786)”. 
     
      
    11 The manner of contravention was that Mr Rawson “cut and/or poisoned and/or otherwise injured the plants which were of the threatened species”. 
     
      
    12 The number of plants varied depending on the threatened species concerned. At the end of the evidence at the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor amended the particulars of the numbers of plants for each charge to be as follows:

       32 
       
      
     
     
      
       
      
    13 Threatened species include endangered species and vulnerable species. The penalties for an offence against s 118A(2) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 vary depending upon whether the threatened species is classified as endangered or vulnerable.  
     
      
    14 Three of the species picked were endangered, namely Gossia fragrantissima, Grevillea hilliana and Randia moorei.  The other four species picked were vulnerable, namely Hicksbeachia pinnatifolia, Macadamia tetraphylla, Lepiderema pulchella and Acacia bakeri. 
     
      
       
      The facts of the offences 
       
      
    15 The land on which the offences were committed had been held in the Norvill family (“Norvill property”) until 1997. Adjoining the land was a property owned by Mr Teitzel (“Teitzel property”) and the former Terranora Lakes Country Club Golf Course (“Golf Course”).16 The Norvill property was owned by the Norvill family from 1908 to 20 November 1997. Until 1996, the Norvill property was run as a dairy farm. From 1930 to 1966, the property was also used for crops, such as beans, tomatoes, sugar cane and bananas. From 1966 the dairy cattle were crossbred with beef cattle. Beef cattle were grazed by the Norvill family until the sale of the property in 1997. The beef cattle were fenced off from the crop growing area. They commonly used fringes of vegetated parts of the property for shade.17 From the early 1970s until 1992, there was clearing of camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora) on the Norvill property at certain times of the year. However, large stands of camphor laurel remained. 
     
      
    18 Cropping ceased on the Norvill property some time after 1992. 
     
      
    19 On 20 November 1997, the Norvill property was sold to Terranora Group Management Pty Limited (“TGM”). One of the directors of that company was Mr Godfrey Mantle. TGM had purchased the Golf Course in 1996. 
     
      
    20 TGM applied for and obtained development consent in 1997 for a tourist resort on land that included parts of the Norvill property and the Golf Course. Subsequently, numerous applications were made to modify the development consent.  
     
      
    21 By about October 2005, TGM started preparation of a submission to the State Government under State Environmental Planning Policy (Major Projects) 2005 for a mixed residential development. The development was different in nature, design and footprint to the development that had been approved as a tourist resort in 1997. TGM’s submission, made in August 2006, described the development as “1,894 new dwellings and facilities … (being) a combination of private dwellings, retirement living, aged care, education, resort, health and fitness, arts, retail and restaurants, and public and protected open spaces.” 
     
      
    22 After TGM purchased the Norvill property in 1997, it ran cattle on the property, being cattle that had previously been run on the land by the Norvill family. 
     
      
    23 Prior to 2005, Mr Rawson had undertaken farm maintenance work on the Teitzel property. He had cut and poisoned vegetation such as camphor laurels and privets and cleared up the property to improve its grazing capacity. 
     
      
    24 In 2005, Mr Rawson met Mr Godfrey Mantle. Mr Mantle had seen the work Mr Rawson was doing on the Teitzel property and wanted Mr Rawson to clean up the Golf Course and Norvill property. 25 Mr Mantle wanted to run cattle on the Norvill property for his food and beverage business. One of Mr Mantle’s businesses was called “Jimmy’s on the Mall”, a Brisbane restaurant. Mr Mantle obtained advice about his proposals for cattle grazing on the property from Mr Rawson. Mr Rawson told Mr Mantle that he could clear five acres a year of regrowth scrub. Mr Rawson carried out fencing work on the Norvill property. He installed some cattle yards at the bottom of the property. Mr Rawson purchased some beef cattle for stocking on the property. Mr Mantle told Mr Rawson to clear the land to get the grass capacity up to run cattle. Mr Rawson estimated 90% of the property was to be brought up to a capacity for grazing cattle. 
     
      
    26 Mr Rawson agreed to work for Mr Mantle at a rate of $32.00 per hour, removing camphor laurels, privets and weeds and otherwise cleaning up the property. Mr Rawson said Mr Mantle wanted to put his own cattle on the property. Mr Rawson said he spoke with Mr Mantle about how good the property could be for cattle if the scrub were to be cleared up. 
     
      
    27 Mr Rawson said he commenced work on the Golf Course and cut and poisoned camphor laurels there. In late 2005, he started work on the Norvill property. Mr Rawson said that there were numerous weeds on the property because it had been neglected for forty years. These included camphor laurels and privets. 
     
      
    28 Mr Rawson said that there was so much work to do that he could not set a pattern. Sometimes he could work in one area, but a roaring southerly wind would hit so he would move to another area. Some of the areas were impenetrable. He would be scratched and sore from working in them on one day but the next day he decided that he would pick some easier work to do.  
     
      
    29 Mr Rawson used a chainsaw to cut the trees and weeds. For large trees, he said that he would cut pockets or notches around the trunk and put poison in the cuts. For smaller trees, he said he would cut the trunk off at or near ground level.  
     
      
    30 Mr Rawson invoiced TGM for work done on the Golf Course and the Norvill property. Mr Rawson’s invoices refer to work done on eradication of trees or camphor laurels between 22 February 2005 and 17 August 2006. The work done in 2005 was principally on the Golf Course whilst from late 2005 through 2006, the work done was on the Norvill property. 
     
      
    31 Mr Rawson did not contest the prosecutor’s evidence as to the total number of plants of each threatened species that had been picked on the Norvill property. Rather, Mr Rawson denied or did not admit picking specific plants, although he did admit picking hundreds of plants. Mr Rawson gave a variety of reasons for his denials or non-admissions of picking certain plants. However, each of Mr Rawson’s reasons was proven to be wrong in relation to many plants. Overall, I find Mr Rawson’s evidence as to his denials and non-admissions to be lacking in credibility and I do not accept it for a number of reasons. 
     
      
    32 First, Mr Rawson’s evidence, in his affidavits and his oral evidence on-site and in court, was consistent in maintaining that the purpose of his work on the Norvill property was to clear large areas of vegetation so as to improve the pasture and productivity of the Norvill property for cattle grazing.  
     
      
    33 In most of the areas in which Mr Rawson worked, Mr Rawson said he intended to remove all vegetation, except for a few trees for shade or aesthetic reasons, to convert the land to pasture for cattle grazing. He intended to, and understood Mr Mantle wanted him to, open up the property like the Teitzel property which was largely cleared. He estimated about 90% of the property was to be brought up to a capacity for cattle grazing. In other areas, such as either side of a creek flowing through the Norvill property, Mr Rawson stated he cut and poisoned vegetation to open up the canopy to let sunshine in and grass to grow or to allow better flow of underground water to the creek to provide drinking water for the stock, both being of benefit to improve the property for cattle grazing. At times, Mr Rawson said, he needed to clear a track to get to or to work on or around a tree, and this involved cutting vegetation. In relation to some trees, such as acacias, he said he removed them because they might in the future fall and damage fencing that he proposed to erect.  
     
      
    34 Mr Rawson admitted to working in each area on the Norvill property where threatened species were picked and admitted picking plants of threatened species in each area. In many instances, plants which Mr Rawson admitted picking were located immediately adjacent to or in near proximity to plants which he denied or did not admit cutting. 
     
      
    35 It would, therefore, be inconsistent with the purpose for which Mr Rawson was engaged to work on the Norvill property and his stated intention to clear vegetation on the property, and the actual work that he did, across the property, for Mr Rawson to have been the person who cut and poisoned only a quarter of the plants of the threatened species in the areas in which he worked but not to have been the person who cut and poisoned the other three quarters of plants of the threatened species in the very same areas, sometimes immediately adjacent to or otherwise in near proximity to plants which Mr Rawson admitted to having cut and poisoned. 
     
      
    36 Secondly, Mr Rawson’s non-admissions of picking hundreds of plants were solely based on the fact that Mr Rawson did not inspect those plants, whether because he could not find them or for other reasons. Hence, Mr Rawson never formed a positive opinion about those plants and was not in a position to deny picking them. 
     
      
    37 Thirdly, although Mr Rawson denied picking many plants in his affidavit evidence, when he later gave oral evidence on-site or in court, he admitted picking them. The most common explanation given by Mr Rawson for his change in evidence was that he had been mistaken as to the plant concerned when he prepared his affidavit evidence. In order to respond to the prosecutor’s list of plants that had been picked, Mr Rawson borrowed a GPS unit from an acquaintance. Mr Rawson had never used a GPS unit before and conceded that he found difficulty in using it and finding the plants at the GPS co-ordinates specified. He said he was unable to find many of the plants. It became clear at the on-site hearing, that plants that Mr Rawson thought he had found were in fact completely different plants. Although Mr Rawson had denied cutting certain plants, for differing reasons, on a number of occasions on the site hearing, upon seeing a plant Mr Rawson said he had not looked at that plant and must have been looking at a different plant when he prepared his affidavit. 
     
      
    38 For plants located on the Norvill property but towards the boundary of the Golf Course, Mr Rawson used the blanket reason of “on golf course” to justify his denial of picking the plants. On the site hearing, however, it became clear that Mr Rawson was not in fact denying that he cut those plants, but rather believed that he could not be held legally responsible if the plants were located on the Golf Course. Yet again, Mr Rawson was mistaken as to the location of the plants. They were in fact on the Norvill property, not on the Golf Course.  
     
      
    39 Mr Rawson also said that, given he had cut, poisoned or otherwise injured on his estimate 35,000 to 40,000 trees, shrubs or weeds on the Norvill property over an extended period, it was hard to be specific about a particular plant, “one little stick”. As Mr Rawson said in a record of interview in answer to a question whether he chopped down trees in an area, “I covered that much country out there, I don’t know”. 
     
      
    40 The consequence is that Mr Rawson’s denials or non-admissions in relation to specific plants were unreliable and cannot be accepted. 
     
      
    41 Fourthly, Mr Rawson denied cutting and poisoning many plants on the basis of the manner in which he observed the cutting and poisoning had been done. Mr Rawson’s denials were unconvincing. Types of cuts which Mr Rawson said he never used, such as v–shaped cut, or an angular cut or cutting high on a stem or trunk, in fact were shown to be used by Mr Rawson on trees and plants that he admitted cutting. Furthermore, the prosecutor’s evidence (from Allen Goodwin, William McDonald, Rhonda James and Scott Beaumont) established a consistency of cutting techniques employed in cutting and poisoning the plants. I do not accept Mr Rawson’s evidence that the cutting techniques used on the plants which Mr Rawson denied cutting were so different to the cutting techniques used on the plants which he admitted cutting that he could not have cut all of the plants. 
     
      
    42 Mr Rawson also expressed a proud belief in the efficacy of his work in cutting and poisoning plants. He denied cutting and poisoning certain plants on the basis that they were still alive, at least in part, when he inspected them in preparation of his affidavit. This may be because the plants had regrown underneath the cut or only part of the foliage had died from poisoning. Mr Rawson stated that anything he poisoned doesn’t grow back. This assertion too proved not to be correct. Mr Rawson later conceded that he had only a 90% success rate in killing trees and that there were a number of variables which could affect the success rate of killing a tree. Moreover, many of the large camphor laurel trees he admits to poisioning have suckered profusely from their extensive root systems, posing a threat to the recovery of native vegetation. Mr Rawson also stated that the complete removal of vegetation required reworking in an area. 
     
      
    43 Fifthly, Mr Rawson’s speculation that other persons may have cut and poisoned the plants he denied or did not admit cutting was unconvincing and without evidentiary foundation. Mr Rawson’s suggestions focussed on marijuana growers, surveyors, Robert Choat (who had milled some camphor laurel) or people who are opposed to TGM and its proposed development of the Golf Course and Norvill property. Mr Rawson said he never saw any of these persons cutting or poisoning plants on the property. Indeed, he said he never saw anyone else cutting plants, never heard a chainsaw operating elsewhere when he was working on the property and never saw any evidence of plants that had been cut and poisoned when he was working on the property. It is implausible that Mr Rawson, throughout the whole period he worked on the land, would not have seen persons cutting plants, or seen cut plants, if some other persons were in fact cutting the plants. 
     
      
    44 The only person Mr Rawson admitted to have ever been with him was a son of Mr Clark who was the manager of the Golf Course land employed by TGM. Although he initially denied his presence, upon being confronted with evidence from Messrs Colvin and McArthur (the ecologists for TGM) that they saw a person answering the description of one of Mr Clark’s sons with Mr Rawson, he conceded that the son had been present on a few occasions. However, Mr Rawson denied that the son ever did any of the cutting and poisoning. Whether this denial was the truth or intended to protect the son cannot be ascertained. Mr Rawson’s evidence remained, however, that only he, and not the son also, cut and poisoned the plants. On this basis, the son cannot be found to have cut the plants that Mr Rawson denied or did not admit cutting. 
     
      
    45 For these reasons, I find Mr Rawson cut, poisoned and otherwise injured the numbers of plants of the threatened species particularised by the prosecutor. 
     
      
       
      OBJECTIVE GRAVITY OF THE OFFENCES 
      
    46 The primary consideration in sentencing is the objective gravity or seriousness of each offence. The objective gravity fixes both the upper and lower limits of proportionate punishment. It fixes the upper limit because a sentence should never exceed that which can be justified as appropriate or proportional to the gravity of the crime considered in light of its objective circumstances. It fixes the lower limit because allowance for the subjective factors of the case, particularly of the offender, cannot produce a sentence which fails to reflect the objective gravity or seriousness of the offence: Gittany v Sutherland Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 242; (2006) 145 LGERA 189 at [108], [109] and cases therein cited. The objective circumstances of the offence and the purposes of punishment inform the lower limit of sentencing discretion, a bottom line beneath which a sentence cannot legitimately be set: SZ v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 19; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249 at [4]-[6] and Graham v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 212 at [43], [44]. 
     
      
    47 In assessing the objective gravity or seriousness of the offence, the sentencing court may have regard to not only the physical acts of the offender and their effects, as those acts or effects could be observed by a bystander, but also circumstances which are personal to the offender at the time of the offence which become objectively relevant because of their causal connection with the commission of the offence. These include the mental state of the offender and the reasons for committing the offence: see R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [85]-[86]. 
     
      
    48 In determining the objective gravity or seriousness of each of the offences in this case, the circumstances to which the Court may have regard include: 
     
      
       
        
       
      (a) the nature of the offences; 
       
      (b) the maximum penalties for the offences; 
       
      (c) the harm caused to the environment by commission of the offences; 
       
      (d) the state of mind of the offender in committing the offences; 
       
      (e) the offender’s reasons for committing the offences; 
       
      (f) the foreseeable risk of harm to the environment by commission of the offences; 
       
      (g) the practical measures to avoid harm to the environment; and 
       
      (h) the offender’s control over the causes of harm to the environment. 
      
     
     
      
      Nature of offences 
      
    49 A fundamental consideration of relevance to environmental offences is the degree by which, having regard to the maximum penalties provided by the statute in question, the offender’s conduct would offend against the legislative objectives expressed in the statutory offence: R v Peel [1971] 1 NSWLR 247 at 262; Garrett v Williams [2006] NSWLEC 785; (2006) 160 LGERA 115 at [89]; Garrett v Freeman (No 5); Garrett v Port Macquarie Hastings Council; Carter v Port Macquarie Hastings Council [2009] NSWLEC 1; (2009) 164 LGERA 287 at [52]; Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Rae [2009] NSWLEC 137 at [15]. 
     
      
    50 The nature and legislative objective of the offence provision, s 118A of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974, and the statutory scheme, were considered in Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLEC 34; (2006) 145 LGERA 234 at [51]-[71], [168] and [169]; Garrett v Williams at [90]; and Garrett v Freeman (No 5) at [52], [58]-[61]. I adopt the discussion in those cases. 
     
      
    51 The objects of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 are stated in s 2A to include: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The conservation of nature, including, but not limited to, the conservation of: 
        
       
       
        
        (i) habitat, ecosystems and ecosystem processes; and 
         
        (ii) biological diversity at the community, species and genetic levels, …” (s 2A(1)(a)). 
        
       
      
    52 These objects are to be achieved by applying the principles of ecologically sustainable development: s 2A(2). The “principles of ecologically sustainable development” are defined to be those described in s 6(2) of the Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991 (NSW). These principles are described as involving the four principles of: the precautionary principle; inter-generational equity; conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity; and improved valuation, pricing and incentive mechanisms. 
     
      
    53 The offence provision of s 118A(2) was introduced into the National Parks and Wildlife Act by the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. The Threatened Species Conservation Act, as its long title pronounces, is “an Act to conserve threatened species, populations and ecological communities of animals and plants”. The objects of the Threatened Species Conservation Act are stated in s 3 to include: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) to conserve biological diversity and promote ecologically sustainable development, and 
         
        (b) to prevent the extinction and promote the recovery of threatened species, populations and ecological communities, and 
         
        (c) to protect the critical habitat of those threatened species, populations and ecological communities that are endangered, and 
         
        (d) to eliminate or manage certain processes that threaten the survival or evolutionary development of threatened species, populations and ecological communities, and 
         
        (e) to ensure that the impact of any action affecting threatened species, populations and ecological communities is properly assessed, and 
         
        (f) to encourage the conservation of threatened species, populations and ecological communities by the adoption of measures involving co-operative management.” 
        
       
      
    54 One of the principal means by which these statutory objectives for conservation of biological diversity generally and threatened species, populations and ecological communities in particular, are to be achieved is by the statute prohibiting damaging conduct but enabling a person to be relieved of the prohibition by applying for and obtaining statutory approval from a competent regulatory authority. Application for approval involves undertaking environmental impact assessment of the proposed damaging conduct. The statutory provisions requiring prior environmental impact assessment and approval are linchpins of the statutory scheme. An offence against such provisions thwarts the achievement of the objects of the National Parks and Wildlife Act and the Threatened Species Conservation Act, including ecologically sustainable development: see Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd at [65]-[71], [168], [169]. 
     
      
    55 There is a need for the upholding of the regulatory system under the National Parks and Wildlife Act. The system depends on persons, first, taking steps to ascertain when approval is required to damage threatened species, populations or ecological communities, secondly, making application in the appropriate form and manner (including an environmental impact assessment) and obtaining any approval required before undertaking the damaging conduct and, thirdly, complying with the terms and conditions of the approval in undertaking the damaging conduct. Sentencing courts have emphasised the need to uphold the integrity of the regulatory scheme relating to the conservation of biological diversity and threatened species, populations and ecological communities: see Bentley v BGP Properties at [65]; Garrett v Freeman (No 5) at [58]; and Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Rae at [18]. Offences which undermine the integrity of the regulatory system are objectively serious. 
     
      
    56 The actions of Mr Rawson in picking plants of threatened species without first applying for, then obtaining approval under the National Parks and Wildlife Act, offended against the legislative objectives expressed in the statutory offence and thwarted the achievement of the objects of the Act, including ecologically sustainable development. As found below, the plants were not only of a threatened species but also were components of, first, populations of those species of significant conservational status and, secondly, a listed endangered ecological community. Mr Rawson’s conduct has caused a high degree of environmental harm. 
     
      
       
      Maximum penalty 
       
      
    57 The maximum penalty for the offence is of great relevance in determining the objective gravity of the offence. The maximum penalty reflects the public expression by Parliament of the seriousness of the offence: see Camilleri’s Stock Feeds Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 32 NSWLR 683 at 698; 82 LGERA 21 at 36. It also provides a sentencing yardstick for the case before the court. As the High Court noted in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [31]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It follows that careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required, first because the legislature has legislated for them; secondly, because they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court at the time; and thirdly, because in that regard they do provide, taken and balanced with all of the other relevant factors, a yardstick.” 
        
       
      
    58 The maximum penalty prescribed for an offence against s 118A(2) varies depending upon whether the plant picked is an endangered species or a vulnerable species. For the three offences involving endangered species (50077, 50079 and 50082 of 2007), the maximum penalty is 2,000 penalty units ($220,000) or imprisonment for 2 years or both, and an additional 100 penalty units ($11,000) in respect of each whole plant that was affected by or concerned in the action that constituted the offence.  
     
      
    59 For the four offences in respect of vulnerable species (50078, 50080, 50081 and 50083 of 2007), the maximum penalty is 500 penalty units ($55,000) or imprisonment for 1 year or both, and an additional 50 penalty units ($5,500) in respect of each whole plant that was affected by or concerned in the action that constituted the offence. 
     
      
    60 These penalties for offences in respect of an endangered species and a vulnerable species reveal the seriousness with which Parliament views such offences. Three aspects can be noted.  
     
      
    61 First, the maximum penalties for an offence in respect of any endangered species, population or ecological community are greater than the maximum penalties for a vulnerable species. This shows that Parliament views an offence in respect of any endangered species, population or ecological community as being proportionately more serious than an offence in respect of a vulnerable species. 
     
      
    62 Secondly, Parliament has prescribed an additional penalty per whole plant that was affected by or concerned in the action that constituted the offence. The prescription by Parliament of an additional penalty is intended to enable the total penalty to be proportionate to the extent of harm caused by the actions constituting the offence. By prescribing an additional penalty, Parliament has expressed that the objective gravity or seriousness of the offence increases with the number of whole plants affected by or concerned in the action constituting the offence: Garrett v Williams at [94]. 
     
      
    63 The prescription of an additional penalty for each whole plant may also be recognition by Parliament of the value of each individual plant comprising a threatened species, population or ecological community. Species, populations and ecological communities can only be listed as threatened if they face a high risk of extinction: see Division 2 of Part 2 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act. One reason may be that the number of individuals comprising the listed threatened species, population or ecological community have fallen to critically low levels. The loss of each individual whole plant of a threatened species, population or ecological community, contributes to the threats to the survival of the listed threatened species, population or ecological community. 
     
      
    64 Thirdly, the seriousness of the offence against s 118A(2) is also emphasised by the availability of a sentence of imprisonment for up to two years for an offence in respect of an endangered species, population or ecological community, or one year for an offence in respect of a vulnerable species, either by itself or in addition to a fine. 
     
      
    65 For the offences committed by Mr Rawson, the potential maximum monetary penalties are very high as a result of the additional penalties for the numbers of whole plants affected by the conduct that constituted each offence. For the offences involving endangered species, the potential maximum monetary penalties are: 
     
      
     
     
      
       
       Charge 
       Endangered species 
       Number of plants 
       Potential max. penalty 
       
       
       50077/07 
       Gossia fragrantissima 
       22 
       $462,000 ($220,000 + $11,000 x 22)  
       
       
       50079/09 
       Grevillea hilliana 
       17 
       $407,000 ($220,000 + $11,000 x 17) 
       
       
       50082/07 
       Randia moorei 
       134 
       $1,694,000 ($220,000 + $11,000 x 134) 
       
      
     
     
      
    66 For the offences involving vulnerable species, the potential maximum penalties are: 
     
      
     
     
      
       
       Charge 
       Vulnerable species 
       Number of plants 
       Potential max. penalty 
       
       
       50078/07 
       Hicksbeachia pinnatifolia 
       22 
       $176,000 ($55,000 + $5,500 x 22) 
       
       
       50080/07 
       Macadamia tetraphylla 
       492 
       $2,761,000 ($55,000 + $5,500 x 492) 
       
       
       50081/07 
       Lepiderema pulchella 
       560 
       $3,135,000 ($55,000 + $5,500 x 560) 
       
       
       50083/07 
       Acacia bakeri 
       32 
       $231,000 ($55,000 + $5,500 x 32) 
       
      
     
     
      
    67 These high maximum penalties reflect the seriousness with which Parliament views the offence of picking threatened species of plants. 
     
      
      Harm to the environment 
      
    68 The objective seriousness of the offence is affected by the objective harmfulness of the offender’s actions. The causing of “substantial” injury, loss or damage by commission of the offence is an aggravating factor: s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Harmfulness in the context of the commission of an offence against s 118A(2) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act involves the adverse impacts on the threatened species, populations or endangered ecological communities, and their habitats, and ecological processes and functioning. 
     
      
    69 The prosecutor led evidence of harm to the environment caused by commission of the offences from Dr McDonald.  
     
      
       
      Biodiversity and other conservation values of the vegetation communities 
       
      
    70 There are two forest types on the Norvill property, a high quality rainforest remnant and secondary vegetation. The rainforest remnant is located at the south of the Norvill property, including near the road that enters the south east of the property from the Golf Course. The secondary vegetation is the vegetation on the property that is not part of the rainforest remnant.  
     
      
    71 The rainforest remnant represents a drier form of the Argyrodendron trifoliatum suballiance found between Tamborine Mountain (in south east Queensland) and Brunswick Heads (on the NSW far north coast). 
     
      
    72 The rainforest remnant meets the description of the endangered ecological community of Lowland Rainforest in NSW North Coast and Sydney Basin Bioregion, listed under the Threatened Species Conservation Act. 
     
      
    73 The rainforest remnant, along with another rainforest remnant in Nicoll Scrub National Park in Queensland, is amongst the richest rainforest stands within the Border Ranges/Big Scrub region based on the total species diversity present, as well as the observed species diversity of the canopy. 175 native plant species have been recorded for the Norvill property. 41 species for the Norvill property have been identified as State or regional significance, including the endangered and vulnerable species the subject of the offences. Other species comprise geographically restricted species and more widely distributed species which were at or close to their geographical limits. Species that are at the limits of their geographical range are, for that reason, additionally significant. 
     
      
    74 A common feature of the Norvill property and the Nicoll Scrub National Park is the underlying geology, namely Tertiary basalt overlying Palaeozoic metasediments. This gives rise to a mix of soil textures and levels of nutrients which support a more diverse species assemblage than those occurring on either the basalt or metasediments alone.  
     
      
    75 The fact that the rainforest remnant has been disturbed over the years, involves some regrowth and has been infiltrated by some exotic species, does not remove its biodiversity and conservation values. 
     
      
    76 The secondary vegetation on the Norvill property is dominated by camphor laurel and privet, but still has a significant component of native rainforest species. The secondary vegetation areas contain populations of Macadamia tetraphylla and Lepiderema pulchella which are significant both in terms of their numbers and range of size classes. 
     
      
       
      Biodiversity and other conservation values of the threatened species picked 
       
      
    77 Each of the populations of the seven threatened species of plants picked were of specific importance.  
     
      
    78 The pre-damage population of Macadamia tetraphylla on the Norvill property was one of the largest, if not the largest, remaining population of this vulnerable species. A larger population of Macadamia tetraphylla elsewhere is not known. The population of Macadamia tetraphylla on the Norvill property was a key population for maintaining genetic diversity. It was the most northerly population which does not overlap (and presumably interbreed) with wild populations of Macadamia integrifolia. However, the genetic integrity of this population may, like others, have been compromised to some unknown extent by the establishment of commercial macadamia plantations in the vicinity. 
     
      
    79 The pre-damage population of Randia moorei on the Norvill property was estimated to be at least 200 plants. This would make it the largest population in NSW, ahead of that at Brunswick Heads (68 individuals), and exceeded only by a recently discovered population in Queensland adjacent to Lake Advancetown, south of Nerang. There was, and remains, a range of size classes in the population. 
     
      
    80 Lepiderema pulchella is not a widespread or abundant species. It occurs, sparingly, in eastern Lamington National Park and in parts of the Springbrook foothills (in Queensland) where it can be a relevantly frequent species. The population of Lepiderema pulchella at the Norvill property is significant in terms of other known areas, in terms of sizes of individual trees and in terms of the actual number of trees. It was a well developed population that would certainly have been important for genetic diversity on the property itself as well as for interactions with other remnants in the general vicinity. 
     
      
    81 Having regard to the presence of several very large trees, the population of Acacia bakeri on the Norvill property was part of a well established population, which is quite rare in NSW. Some of the trees observed as damaged, based on diameter basal height, would be in the vicinity of 100 to 200 years old. 
     
      
    82 Hicksbeachia pinnatifolia, Gossia frangrantissima and Grevillea hilliana are significant to the forest communities at the Norvill property in that they provide a further component adding to species diversity. Grevillea hilliana is at or close to the southern limits of its geographical range, and for this reason its occurrence on the Norvill property is of increased significance. 
     
      
       
      Actual harm to threatened species 
       
      
    83 Most of the plants that have been cut and poisoned have died or are likely to die. Those that have resprouted may or may not continue to grow and thrive. Dr McDonald assessed the harm to each of the threatened species caused by Mr Rawson’s conduct. 
     
      
    84 Other than actual harm to the individual Gossia frangrantissima trees, there is no special harm to the forest community by the loss of these trees. Although the geographical range of this species is very restricted, the population of the species should remain viable provided there is protection of trees on the Norvill property in the future. 
     
      
    85 The loss of the Grevillea hilliana individuals is a most significant loss for the local population of that species, especially given that its occurrence on the Norvill property is very close to the southern limit of its range. 
     
      
    86 The number of Randia moorei plants damaged (134) is significant. This is greater than the Brunswick Heads population (60 individuals) previously considered the largest single occurrence of this species. Over one half of the estimated total population of Randia moorei  in the Norvill property was damaged by Mr Rawson’s conduct. The species occurs within two areas of the remnant rainforest. In one area individuals of the species mostly remain undamaged, but on the eastern side of the remnant individuals have been largely destroyed and connectivity within the rainforest habitat has been heavily compromised. The damage will adversely affect plant-pollinator relationships and disrupt the lifecycle of the species. The damage and disturbance of the site has had a significant adverse impact and this impact is likely to be long lasting and difficult to reverse unless extensive rehabilitation of the rainforest habitat is undertaken and active species recovery plans are implemented. 
     
      
    87 Notwithstanding the loss of the Acacia bakeri individuals, the population of the species on the Norvill property, given protection and the appropriate management of the future, will recover. However it will take a long time to do so. Some of the individual trees may have been 100 to 200 years old. The impact of the local population is exacerbated because some of the trees killed were large and of reproductive age.  
     
      
    88 Apart from the actual harm to the Hicksbeachia pinnatifolia individuals themselves, the damage will not have a significant impact on the local population, given there are larger specimens of the species in the vicinity.  
     
      
    89 Although a large number of individuals of Lepiderema pulchella on the Norvill property were damaged (560), the population on the property is sizeable. Approximately 10% of the damaged individuals have resprouted. Most if not all of these should survive and recover. There is an unknown but substantial amount of small individuals in the regrowth vegetation which were not damaged. There are also a significant number of individuals in a range of size classes in the remnant rainforest. The total number of living individuals at the site is at least as large as the number destroyed, and as the seed is readily dispersed, this population should re-establish itself to former levels in a relatively short time, given appropriate management.  
     
      
    90 A large number of individuals of Macadamia tetraphylla (492) were damaged. Approximately 75% of the total estimated population of the Norvill property appears to have been destroyed. The damage to this population will impact on the breeding cycle of the species and its associated pollinators. The destruction of the major proportion of this population as well as its habitat has had a severe and long term impact upon the recovery of the species.  
     
      
       
      Loss of connectivity 
      
    91 In addition to actual harm to individual trees and shrubs of the endangered and vulnerable species, connectivity within the remnant has been severely compromised by treatment of all trees and shrubs in the strip adjacent to the southern access road to the site and the large numbers of trees treated on a face along the northern margin of the main remnant.  
     
      
    92 The loss of connectivity has caused actual environmental harm, most particularly to Randia moorei, and other understorey trees, by creating a barrier to pollination and dispersal. Gaps created may be filled by secondary tree species within a period of about 20 years. It will take much longer for mature phase tree species to reach the canopy. 
     
      
    93 Apart from the damage inflicted on individual plants, the threatened species have also been adversely affected by changes to their habitat resulting from the death of surrounding canopy and sub-canopy trees, both within the remnant rainforest and secondary vegetation. The increased temperature and light regimes caused by the damage have encouraged the germination and growth of large numbers of camphor laurel and privet seedlings as well as numerous other weed species. These fast growing weed species compete with and may exclude, threatened and other native rainforest tree and shrub species attempting to re-establish in these areas.  
     
      
       
      Recovery of vegetation 
       
      
    94 In relation to the remnant rainforest, a return to mature rainforest structure and composition may take hundreds of years. This process would probably span two or three generations of mature species or more than 800 years. In relation to secondary vegetation, it would take at least 20 years for it to recover to its predamaged state. 
     
      
    95 In relation to Macadamia tetraphylla, as the species is relatively poorly dispersed, relying on gravity and movement by small mammals, such as native rodents, it is extremely unlikely that the population on the Norvill property will recover in the short to medium term. The damage to the Macadamia tetraphylla population will take some decades of recovery for it to achieve the degree of structural and floristic development evident in adjacent untreated areas. The majority of larger individuals (those producing fruit) are dead. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion on environmental harm 
       
      
    96 Picking of the threatened species has caused actual environmental harm of a high level of significance. It constitutes injury, loss or damage that is substantial and an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
       
      State of mind of offender 
       
      
    97 The offence against s 118A(2) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act is a strict liability offence and mens rea is not an element of the offence. A person does not need to know that the plant concerned is of, or is part of a threatened species, an endangered population or an endangered ecological community, to commit an offence against s 118A(2). This offence stands in contrast to the offence against s 118D(1) of damaging habitat of a threatened species, endangered population or endangered ecological community, where an element of the offence is that the person “knows that the land concerned is habitat of that kind.”98 Nevertheless, the state of mind of a person at the time of committing an offence against s 118A(2) can have the effect of increasing the objective seriousness of the offence. A strict liability offence that is committed intentionally, negligently or recklessly will be objectively more serious than one not so committed: Gittany Constructions Pty Ltd v Sutherland Shire Council at [123]; Hardt v Environment Protection Authority [2007] NSWCCA 338; (2007) 156 LGERA 337 at [53]; Garrett v Freeman (No 5) at [68], [356]; Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Rae at [42], [46]. Offences committed deliberately are more serious than offences committed due to inadvertence or error: Garrett v Williams at [103] and Garrett v Freeman (No 5) at [68]. 
     
      
    99 A failure to heed advice or warnings, including from regulatory authorities, will be an aggravating feature: R & F Howe and Son (Engineers) Ltd [1999] 2 All ER 249; [1999] 2 Cr App Rep (S) 37 at [43]; R v Yorkshire Water Services Ltd  [2002] 2 Cr App R (S) 13 at [17]; R v Bata Industries Ltd (1992) 9 OR (3d) 329 at [192]; Garrett v Williams at [110], [111]. 
     
      
    100 I find, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Rawson deliberately cut and poisoned the plants the subject of the offences. I do not find, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Rawson knew, before he cut and poisoned each plant, that it was a threatened species or protected by law. However, I do find, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Rawson received information and advice that some plants he had cut might have been threatened species and their removal might have been contrary to law, and Mr Rawson acted in reckless disregard of this information and advice in cutting and poisoning other plants. There are five reasons for my finding that Mr Rawson did not know that the plants he cut and poisoned were protected threatened species or protected by law, before he cut and poisoned them. 
     
      
    101 First, I accept Mr Rawson’s evidence as to his lack of knowledge about each of the threatened species. I will deal with each species. 
     
      
    102 Mr Rawson says he knew the “nice, harmless tree” of Hicksbeachia pinnatifolia, which he knew as a Bopple Nut, and that those trees were rare in occurrence. However, he did not know that they were listed as a threatened species or protected by law. Mr Rawson said that, from his recollection, he did not cut any Bopple Nuts. However, he pleaded guilty to the offence in proceedings 50078/07 which involved picking Hicksbeachia pinnatifolia. He also later admitted to cutting two Bopple Nut plants. He denied cutting the additional twenty Bopple Nut plants observed by Mr Colvin on 27 February 2006 as having been cut. I find, beyond reasonable doubt, that he did cut the additional plants for the reasons I have given earlier for finding Mr Rawson picked all of the plants particularised in the offences. However, I find that Mr Rawson did not know at the time he cut them that they were Bopple Nuts. Mr Rawson conceded in oral evidence that it was possible that if he was working in scrub and did not look up, he may not have noticed that the tree was a Bopple Nut. 
     
      
    103 Mr Rawson did not know the tree of the species Acacia bakeri. The trees that he cut down, which were in fact Acacia bakeri, he thought were another species, which he called a Sally Wattle, and which he considered to be “a common native pest on farmland”. Hence, he did not know the trees were a threatened species or protected by law. 
     
      
    104 Mr Rawson said he did not know the plant Randia moorei and he did not know it was a threatened species or protected by law. Mr Rawson said that he had seen Lepiderema pulchella, which he knew as a Tuckeroo, as there were “hundreds and hundreds” of them on the Norvill property. He said that they were “everywhere”. He did not know that they were a threatened species or protected by law. 
     
      
    105 Mr Rawson knew Macadamia trees, he called them “Macas”, but he was unable to distinguish between Macadamia tetraphylla, the threatened species that occurred on the Norvill property, and the more commonly cultivated Macadamia integrifolia. Mr Rawson considered that Macadamias grew everywhere. He did not know that they were a threatened species or protected by law. 
     
      
    106 Mr Rawson did not know the plant Gossia fragrantissima or that it was a threatened species or protected by law. Mr Rawson could identify the tree that is Grevillea hilliana and could distinguish it from a Sally Wattle. However, he did not know its name, or that it was a threatened species or protected by law. 
     
      
    107 Secondly, I accept Mr Rawson’s evidence as to his lack of knowledge of threatened species generally. Mr Rawson said that he knew some plants were protected by the law but did not know which ones they were. He said he did not think that there was any law against cleaning up an old farm. He said: “Clearing up old farms, I didn’t think it really mattered that much as long as you did it strategically here and there, as long as you didn’t wipe the whole thing right out off the face of the map, you leave the strategic trees and the strategic little gulleys as I did on the Teitzel property, as I did on the three other ones there”. 
     
      
    108 Thirdly, I accept Mr Rawson’s evidence that he never had a conversation with Mr Mantle or anyone else from TGM about threatened species on the Norvill property or about Mr Rawson cutting down or damaging threatened species on the property. 
     
      
    109 Fourthly, I do not find, beyond reasonable doubt, that when Mr Rawson cut and poisoned plants previously tagged by the ecologists as being threatened species, he knew that the plants were threatened species or knew the significance of the plants being tagged. Mr Rawson said that he did see tags, including pink tags, “everywhere, on camphors, lantana, fence posts, surveyors’ pegs and the ground. They were here, there and everywhere.” He was not told of the reason for, or the significance of, the tags. He admits to cutting some trees or shrubs with pink tags, but he said he “didn’t deliberately go and target the trees with the pink ribbons on them.” He cut and poisoned them, along with the untagged plants if they were in an area that he intended to clear. Mr Rawson also pointed out that many plants with pink tape are still growing today on the Norvill property and have not been cut or poisoned. Mr Rawson made this point to rebut the suggestion that he targeted plants with pink tape for cutting and poisoning. 
     
      
    110 Fifthly, I do not find that because Mr Rawson had a map of the Norvill property that he had knowledge of the location of the threatened species on that property. Mr Rawson admitted to having a map of the Norvill property given to him by Mr Clark. Mr Rawson said that he obtained the map to see where the boundaries of the Norvill property were, particularly in the south, so that he would undertake work only on the property. There was a dispute between Mr Colvin and McArthur, on the one hand, and Mr Rawson on the other hand, as to whether the map Mr Rawson had in his possession on 23 May 2006 had dots on it depicting the location of threatened species. The map Mr Rawson had on that day is no longer available. Mr Colvin and Mr McArthur identified a map similar to the map they said they saw in the back of Mr Rawson’s red utility. This similar map was an aerial photograph of the Norvill property and surrounding properties. Superimposed on the aerial photograph were the cadastral boundaries and title references. There were also small yellow dots distributed in vegetated areas on the Norvill property. The legend described the yellow dots as “Threatened plant”. The map did not identify any species of threatened plant. 111 I find, beyond reasonable doubt, that the map Mr Rawson had in his red utility was one similar to the map described by Mr Colvin and Mr McArthur. However, I do not find that Mr Rawson was given or obtained this map for the purpose of finding the location of threatened species. I accept Mr Rawson’s evidence that he was given or obtained the map for the purpose of showing where the boundaries of the Norvill property were located in relation to the vegetation and other features shown on the aerial photograph.  
     
      
    112 I also do not find, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Rawson used the map to find the location of threatened species on the property. Mr Rawson denies doing so. There is no other direct evidence of his having done so. Indeed, the nature of the map as an aerial photograph, the scale of the map, the size of the map and the dots and the absence of any identification of the species of the threatened plants would make use of the map to find any particular threatened species difficult. It would be particularly difficult for Mr Rawson. Mr Rawson said, on a number of occasions in his evidence, that he had difficulty reading and working from maps. Rather, his practice was to work in the field without a map. Mr Rawson also needs glasses to read but said he did not wear his glasses when he worked so he could not have read a map with dots on it.  
     
      
    113 Accordingly, I do not find from the fact that Mr Rawson had a map which had dots depicting the location of threatened species, that Mr Rawson knew that the plants he cut and poisoned were threatened species. 114 However, I do find, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Rawson received information and advice that trees he had cut might have been threatened species and that removal of vegetation might be contrary to the law. 
     
      
    115 Mr Rawson had conversations with Mr Colvin, one of the ecologists working with James Warren & Associates identifying and tagging threatened species on the Norvill property, on 27 February 2006 and on 23 May 2006. Mr Colvin said that on 27 February 2006 he observed twenty cut Hicksbeachia pinnatifolia (Red Bopple Nut) trees and then had the following conversation with Mr Rawson: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Colvin said: ‘Why the hell have you cut down all these trees?’ 
         
         
        The defendant said: ‘Godfrey’s orders. Just doing what I’m told to do.’ 
         
         
        Mr Colvin said: ‘Why are you doing it?’ 
         
         
        The defendant said: ‘I am just doing what I am told to do.’ 
         
         
        Mr Colvin said: ‘Are you going to keep on cutting the trees down? These are threatened trees, you can’t cut them down.’” 
        
       
      
    116 Mr Colvin said Mr Rawson did not respond to Mr Rawson’s last question. Mr Rawson did not remember the terms of the conversation with Mr Colvin. He admits Mr Colvin was angry with him and accused him of having killed Bopple Nuts.  
     
      
    117 I find the conversation on 27 February 2006 occurred in terms of Mr Colvin’s account. This means that Mr Rawson was alerted to the fact that the Bopple Nut trees that had been cut were, in the opinion of Mr Colvin, threatened trees. However, there is no evidence that any more Bopple Nut trees were cut and poisoned by Mr Rawson. All of the Hicksbeachia pinnatifolia (Bopple Nut) trees that were cut and poisoned were in the same area. There is no evidence that the additional two Bopple Nut trees were cut and poisoned after the twenty cut trees that Mr Colvin observed and which were the subject of the conservation with Mr Rawson on 27 February 2006. 
     
      
    118 Nevertheless, Mr Rawson had been alerted by Mr Colvin to the fact that certain plants that had been cut were said to be threatened plants. This ought reasonably to have alerted Mr Rawson to the possibility that other plants on the property might be threatened plants. 
     
      
    119 Mr Colvin had another conversation with Mr Rawson, at a different location on the property, on 23 May 2006. Mr Colvin’s account is: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Colvin said: ‘What further work have you done here?’ 
         
         
        The defendant said: ‘I’ve poisoned a lot of vegetation around this area.’ 
         
         
        Mr Colvin said: ‘You are not going to cut down any more threatened species are you?’” 
        
       
      
    120 Mr Colvin said Mr Rawson did not reply to the last question but produced the map he had in the back of the red utility. The conversation continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Colvin said: ‘How much more are you going to do?’ 
         
         
        The defendant said: ‘I have finished now. I have just been in the process of removing vegetation from around here.’” 
        
       
      
     Mr Rawson then indicated a finger of vegetation into a paddock. 
     
      
       
        
        “The defendant said: ‘I am just going to do the top bit here.’” 
        
       
        
      
    121 Mr Rawson did not remember the terms of the conversation. 
     
      
    122 Again, I find the conversation on 23 May 2006 occurred in terms of Mr Colvin’s account. This conversation did not inform Mr Rawson that the remaining vegetation he said he intended to remove contained threatened species. However, Mr Rawson may have been alerted from Mr Colvin’s question that Mr Colvin considered that vegetation Mr Rawson had previously cut on the property contained threatened species.  
     
      
    123 There was also a conversation Mr Rawson had at the Norvill property on 8 March 2006 with an officer of Tweed Shire Council, Mr Bishop. Mr Bishop saw a number of trees had been cut and were dying and saw Mr Rawson cutting a tree with a chainsaw. Mr Bishop says the conversation was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Bishop said: ‘Why are you cutting and poisoning trees?’ 
         
         
        The defendant said: ‘What’s the problem? They’re only camphor laurel and privet trees which are noxious.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Bishop said: ‘No, it’s a 7(d) Environment Protection Zone where the scenic qualities should be preserved. Also, the area is covered by a Tree Preservation Order where removal of any vegetation requires approval. Who authorised this work and how long have you been doing it?’ 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant said: ‘The owner contracted me. I’ve been working here for months.’ 
         
         
        Mr Bishop said: ‘You mean Godfrey Mantle?’ 
         
         
        The defendant said: ‘Yes.’ 
         
         
        Mr Bishop said: ‘I will contact him. In the meantime I’ll have to ask you to stop work.’ 
         
         
        The defendant said: ‘OK.’” 
        
       
       
      Mr Rawson does not recall the terms of the conversation but does recall being told to stop work and doing so. I find, beyond reasonable doubt, that the conversation occurred as stated by Mr Bishop. 
       
      
    124 The effect of these conversations is that Mr Rawson was alerted to the fact that his actions of cutting and poisoning trees on the Norvill property might be affecting threatened plants and might be contrary to the law. However, Mr Rawson did not make any inquiry about what he had been told by Mr Colvin or Mr Bishop, or what plants were threatened plants or what was the significance of plants being threatened plants, or whether the clearing of vegetation, including camphor laurels and privets, on the property was contrary to law. In continuing to cut and poison vegetation on the land, after being so alerted but making no inquiries, Mr Rawson exhibited a reckless disregard to whether his actions were lawful or not.125 I find, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Rawson’s actions constituting each of the offences were deliberate and that Mr Rawson acted in reckless disregard of the information, advice and warnings of Mr Colvin (that at least some of the plants that Mr Rawson had cut and poisoned were threatened species) and of Mr Bishop (that the cutting and poisoning of plants on the property may be contrary to the law). However, I do not find, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Rawson knew, before he cut and poisoned the plants that were threatened species, that they were threatened species and protected by the law. 
     
      
       
      Reasons for committing the offence 
       
      
    126 The criminality involved in the commission of an offence is to be measured not only by the seriousness of what occurred but also by reference to the reasons for its occurrence: see Garrett v Williams at [120] and cases therein cited. 
     
      
    127 The prosecutor submits that Mr Rawson deliberately targeted threatened species of plants growing in the location of the footprint of the mixed residential development proposed by TGM. The prosecutor submitted that Mr Rawson, at the request and direction of TGM, cut and poisoned the threatened species of plants as they were impediments or constraints to the prospects of obtaining all necessary approvals for that proposed development. The prosecutor submitted that such a purpose for committing the offence increases the objective seriousness of the offences. 
     
      
    128 Mr Rawson denied that this was his purpose in committing the offences. Mr Rawson steadfastly claimed that he cut and poisoned the plants that were the threatened species, as well as the tens of thousands of other plants including weeds on the property, for the purpose of cleaning up the Norvill property to improve its pasture and productivity for cattle grazing. This was the purpose for which he was engaged by Mr Mantle of TGM. Mr Rawson said that he never knew, until after he had finished his work on the Norvill property, of TGM’s specific development proposal for the property or of the location of the footprint of that development proposal and its relationship to the location of threatened species of plants on the property. He had only heard indirectly of vague rumours of proposals to develop the property, but no one spoke to him directly or briefed him about TGM’s specific development proposal. Mr Rawson denied targeting threatened species for removal. 
     
      
    129 The prosecutor has not established, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Rawson committed each of the offences for the purpose of removing impediments to the proposed mixed residential development of his principal, TGM. Rather, I find beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Rawson committed the offence for the purpose of improving the pasture and productivity of the Norvill property for cattle grazing. There are three reasons for these findings. 
     
      
    130 First, there is no direct evidence that Mr Rawson was ever informed of TGM’s development proposal for the Norvill property, or briefed as to where it would be located on the property, or shown where it might conflict with any threatened species that might occur on the property. The prosecutor, or for that matter, the defendant, did not call evidence from any person from TGM, including Mr Mantle or Mr Clark. The prosecutor did lead evidence from Mr Colvin and Mr McArthur, the ecologists from James Warren & Associates engaged by TGM to undertake flora surveys on the Norvill property. However, they did not say that they had ever shown Mr Rawson where threatened species of plants were located on the Norvill property, or even what plants were threatened species, where the footprint of the proposed development was to be located or where it might conflict with the location of threatened species on the Norvill property. They did say that they saw, on 23 May 2006, Mr Rawson with a copy of a map produced by James Warren & Associates with dots on it, depicting the location of threatened species.  
     
      
    131 However, the mere fact that Mr Rawson had a map in the back of his utility, by itself, is equivocal as to how Mr Rawson used the map. Mr Rawson says he was given the map by Mr Clark in order to assist Mr Rawson in finding the location of the southern boundary of the property. Mr Rawson said he did not use the map to find the location of threatened species. Mr Colvin and Mr McArthur did not say that they saw Mr Rawson using the map to find threatened species or that Mr Rawson admitted to them that he had used the map for that purpose.  
     
      
    132 Mr Rawson’s evidence was consistent in denying knowledge of TGM’s development proposal for the Norvill property. He said that he never had any discussions with Mr Mantle or Mr Clark of TGM about any development proposal for the Norvill property and, hence, he could never have discussed whether any development proposal might conflict with any threatened species on the Norvill property. Mr Rawson said the only discussions he had with Mr Mantle were about cleaning up the property for the purpose of improving it for cattle grazing. 
     
      
    133 Secondly, the indirect or circumstantial evidence does not establish that Mr Rawson’s actions constituting the offences were done for the purpose of removing impediments for TGM’s proposed development. The prosecutor’s overlays of the footprint of TGM’s proposed development, particularly the location of the roads, with the location of the threatened plant species cut and poisoned by Mr Rawson does not establish any clear pattern. Although there are areas of overlap, there are also considerable areas where there is no overlap. Certainly, it cannot be found that the degree of overlap between TGM’s development proposal and the location of threatened plant species cut and poisoned by Mr Rawson, is any greater than would be the case if an overlay had been prepared of the areas that Mr Rawson said he was clearing for the purpose of improving the property for cattle grazing with the location of the plants cut and poisoned by Mr Rawson.  
     
      
    134 Thirdly, not all of the threatened species of plants surveyed by the ecologists from James Warren & Associates, including the ones flagged with pink or other tags, were in fact cut or poisoned by Mr Rawson or at all. Even of the seven threatened species the subject of the offences, many individuals of those species remain on the Norvill property. In some instances, individuals of a threatened species remain in close proximity to plants of the same species cut or poisoned by Mr Rawson. Where Mr Rawson cut or poisoned a threatened species with an identifying tag, he made no attempt to remove the evidence of any tag. It was left on the cut stem on the ground. Mr Rawson also cut and poisoned tens of thousands of other species of plants on the Norvill property. All of these matters speak against a conclusion that Mr Rawson targeted only threatened species on the Norvill property. 
     
      
    135 Mr Rawson, did, however, benefit financially from committing the offences. Mr Rawson was in business as a farm maintenance worker. A large part of his work involved clearing vegetation on rural properties for owners. He was engaged by Mr Mantle of TGM to undertake that work on the Norvill property for a fee of $32.00 per hour. The payments that Mr Rawson received from TGM were for work that included cutting and poisoning plants of the threatened species the subject of the offences. 
     
      
       
      Foreseeability of risk of harm 
       
      
    136 Mr Rawson could reasonably have foreseen that his conduct of cutting and poisoning plants on the Norvill property would cause harm to the environment. Indeed, Mr Rawson’s purpose was to convert the vegetated areas on the Norvill property to pasture land. Mr Rawson admitted that this would involve harming the environment. Mr Rawson said that harm to the environment was inevitable because a farmer cannot make a living out of a farm if bush is left to take over the farm: for “every acre or half acre that disappears you lose a cow because you can’t feed that cow. Instead of running 100 head you have 50 and then it’s not viable”. Hence, Mr Rawson knew that cutting and poisoning vegetation on the property would harm the environment but considered that this was necessary in order to improve the productivity and viability of the farm for cattle grazing. 
     
      
       
      Practical measures 
       
      
    137 Mr Rawson could have and should have refrained from cutting and poisoning plants of threatened species unless and until all necessary approvals had been sought and obtained from the competent regulatory authorities, which authorised the cutting and poisoning of the threatened species.  
     
      
       
      Control over causes 
       
      
    138 Mr Rawson cut and poisoned the plants of the threatened species and thereby had control over the causes of harm to the environment. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion on objective circumstances 
       
      
    139 Having regard to the nature of the offence; the high maximum penalties; the high degree of actual environmental harm caused by Mr Rawson’s conduct constituting the offences; Mr Rawson undertaking the conduct deliberately and in reckless disregard as to whether his conduct was lawful or not; Mr Rawson undertaking the conduct constituting the offences to earn a fee; the foreseeability of risk of harm to the environment by reason of commission of the offences; the existence of practical measures to avoid that risk of harm; Mr Rawson’s control over the causes of harm to the environment, the offence should be considered to be of medium objective gravity or seriousness. 
     
      
       
      SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEFENDANT 
       
      
    140 Within the limits set by reference to the objective gravity of the offences, the Court may take into account the favourable factors personal to the offender. Factors to be considered are: lack of prior criminality; prior good character; plea of guilty to the offences; contrition and remorse; and assistance to authorities.  
     
      
       
      Lack of prior criminality 
       
      
    141 Mr Rawson does not have any prior convictions for any environmental offences. This is a mitigating factor: see s 21A(3)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
       
      Prior good character 
       
      
    142 There is evidence that Mr Rawson has been, otherwise than committing the offences for which he has been charged, a person of good character. This is another mitigating factor: s 21A(3)(f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 19 character references were tendered. They came from a variety of people in the Tweed/Chillingham communities. They have known Mr Rawson from working with him, his volunteer work with NSW Rural Fire Service, being a neighbour or otherwise being a fellow member of the local Chillingham community. They speak of him as being hard working, community spirited, generous with his time to help others, a dedicated family man, a responsible and respected citizen, and “a good bloke”. They speak of his honesty and integrity, being a “man of his word”. 
     
      
    143 Prior good character can have both a negative and a positive aspect: Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 206 CLR 267 at [27]. The negative aspect of good character can refer to the absence of prior convictions and otherwise not having previously engaged in other criminal conduct: Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; (2003) 212 CLR 629 at [25]. The positive aspect of good character can include a history of prior good works and contribution to the community: Ryan v The Queen at [27]. The reason for prior good character being a mitigating factor is that a “morally good” person is less deserving of punishment for a particular offence than a “morally neutral or bad” person who has committed an identical offence: Ryan v The Queen at [30], [31]. 
     
      
    144 Good character may operate to reduce the sentence which the objective facts of the offence would otherwise attract: Ryan v The Queen at [174]. As with prior criminality, prior good character is not part of the objective circumstances of the offence: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [17]. Prior good character is relevant to where, within the boundary set by the objective circumstances, a sentence should lie: R v McNaughton  at [26]. 
     
      
    145 There are two distinct stages in using prior good character in the sentencing process. First, it is necessary to determine whether the offender is of otherwise good character. Secondly, if so, it is necessary to determine the weight that must be given to that mitigating factor. The weight that must be given to the offender’s otherwise good character will vary according to all the circumstances: Ryan v The Queen at [23], [25]. 
     
      
    146 The weight to be given to prior good character depends, to an extent, on the character of the offence committed: R v Smith  (1982) 7 A Crim R 437 at 442; Ryan v The Queen at [143]; R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; (2005) 162 A Crim R 29 at [51]. 
     
      
    147 Certain classes of offences are ones in which many, perhaps even most, offences are committed by persons who are not members of a criminal class or do not have criminal convictions against them: R v MacIntyre (1988) 38 A Crim R 135 at 139; R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 527 at [21];  Ryan v The Queen at [143]. Prior good character may be extended less weight in these classes of offences. Child sexual assault, drug trafficking and drink driving offences are illustrations. White-collar offences are another class. It has been observed that such crimes are rarely committed by people who have a criminal history: R v Rivkin [2004] NSWCCA 7 at [410]; R v Adler [2005] NSWSC 274 at [51]; R v Williams [2005] NSWSC 315 at [61]; R v I R Hall (No 2) [2005] NSWSC 890 at [101]; R v Gent at [59]. Less weight is accorded to prior good character in sentencing for white-collar crimes. 
     
      
    148 Environmental offences are another illustration of a class of offences committed by person who, typically, are of prior good character. They very rarely have previously engaged in other criminal conduct and mostly do not have any prior convictions for environmental offences. The prevalence of the commission of environmental offences by persons of otherwise good character, and the importance of the sentence for environmental offences achieving the purpose of general deterrence, makes the fact that the offender is of otherwise good character of less relevance than it might be in sentencing for other types of offences. 
     
      
    149 In this case, I find Mr Rawson is a person of otherwise good character. However, having regard to the nature of the offences and the importance of general deterrence in sentencing for the offences, less weight should be given to this factor. 
     
      
       
      Plea of guilty 
       
      
    150 Mr Rawson has pleaded guilty to each of the offences: s 21A(3)(k) and s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He is entitled to a discount for the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty to the criminal justice system. In assessing the utilitarian value of the pleas, the timing of the pleas is a critical factor: R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [154]–[160]. A plea entered at the earliest possible opportunity has more significant utilitarian benefit and should attract a higher discount, than a plea entered at a later stage. Section 22(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 requires the sentencing court to take into account not only the fact that the offender has pleaded guilty but also “when the offender pleaded guilty or indicated an intention to plead guilty.” Sentencing courts in New South Wales are required to give full force and effect to s 22 in accordance with its terms: R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142; (2002) 54 NSWLR 300 at [68].151 In this case, Mr Rawson did not enter a plea of guilty to any of the offences until 13 June 2008, 4 months after the first return of each summons before the court on 15 February 2008. Various reasons were given on each of the occasions before the pleas of guilty were entered, for the delay. However, the reason for a delay in a plea of guilty is generally irrelevant because, if a plea is not forthcoming, the utilitarian value is reduced: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32(8)]. As a result of the delay in this case, the discount to be afforded for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty should be reduced from the maximum of 25% stated in the guideline judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Thomson at [160]. 
     
      
    152 Another factor that affects the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty to the criminal justice system is the extent to which the offender has contested unsuccessfully the facts that form the basis for sentence. It is well settled that the utilitarian benefit of a plea of guilty is affected not only by the timing at which the plea is entered but also by the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the length and complexity of the trial. A plea of guilty that avoids the necessity for and difficulty of gathering and adducing evidence on complex issues and a lengthy and complex trial will be of greater utilitarian benefit: R v Thomson at [154].  
     
      
    153 However, the utilitarian benefit of a plea of guilty in such a case will be reduced where the offender, by the plea, admits only the essential legal ingredients of the offence but otherwise contests the factual basis of the plea and on which the court should pass sentence. Any dispute as to factual matters beyond the essential ingredients admitted by the plea must be resolved by accusatorial process upon evidence before the court applying ordinary legal principles appropriate to a criminal trial: Chow v Director of Public Prosecution at 605; R v Palu at [21]. If the contested factual matters, by their nature, extent or complexity, necessitate gathering and adducing evidence and a lengthy or complex sentence hearing to resolve the factual basis for sentence, the utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system that ordinarily should have resulted from the plea of guilty, such as avoiding evidence gathering and a lengthy and complex trial, and the associated costs, will be dissipated: see also Filipowski v Hemina Holdings S.A.; Filipowski v Rajagopalan (No 2) [2009] NSWLEC 104 at [161]-[166]. 
     
      
    154 In this case, although Mr Rawson’s pleas of guilty constituted an admission that he had cut at least one plant of each threatened species the subject of each offence, he contested that he picked the numbers of plants particularised by the prosecutor. This lead to the prosecutor preparing and adducing at the sentence hearing extensive evidence of expert and departmental witnesses to prove that Mr Rawson cut and poisoned the number of plants of each threatened species particularised. I have found the prosecutor has established, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Rawson did pick those numbers of plants. The sentence hearing was therefore extended by Mr Rawson not admitting he picked the plants that I found he did in fact pick. This affects the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    155 On the other hand, the prosecutor sought to establish as an aggravating factor that Mr Rawson’s purpose or motive in picking the plants was to remove constraints on TGM’s proposed mixed residential development and, accordingly, that he deliberately targeted threatened species for removal. Mr Rawson denied these allegations. I have found that the prosecutor has not established, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Rawson did have this purpose of targeting threatened species to remove impediments to TGM’s proposed development. The sentence hearing was extended to address these allegations of the prosecutor. The utilitarian benefit of Mr Rawson’s pleas of guilty is not affected by his contesting, successfully, these allegations of the prosecutor. 
     
      
    156 Taking account of Mr Rawson’s delay in entering the pleas of guilty and his unsuccessful contesting of the numbers of plants picked, the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty should be assessed at 18%. 
     
      
       
      Contrition and remorse 
       
      
    157 Apart from the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty, genuine contrition or remorse is a further mitigating factor. However, s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 states that remorse shown by the offender for the offence will only be a mitigating factor if:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “(i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and 
          
         
        
       
      
    (ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both) …”. 
     
      
    158 The existence of genuine contrition or remorse is also relevant to the weight that needs to be given in sentencing to individual deterrence and the prospects of rehabilitation of the offender: R v Thomson at [116]. Contrition by an offender can be associated with insight by the offender into the reasons for, or factors contributing to, the offending conduct. If an offender has insight into the offending conduct, there is a reduced risk of reoffending and a reduced need for a sentence to be imposed for the purpose of individual deterrence: R v Wisbey [2001] NSWCCA 434 at [31]. 
     
      
    159 In this case, Mr Rawson has accepted responsibility for his actions to the extent that he admitted to picking about one quarter of the threatened plant species. However, Mr Rawson did not admit or denied picking three quarters of the threatened plant species. I have found his reasons for not admitting or denying picking those plants to be not credible. He speculated that other persons must have picked the plants, but such speculation was without evidentiary foundation. Mr Rawson, therefore, sought to avoid responsibility for the great majority of the threatened plant species. This conduct speaks against a finding of contrition and remorse. 
     
      
    160 Mr Rawson has not acknowledged the injury, loss and damage to the threatened species or the environment caused by his actions. He has not made reparation for the environmental harm, although because he was not the owner or occupier of the land he has not been in a position to do so.  
     
      
    161 Mr Rawson has not expressed any regret or remorse for the environmental harm caused by his offending conduct. To the contrary, Mr Rawson was of the view that the environmental harm caused by his conduct was necessary in order to clean up the property for cattle grazing. His view was that the regenerating bush, including the threatened species, needed to be cleared to make the farm viable. He did not express any regret or remorse for doing so. 
     
      
    162 Prior to committing the offences Mr Rawson did not know of the laws that prohibited picking threatened plant species without consent, did not know which species had been listed as threatened species, did not know that the seven species of plants he picked were listed as threatened species, and indeed was not able to identify specifically the plants as any particular species. 
     
      
    163 Subsequently, he attended a workshop on plant identification organised by TGM to assist persons working on the Golf Course and the Norvill property to be able to identify threatened species. This has been of some assistance to Mr Rawson. However, he has not informed himself or sought advice or instruction on the laws regulating the clearing of native vegetation, including threatened plant species, or on the identity of all of the species of plants located in the geographical areas in which he works as a farm maintenance worker clearing vegetation, which have been protected by the law, including by being listed as threatened species. Without such knowledge, there is a risk that Mr Rawson will again reoffend by not being aware of the law and the plant species protected by the law. 
     
      
    164 In these circumstances, I find Mr Rawson does not have genuine contrition and remorse for the commission of the offences or the consequences caused by commission of the offences and there is a risk of reoffending. There is a need for the sentence to include an element of individual deterrence. 
     
      
       
      Assistance to authorities 
       
      
    165 A sentencing court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence: see s 23(1) of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    166 Mr Rawson assisted the prosecutor in these proceedings to the extent that he voluntarily participated in a record of interview on 20 October 2006 with officers of the prosecutor. He also participated in an interview on 4 May 2007, but his participation was not voluntary but directed under the prosecutor’s statutory power. Mr Rawson has not otherwise provided any assistance, including providing information about any other person’s involvement in relation to the land. He has not assisted, or undertaken to assist, in the prevention, detection or investigation of any other offence. 
     
      
       
      THE APPROPRIATE PENALTIES 
       
       
      Purposes of sentencing 
       
      
    167 In fixing the appropriate penalty for the offences, the court needs to consider the purposes of sentencing relevant to the offences and the offender in this case. Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 states that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
        
       
       
        
        (b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
        
       
       
        
        (c) to protect the community from the offender, 
        
       
       
        
        (d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
        
       
       
        
        (e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
        
       
       
        
        (f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
        
       
       
        
        (g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community”. 
         
        
       
      
    168 The purposes of punishment, denunciation and retribution are important in this case. There is the need for the court, through the sentence it imposes, to denounce the conduct of Mr Rawson, to hold him accountable for his actions and to ensure he is adequately punished for the offences. The sentence should accord with the general moral sense of the community in relation to the offences he committed in the circumstances of this case: see R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554 at 555; Inkson v The Queen (1996) 6 Tas R 1 at 15-17, 25, 29-31. The sentence needs to reflect the seriousness with which the informed and responsible public views crimes against the environment and significant components of it, including threatened species, populations and ecological communities: Bentley v BGP Properties at [143]-[149].  
     
      
    169 Retribution for the environmental harm which the offender has caused is important in sentencing for environmental offences. The community must be satisfied that the offender is given his just deserts. Public confidence in the administration of criminal justice depends, at least to some extent, on the courts not failing to have regard to the community’s persistently punitive attitude towards the sentencing of offenders: see Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 206 CLR 267 at [46]; Bentley v BGP Properties at [158]. 
     
      
    170 There is a need for the court to recognise the harm done to the environment, and to the community, by reason of Mr Rawson’s offending conduct. Biological diversity, and components of it such as threatened species, populations and ecological communities, are of intrinsic value but are also of ecological, genetic, social, economic, scientific, educational, cultural, recreational and aesthetic value. Biological diversity is of importance to evolution and for maintaining life sustaining systems of the biosphere. The conservation of biological diversity is a common concern of humankind.  
     
      
    171 Mr Rawson’s offending conduct caused actual environmental harm to seven threatened species and populations of those threatened species and an endangered ecological community; their habitat; and their composition, structure and functioning. Such environmental harm affects the intrinsic and instrumental values of biological diversity, including the threatened species harmed. The sentence of the court needs to reflect this environmental harm and the purpose of restoration and reparation. 
     
      
    172 The sentence of the court also needs to act as a deterrent, both to Mr Rawson to prevent him reoffending, and to other persons to prevent them committing similar offences. Mr Rawson’s lack of remorse for, and insight into, his offending conduct, and his failure to take rehabilitative steps to inform and educate himself on the laws protecting native vegetation including threatened species, populations and ecological communities, and on the identity and identification of threatened species occurring in areas in which he works as a farm maintenance worker clearing native vegetation, gives rise to a real risk that Mr Rawson may reoffend. The court’s sentence needs to deter him from doing so.  
     
      
    173 The sentence of the court also needs to operate as a general deterrent, as a powerful factor in preventing the commission of similar offences by persons who might be tempted to do so by the prospect that, if they are caught, only light punishment will be imposed. The purpose of general deterrence is particularly relevant when imposing sentences for offences of clearing of native vegetation or picking or harming threatened species, populations or ecological communities: see Bentley v BGP Properties at [139]-[142]; Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Rae at [9]-[13].  
     
      
    174 The purposes of sentencing are relevant in determining the type or types of penalties that should be imposed for the offences in this case. Penalties that may be imposed for offences against s 118A(2) include those provided for in the National Parks and Wildlife Act of imprisonment or a fine or both. In addition, Part 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides for other alternatives: where the court has sentenced an offender to imprisonment, the court may direct the sentence be served by alternatives to full time detention, being periodic detention (s 6) and home detention (s 7) or may suspend the sentence (s 12); instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment on an offender, the court may direct the offender perform community service work for a specified number of hours (s 8) or enter a good behaviour bond (s 9); or where the court finds an offender guilty of an offence it may, without proceeding to conviction, make an order dismissing the charges or discharging the offender on conditions (s 10). 
     
      
       
      Appropriateness of imprisonment 
       
      
    175 The prosecutor submits that the offences committed by Mr Rawson are very close to the worst type of case and no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. The prosecutor submits that the offences are very serious because: the offences were committed for personal gain in that Mr Rawson was paid for his work and profited from his offences; the offences were deliberate; the large bulk of the offences were committed after the offender was warned to cease offending; the offences were committed to remove constraints on development; the offences involve the picking of a considerable number of threatened species; the environmental harm caused by the commission of the offences is considerable; and the environmental harm was foreseeable. The prosecutor submits that the sentencing purposes of punishment, individual deterrence and general deterrence make imprisonment the only appropriate penalty. 
     
      
    176 A court considering imposing a sentence of imprisonment on an offender is required to undertake a three stage process: Douar v The Queen [2005] NSWCCA 455; (2005) A Crim R 154 at [69]. Each stage requires the court to consider the objective gravity of the offence balanced against the subjective circumstances of the offender. However, the first stage will principally determine which of the available sentencing alternatives the court should adopt: R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [23]; Douar v The Queen at [69]. 
     
      
    177 The first stage involves asking and answering the preliminary question of whether there are any alternatives to the imposition of a term of imprisonment. A court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate: s 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. At this first stage of the process, the only consideration is whether a sentence of imprisonment should be imposed, not whether it should be suspended or the manner in which it is to be served: R v Zamagias at [25]; Douar v The Queen at [70]. 
     
      
    178 If the court determines that there is no penalty appropriate other than a sentence of imprisonment, the second stage of the process is for the court to determine what the term of the sentence of imprisonment should be: R v Foster [2001] NSWCCA 215 at [30]. The determination of the term of imprisonment is to be made without regard to whether the sentence will be served immediately or the manner in which it is served. As explained in R v Zamagias at [26]: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is because any of the alternatives available in respect of a sentence of imprisonment can only be considered once the sentence has been imposed, see s 6 (periodic detention order), s 7 (home detention order) and s 12 [suspended sentences]. It follows that the term of the sentence cannot be influenced by what order might be made after the sentence has been imposed. For example it cannot be increased because it is to be served by way of periodic detention:  
        R v Wegener 
         [1999] NSWCCA 405, or by home detention:  
        R v Jurisic 
         (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 249. Nor can the term be reduced because an otherwise appropriate alternative is unavailable:  
         R v T 
         (NSWCCA, 19 June 1995).”  
        
       
       
      See also  
      Douar v The Queen 
       at [71]. 
       
      
    179 Once the term of the sentence has been determined, the third stage is for the court to consider how the sentence should be served including whether any alternative to full time imprisonment is available in respect of that term and whether any available alternative should be utilised: R v Zamagias at [28]; Douar v The Queen at [72]. The availability of an alternative to full-time detention will generally be governed by the length of the term that has been determined, subject to the restrictions or pre-conditions imposed by the legislature on a particular sentencing alternative, such as in Part 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for periodic detention and Part 6 for home detention. As noted in R v Zamagias at [28]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appropriateness of an alternative for full time custody will depend on a number of factors, one of importance being whether such an alternative would result in a sentence that reflects the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfils the manifold purposes of punishment. The court in choosing an alternative to full time custody cannot lose sight of the fact that the more lenient the alternative the less likely it is to fulfil all the purposes of punishment:  
        R v Jurisic 
         at 250B”.  
        
       
       
      See also  
      Douar v The Queen 
       at [72]. 
       
      
    180 Having determined the appropriate sentence, the court must explain the sentence imposed. This may require some discussion of the alternatives available and the reasons for choosing a particular alternative: R v Zamagias at [30]; Douar v The Queen at [74]. 
     
      
    181 Imprisonment may be the appropriate penalty for the more serious environmental offences to achieve the purposes of retribution, denunciation, deterrence and incapacitation or protection of the community from the offender. Circumstances where a custodial sentence has been considered to be appropriate punishment to reflect the criminality involved in environmental offences include: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) where the offender’s conduct involves a considerable degree of wilfulness and deception:

    182 The circumstances of the offences and the offender in this case do not cross the custody threshold. There is not the necessary combination of both serious damage or risk of serious damage with a very high degree of culpability on the part of the offender. Although I have found that the environmental harm caused by Mr Rawson’s offending conduct was serious, Mr Rawson’s conduct constituting the offences did not have a very high degree of culpability.  
     
      
    183 Mr Rawson’s conduct was deliberate, in that he deliberately cut and poisoned plants that were in fact threatened species but he did not know before doing so that they were threatened species and protected by law. Mr Rawson did not knowingly or intentionally break the law. There was no planning or organisation to commit the offences. However, he did act in reckless disregard of information, advice and warnings that some plants he had cut and poisoned may have been threatened plants and that cutting and poisoning plants may be contrary to the law. 
     
      
    184 There was no deception. Mr Rawson did not hide or disguise his work of cutting and poisoning plants on the Norvill property or the evidence of this work, such as the cut stems. The threatened plants species he cut and poisoned were left for all to see.  
     
      
    185 Mr Rawson did earn a fee for his work in cutting and poisoning plants but the fee was paid for each hour of work he undertook irrespective of whether the plants he cut and poisoned were threatened species or not. Mr Rawson was not paid to cut and poison only threatened species or paid at a higher rate for cutting and poisoning threatened species. I have found Mr Rawson did not undertake the work of cutting and poisoning certain plant species to remove constraints on TGM’s development proposal for the land but rather that he did the work to improve the productivity of the land for cattle grazing. However, Mr Rawson did not, and it was never intended that he should, benefit from any increased productivity of the land that might result from his work. Mr Rawson was paid the same flat rate for each hour of work done, regardless of any earnings or profit that might accrue to the owner of the land, TGM. 
     
      
    186 Mr Rawson’s offending conduct did extend over a year or so, but the work he carried out was all part of the one continuing course of conduct. It did not involve repetition on a number of separate sites and was not part of any planned or organised criminal activity. 
     
      
    187 Furthermore, there are alternatives to imprisonment that are appropriate for the circumstances of the offences and the offender and the purposes of sentencing in this case. These are a community service order and a fine. 
     
      
       
      Appropriateness of community service order 
      
    188 Section 8(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment on an offender, a court may make a community service order directing the offender to perform community service work for a specified number of hours.” 
         
        
       
      
    189 The opening words of s 8(1) (which appear also at the commencement of s 9(1) relating to good behaviour bonds) confine the availability of such orders to offences for which one of the penalties that the court may impose is imprisonment (Ngo v Fairfield City Council [2009] NSWCCA 241 at [26]) but do not confine the availability of such orders to cases which otherwise would be visited by imposition of a sentence of imprisonment (R v Said El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [32]). 
     
      
    190 “Community service work” is defined in s 3 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 as “any service or activity approved by the Minister, and includes participation in personal development, educational or other programs.” 
     
      
    191 The maximum number of hours specified in a community service order is 500 or the number of hours prescribed by the regulations in respect of the class of offences to which the offence belongs, whichever is the lesser: s 8(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Clause 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Regulation 2005 provides that the prescribed maximum number of hours for offences for which the maximum term of imprisonment exceeds 6 months but does not exceed one year, is 200 hours and for offences for which the maximum term of imprisonment exceeds 1 year, is 500 hours. In this case, this means the maximum number of hours that can be specified in a community service order is 200 hours for each of the four offences against s 118A(2) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act in respect of vulnerable species (which have a maximum term of imprisonment of one year), and 500 hours and for each of the three offences against s 118A(2) in respect of endangered species (which have a maximum term of imprisonment of two years). 
     
      
    192 An offender must not be directed to perform more than eight hours of community service work in any one day or participate in a development program for more than five hours in any one day, except by agreement between the offender and the assigned officer: cl 213 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008. 
     
      
    193 Concurrent or cumulative community service orders may be imposed as long as the total number of hours does not exceed 500: s 87 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    194 The court may impose conditions on a community service order: s 90(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The standard conditions set out in the regulations apply to a community service order: s 108(a) of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act. The conditions imposed by the court must not be inconsistent with the standard conditions imposed by the regulations: s 90(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    195 If a community service order is breached the court has power to sentence the offender for the original offence and exercise any power which it could have exercised had the order not been made: s 115 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act. 
     
      
    196 Section 86 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act regulates the Court’s power to make community service orders. Section 86 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A community service order may not be made with respect to an offender unless the court is satisfied:  
         
          
           
          (a) that the offender is a suitable person for community service work, and 
           
           
          (b) that it is appropriate in all of the circumstances that the offender be required to perform community service work, and 
           
           
          (c) that arrangements exist in the area in which the offender resides or intends to reside for the offender to perform community service work, and 
           
           
          (d) that community service work can be provided in accordance with those arrangements, and 
           
           
          (e) (Repealed) 
          
         
         
        (2) In deciding whether or not to make a community service order, the court must have regard to:  
         
          
           
          (a) the contents of an assessment report on the offender, and 
          
          
           
          (b) such evidence from a probation and parole officer as the court considers necessary for the purpose of deciding whether to make such an order. 
          
         
        
        
         
        (3) A court may, for any reason it considers sufficient, decline to make a community service order despite the contents of an assessment report. 
         
         
        (4) A court may make a community service order only if an assessment report states that, in the opinion of the person making the assessment, the offender is a suitable person for community service work. 
         
         
        (5) If a court makes a community service order in respect of an offender, the offender must, as soon as practicable (having regard to sections 92 and 93) after the order is made, sign an undertaking to comply with the offender’s obligations under the order. If the offender refuses to sign such an undertaking, the offender may be brought before the court and the court may revoke the community service order and impose such other sentence as it considers appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    197 The NSW Department of Corrective Services, Probation and Parole Service, have provided two pre-sentence reports dated 21 April 2009 and 4 June 2009. In both reports, Mr Rawson is assessed as being suitable for a community service order as required by s 86(1)(a) and he has signed an undertaking as required by s 86(5) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In the 4 June 2009 report, the Service informed the Court that arrangements exist in the area in which Mr Rawson resides for Mr Rawson to perform community service work and community service work can be provided in accordance with those arrangements, as required by s 86(1)(c) and (d). The Service stated that should Mr Rawson be sentenced to a community service order, “he would be placed with the Byron Bay Island Quarry Association, a not-for-profit organisation which undertakes environmental regeneration, including replanting, and landscaping work on the site of and surrounding a disused quarry.” The Service also noted that Mr Rawson “would be required to travel to and from the nominated agency using his own resources. It is not departmental policy to include travelling time in the calculation of hours worked under a community service order.” 
     
      
    198 A community service order can be a “real and effective” alternative to imprisonment. The impact and severity of a non-custodial sentence, such as community service, can be severe on an offender and “ought not to be regarded by the public as a minor or insignificant reaction by the courts”: see R v Burton [1982] 1 NZLR 602 at 604; R v Conway at [59]. In R v Said El Masri at [37], the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal observed that:  
     
      
       
        
         
        “A sentence of 300 hours community service, with the ongoing and recurring obligation to perform work over an extended period of time, constitutes a significant penalty.” 
        
       
      
    199 Community service may be appropriate where the sentencing purpose of reparation is relevant. A community service order contains a requirement of reparation to the community: R v Kelleher at [23]. A community service order may not be an appropriate sentence where retribution, accountability for harm done to the community, denunciation and deterrence are the most important sentencing goals: R v Conway at [59], [66], [67], [71] and [72]. 
     
      
    200 In this case, there is a need for the sentence to recognise the harm done by Mr Rawson’s offending conduct to the environment and the community. Restoration of the environment harmed is not readily achievable as Mr Rawson is not the owner or occupier of the Norvill property and no longer is engaged to work on the property. Similarly, reparation cannot be directly achieved. However, an order requiring Mr Rawson to perform community service work contains a requirement of reparation to the community. 201 An order that Mr Rawson perform community service work of the nominated nature and with the nominated agency would involve reparation to the community, in the form of environmental regeneration including replanting, that is relevant to the offences of picking threatened plant species and the environmental consequences of those offences in this case.  
     
      
       
      Appropriateness of fine 
       
      
    202 A fine is the most common sentencing option and often the most appropriate penalty for environmental offences. The fine embodies the legislative view, based on community standards, of the seriousness of criminal conduct. A fine can achieve the purposes of sentencing of retribution, accountability, denunciation and deterrence. A fine is appropriate in the circumstances of the offences and the offender in this case.  
     
      
       
      Combination of community service order and fine 
       
      
    203 Although the sentence of the court needs to include elements of retribution, accountability, denunciation and deterrence in this case, this can be achieved by combining a community service order with a fine that achieves these purposes. Although s 90(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that any payment of money whether in the nature of a fine, compensation or otherwise, may not be made a condition of a community service order, it does not provide that additional orders such as a fine that the court may impose as a penalty, may not be made in addition to a community service order. 
     
      
    204 The combination of a community service order and a fine may be the appropriate sentencing package that is proportionate to the objective gravity of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the offender: see R v Burton at 605; Environment Protection Authority v White (1996) 92 LGERA 264 at 273; Environment Protection Authority v Coggins [2003] NSWLEC 111; (2003) 126 LGERA 219 at [58], [60]; Garrett v Williams [2007] NSWLEC 56 at [54]-[58]; Environment Protection Authority v Pal [2009] NSWLEC 35 at [140], [144]; Environment Protection Authority v Pal (No 2) [2009] NSWLEC 60 at [19]. 
     
      
       
      Amount of fine and financial means 
       
      
    205 The amount of the fine needs to reflect the objective circumstances of the offences and offender, and the overall medium objective gravity of the offences, mitigated by the relevant subjective circumstances of Mr Rawson. 
     
      
    206 However, the court is also required to consider the financial means of the offender to pay a fine. Section 6 of the Fines Act 1996:  
     
      
       
        
        “In the exercise by a court of a discretion to fix the amount of any fine, the court is required to consider:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) such information regarding the means of the accused as is reasonably and practicably available to the court for consideration, and 
         
         
        (b) such other matters as, in the opinion of the court, are relevant to the fixing of that amount.” 
         
        
       
      
    207 A “fine” includes any monetary penalty imposed by the court as well as any costs (including expenses or disbursements) payable by a person under an order made by a court in proceedings for an offence that were brought by a law enforcement officer: s 4(1)(a) and (f) of the Fines Act. The prosecutor in this case is a law enforcement officer: see definition of “law enforcement officer” in s 3 of the Fines Act. Hence, the court needs to consider the financial means of Mr Rawson in exercising its discretion to fix the amount of any monetary penalty for each offence and any costs order payable by Mr Rawson. 
     
      
    208 Once a determination has been made that a fine should be imposed the correct procedure in assessing the appropriate amount of the fine is to determine it by reference to the gravity of the offence for which it is imposed. If the court is satisfied that the offender would be unable to pay the amount determined, the court may reduce the amount of the fine to take account of the offender’s means and impecuniosity: R v Rahme (1989) 43 A Crim R 81 at 86-87.  
     
      
    209 Mr Rawson is 59 years of age. He separated two years ago from his wife to whom he had been married for 36 years. He has three children. He has no qualifications and left high school at 14 years of age. He has worked as a fencing contractor, trail ride operator and a self-employed farm maintenance worker which is his current employment. He works for $32.00 an hour. 
     
      
    210 His principal asset is a farm at Chillingham. There was no independent valuation of its worth but Mr Rawson thought it would be worth about $650,000. It is unencumbered. He owns cattle on the farm. He also owns an old Massey Ferguson tractor and an old red utility which he drives to the farms on which he undertakes farm maintenance work. He owns tools of the trade, including chainsaws and spray equipment. After separating from his wife, he moved out of the house on the farm to a tin shed elsewhere on the farm. It provides rudimentary living quarters, with a bed, kitchenette and bathroom facilities. 
     
      
    211 In this case, another factor relevant to Mr Rawson’s ability to pay a fine and costs order is the fact that TGM has given Mr Rawson an indemnity for all fines and costs orders that might be imposed. 
     
      
    212 The first deed of agreement was dated 20 May 2007. TGM agreed to reimburse and indemnify Mr Rawson for any expense incurred by or penalty imposed upon Mr Rawson in relation to the investigation and prosecution of the offences, “including legal expenses, investigation expenses, fines or other monetary penalties.” This agreement was varied by a deed of variation dated 17 July 2008. The effect of the variation was to cap TGM’s liability under the indemnity agreement at a maximum amount of $200,000. 
     
      
    213 Evidence was given that Mr Rawson’s legal and other expenses to date have been around $175,000. These have been paid or reimbursed by TGM under the indemnity agreement. Mr Rawson has not yet had to pay any expenses himself. 
     
      
       
      Prosecutor’s costs 
       
      
    214 The prosecutor seeks an order under s 257B of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 that Mr Rawson pay the prosecutor’s costs. Where an offender is convicted of an offence against the National Parks and Wildlife Act and is ordered to pay costs under the Criminal Procedure Act, those costs are to be paid into the National Parks and Wildlife Fund maintained under s 137 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act: see s 176(3) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act. 
     
      
    215 The prosecutor stated that its costs are in excess of $300,000. No agreement as to the amount of costs has been reached between the prosecutor and Mr Rawson. Indeed, Mr Rawson submits the amount of costs has been increased by the prosecutor seeking to prove the aggravating facts that Mr Rawson knew and targeted threatened species to remove constraints on TGM’s proposed residential development of the Norvill property. Mr Rawson submits the court should specify an amount of costs that excludes the costs and expenses relating to these facts. Mr Rawson also submits that the court should specify an amount of costs having regard to Mr Rawson’s means to pay. The court can specify an amount of costs under s 257B of the Criminal Procedure Act or direct that costs are to be determined in accordance with s 257G of the Criminal Procedure Act. 
     
      
       
      The appropriate penalties 
       
      
    216 Having regard to the purposes for which sentences should be imposed for these offences, the objective circumstances of the offences and of the offender, and the mitigating subjective circumstances of the offender, I consider the appropriate penalties for each offence are a fine and a community service order.  
     
      
    217 The amount of the fine and the number of hours of community service for each offence should be determined by an instinctive synthesis of all of the relevant objective and subjective circumstances of the offence and offender: Markarian v The Queen at [37], [39], [66] and [73]. Accordingly, I have taken into account each of the objective circumstances of the offence and offender, and the medium objective gravity of each offence, as mitigated by the relevant subjective circumstances of Mr Rawson. For each offence, I have considered the cumulative effect of having both a fine and community service order in fixing the amount of the fine and the number of hours of community service. As between the offences, the classification of the threatened species concerned (endangered or vulnerable), the number of the whole plants affected, and the degree of environmental harm caused affect the amount of the fine and the number of hours of community service. 
     
      
    218 Considering each offence by itself, the appropriate penalties for each offence would be as follows:

    220 Because there are multiple offences, and the sentences for each offence involve a combination of a fine with another sentence of a community service order, the totality principle is applicable: R v Sgroi (1989) 40 A Crim R 197 at 203. The effect of the totality principle is to require the court which has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate is “just and appropriate” and reflects the total criminality before the court: R v Visconti [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 at 114, 115; R v Holder; R v Johnston  [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 260; Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 62-63; Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [49]. 
     
      
    221 To reflect the fact that a number of sentences are being imposed, an appropriate result may be reached, in relation to sentences for detention, regardless of the manner they are to be served, either by making sentences wholly or partially concurrent or by lowering the individual sentences below what would otherwise be appropriate (Mill v The Queen at 63), and in relation to fines, by reducing the amount of the fine for each offence: Camilleri’s Stock Feeds Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority at 703-704; Environment Protection Authority v Barnes [2006] NSWCCA 246 at [50]; Robinson v Eureka Operations Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 784 at [52]. 
     
      
    222 Care must be taken, however, to ensure that any adjustment of individual sentences does not cause the aggregate sentence not to reflect the total criminality of the offender’s conduct or the sentence for any individual offence to become disproportionate to the objective gravity of that offence: R v A [1999] NSWCCA 61 at [32]; R v Weldon; R v Carberry [2002] NSWCCA 475; (2002) 136 A Crim R 55 at [46]; R v KM; R v Linh Van Nguyen; R v Nguyen; R v Tran [2004] NSWCCA 65 at [55]; Vaovasa v R [2007] NSWCCA 253; (2007) 174 A Crim R 116 at [18]; Robinson v Eureka Operations at [52]. 
     
      
    223 In this case, I consider the totality principle does require there to be an adjustment of the combined penalties for each offence. In aggregate, I consider a fine of $270,600 and 270 hours of community service to exceed what is just and appropriate. The aggregate sentence can be adjusted to reflect the total criminality involved in Mr Rawson’s conduct by reducing the number of hours of community service to 200. This can be achieved by making the hours of community service work to be performed under the community service orders made in proceedings nos 50077/07, 50078/07, 50079/07, 50081/07 and 50083/07 run concurrently with the hours of community service work to be performed under the community service order made in proceeding no 50082/07.  
     
      
    224 The hours of community service work to be performed under the community service orders made in proceedings nos 50080/07 and 50082/07 should, however, run consecutively, giving a total of 200 hours of community service. The sentence for proceedings no 50080/07 should commence at the end of the sentence for proceedings no 50082/07. There is no inflexible rule that concurrent sentences should be imposed for multiple offences arising out of the one criminal course of conduct: R v Weldon at [48]; Vaovasa v R at [16]. Offences committed as part of the one criminal course of conduct may need to be met with cumulative or partially cumulative sentences in order to reflect the totality of the criminality involved in the commission of the offences, or to take account of differences in conduct or consequences such as where there is more than one victim: R v Weldon at [46]-[48]; R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288 at [21]-[23].  
     
      
    225 The fact that the offences involve seven threatened plant species, being three endangered and four vulnerable plant species, harm to over a thousand plants and their habitat, and different environmental consequences, requires an increase in the sentences that would otherwise be appropriate if only one threatened species and a small number of plants and habitat had been harmed, involving the same environmental consequences.  
     
      
    226 If this adjustment is made to the community service orders, I do not consider it necessary to reduce the amounts of the fines for each offence. To do so would cause the individual sentences to become disproportionate to the objective gravity of each offence and the aggregate sentence to not reflect the total criminality involved. 
     
      
    227 Having assessed the appropriate amounts of the fines for the individual offences and in aggregate, it is necessary to assess whether Mr Rawson has the financial means to pay the amounts determined. Having regard to the information available concerning Mr Rawson’s assets (principally his unencumbered farm) and income as a self-employed farm maintenance worker, I consider that Mr Rawson would be unable to pay an aggregate amount of fines of $270,600 as well as an order for costs, which if no adjustment is made, might be in the order of $300,000. 
     
      
    228 In these circumstances, I consider that I ought reduce the aggregate amount of the fines to $135,000. This should be apportioned between the offences (with some rounding) as follows: $5,000 for 50077/07; $2,000 for 50078/07; $6,000 for 50079/07; $35,000 for 50080/07; $17,000 for 50081/07; $66,000 for 50082/07; and $4,000 for 50083/07.  
     
      
    229 The fines are required to be paid within 28 days of the sentences imposing the fines: s 7 of the Fines Act. However, the registrar of the court may allow time for the payment of the fines: s 10 of the Fines Act. 
     
      
    230 The fines paid are to be paid into the National Parks and Wildlife Fund, pursuant to s 138(1)(b)(vii) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act. 
     
      
    231 I also consider it appropriate for there to be an order under s 257B of the Criminal Procedure Act that Mr Rawson pay the prosecutor’s costs. The prosecutor ought to be compensated for the costs of bringing the prosecutions, which are in the public interest: see Environment Protection Authority v Taylor [No 4] [2002] NSWLEC 59; (2002) 120 LGERA 414 at [45].  
     
      
    232 The prosecutor states its costs exceed $300,000. However, this amount of costs would include costs and expenses relating to the prosecutor’s case that Mr Rawson knew and targeted threatened species to remove constraints on TGM’s proposed residential development of the Norvill property. I have found that the prosecutor has not established these aggravating facts beyond reasonable doubt. Mr Rawson should not pay for the costs and expenses relating to these matters on which the prosecutor was unsuccessful.  
     
      
    233 There is no evidence to allow the Court to calculate the amount of the costs and expenses relating to these matters, which ought to be excluded from the amount of costs ordered, but they may be significant having regard to the extent of evidence gathered on and hearing time devoted to these matters. It is therefore appropriate to order Mr Rawson to pay the prosecutor’s costs excluding costs and expenses relating to the prosecutor’s case that Mr Rawson knew and targeted threatened species to remove constraints on any proposed development of the property, such costs to be determined in accordance with s 257G of the Criminal Procedure Act.  
     
      
    234 The exclusion of these costs and expenses will reduce materially the amount of costs that Mr Rawson would need to pay, which is relevant having regard to Mr Rawson’s means to pay.  
     
      
    235 Any costs paid by Mr Rawson pursuant to the costs order should be paid into the National Parks and Wildlife Fund, in accordance with s 176(3) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 YOUNG JA : I agree with Latham J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J : I agree with Latham J. 
     
      
    3 LATHAM J : The applicant, Van Cuong Pham, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on 12 December 2008 by Freeman DCJ (the Judge) following the applicant’s plea of guilty to an offence of cultivate, by enhanced indoor means, a commercial quantity of a prohibited plant, contrary to s 23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, committed on 13 August 2008. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. The applicant also pleaded guilty to an offence of organise/conduct/assist drug premises under s 36Z(1)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (the Act), which carries a maximum penalty of 12 months imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 A further offence, namely, alter or add to electricity installation for metering without authority under s 70 of the Electricity Supply Act 1995, was taken into account on a Form One for the purposes of sentence on the cultivate offence. That offence carries a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment. 5 The applicant received a non parole period of 18 months with a balance of term of 18 months for the offence of cultivate prohibited plant. A term of 6 months imprisonment was imposed for the 36Z(1)(a) offence, but was made wholly concurrent. The sole ground of appeal is that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      The Offence 
       
      
    6 The following summary of the facts is taken from the Judge’s remarks on sentence and is not disputed :- 
     
      
       
        
        At the premises in Riverwood of which [the offender] was the sole resident there was a garage separate from the house and the garage had been extended. From relative proximity to that latter building it was possible to hear electrical machines operating, to feel the disposition of excess heat, and of course to smell cannabis on the air which was being expelled from that building. Doubtless on the basis of those observations the police visited the premises a couple of times before arriving with a search warrant on 13 August 2008. 
         
        When the police arrived the offender opened the door, stepped outside, handed over the keys, and thereafter cooperated fully as one could expect, both in assisting the execution of the search warrant, identifying the keys necessary to open the three separate purpose-built rooms contained within the garage structure, and later taking part in the recorded interview in which he made full and frank admissions concerning his role, which was to water and fertilise the 112 plants, and to turn on and off the fluorescent type lighting with which their growth was being encouraged. 
         
        The total street value is estimated to be over half a million dollars, and that quantity brings the cultivation into the commercial quantity. It was a sophisticated arrangement whereby each plant was grown in a separate pot. The pots were joined to an irrigation system through which flowed both water and nutrients. The plants had been assisted to grow upright by the use of either wire ties or wire netting. 
         
        The laundry of the garage building contained a large amount of electrical transformers used to power this hydroponic setup, and they were in turn connected to the electricity supply by way of a bypass of the electricity meter. The set up was examined by an expert who deemed it dangerous and illegal. 
         
        The cooperation of the offender extended to his willing supply of prints, and his fingerprints were later identified on numerous exhibits seized within the garage itself. 
        
       
      
    7 The Judge made the following findings with respect to the objective gravity of the offence :- 
     
      
      *the offence was serious, given the very considerable quantity of cannabis capable of being produced. 
       
      *the applicant's role in the commission of the offence was at a relatively low level, he having been recruited by other unidentified persons. 
       
      *the applicant did not construct the purpose-built rooms, or buy or bring on site the plants or the fertiliser and was not responsible for bypassing the electricity meter. In effect, he acted as a “babysitter” for the crop. 
       
      *the applicant expected that he would receive something between $10,000 and $15,000 for his contribution to the cultivation of the crop, and therefore committed the offence for financial gain. 
       
      *A significant sentence was required in the interests of general deterrence. 
       
      
     The Applicant’s Subjective Case 
     
      
    8 The bulk of the Judge’s remarks on sentence was occupied with the applicant’s subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    9 The applicant had no prior criminal history. He was 43 years old at the time of sentence. The applicant was born in Vietnam, married at the age of 21 years and had his first child shortly thereafter. The family left Vietnam in 1988, travelling by boat to Hong Kong where they lived in a refugee camp for three years. There they had their second child. The applicant and his family entered Australia in 1991 and were granted Australian citizenship in 1994. He and his wife separated at that time, but they remain on good terms. 
     
      
    10 Largely because of the applicant's poor English skills, he was unable to obtain employment until 1996 when he gained a position as a stonemason. He retained that employment until 2002 when he sustained a significant back injury. The applicant has not worked since that time and has been reliant on workers compensation payments. There was medical evidence that confirmed the applicant's chronic back pain and daily medication. The applicant's alcohol consumption had increased as a consequence. In about 2004 the applicant began to consume cannabis on a daily basis in order to reduce his pain.  
     
      
    11 The applicant stated to the Probation and Parole officer that he engaged in the offence as a means of obtaining cannabis and making extra money. The applicant was finding it difficult to meet his living expenses from his workers compensation payments, although his financial hardship was partly attributable to his weekly gambling habit. The applicant's back injury was accompanied by depression, for which the applicant has taken medication consistently since 2003. The Judge accepted that the applicant was clinically depressed at the time of the commission of the offence and for that reason the emphasis on general deterrence in the sentencing exercise was ""somewhat lessened"". 
     
      
       
      Whether the Sentence is Manifestly Excessive 
       
      
    12 The applicant’s argument begins with the proposition that, after factoring in the 25% discount attributable to the early plea of guilty, a notional starting point of 4 years is excessive, given the applicant’s role in the offence, his subjective case, prior good character and his Honour’s determination with regard to general deterrence. 
     
      
    13 The applicant seeks to support that contention by reference to two decisions of this Court in particular, both of which relate to the hydroponic cultivation of a commercial quantity of cannabis plants, prior to the introduction on 14 July 2006 of the penalty regime applicable to cultivation by “enhanced indoor means”. In practical terms, these decisions relate to the hydroponic cultivation of more than 250 plants, because at that time the Act did not reflect the potential for increased risk of harm to users of hydroponically grown cannabis. Following recognition of the significantly increased yield of the more potent parts of the cannabis plant when grown hydroponically, the legislature prescribed 50 plants as the commercial quantity for such crops.  
     
      
    14 Before turning to those decisions, it is noteworthy that this reduction of the threshold for a commercial quantity in such cases was intended to signal an increase in the gravity of the offence of cultivation by these means, as viewed by the legislature. The second reading speech introducing the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Amendment (Hydroponic Cultivation) Bill on 25 May 2006 included the following :- 
     
      
       
        
        Cannabis plants cultivated by hydroponic and other enhanced indoor means grow much faster than plants grown by traditional outdoor methods, and produce between five and seven times the yield. The current quantity amounts in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act at which maximum penalties apply for cannabis cultivation offences are based upon the yield, harvest patterns and profitability of outdoor, or ""bush grown"" cannabis. They are not an accurate reflection of the commerciality of hydroponic cannabis operations. This bill addresses this inequity.Schedule 1 amends the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Item [1] inserts in the Act a definition of ""cultivation by enhanced indoor means"" in relation to a prohibited plant. The two leading methods of enhanced indoor cannabis cultivation—hydroponics and aeroponics—are covered by the definition. Item [16] inserts a new plant category into schedule 1 of the Act entitled ""Cannabis plant cultivated by enhanced indoor means"", with the commercial and large commercial quantities being set at levels five times lower than for outdoor cannabis to reflect the much higher yields produced by this method. This means that existing maximum penalties for cultivation offences involving commercial and large commercial quantities will cut in at these lower levels in respect of cannabis cultivated by enhanced indoor means to reflect the commerciality of operations of this size. 
        
       
      
    15 Against this background, I turn to a consideration of R v Godden [2005] NSWCCA 160 and R v Quan [2006] NSWCCA 382. Both of these offenders pleaded guilty at an early stage. 
     
      
    16 Godden was a successful appeal against the severity of a sentence of 3 years and 2 months imposed for the hydroponic cultivation of 319 cannabis plants. The offender was responsible for setting up and operating the plantation. He had done so during the currency of a bond to be of good behaviour. The sentence was held to be manifestly excessive having regard to a number of other decisions of the Court between 1993 and 1997. The Court substituted a sentence of 2 years and 2 months. 
     
      
    17 Quan was also a successful appeal against a sentence of 3 years and 2 months imposed for the hydroponic cultivation of 284 plants in the offender’s home. Relevantly, the offender was a Vietnamese man with no prior criminal convictions whose gambling and alcohol addictions had motivated him to commit the offence for financial gain. The Court refrained from an explicit finding that the sentence was manifestly excessive, but felt constrained by the decision in Godden to reduce the offender’s sentence in order to maintain consistency. A sentence of 2 years and 2 months was accordingly imposed.  
     
      
    18 The applicant also referred the Court to Huu Chien Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 94. The offender in that case pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the cultivation of 278 cannabis plants between November 2005 and February 2006, in various parts of a house occupied by the offender, which were equipped with lights, fans and ventilation systems. A sentence of 2 years and 6 months was held not to be excessive, notwithstanding a submission that the sentence imposed on appeal in Godden for a greater quantity of plants suggested error. The rationale of Hulme J’s judgment (McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J agreeing) depended in large part upon the fact that “the actus reus of the offence charged consists simply of cultivation of not less than 250 plants.” (at [20])19 The applicant submits that the offender in Nguyen was significantly more culpable, presumably because Nguyen was found to be the principal and because of the number of plants. The fact that the notional starting point for the sentence in Nguyen (40 months) was 8 months less than the starting point in the applicant’s case is said to demonstrate manifest excess.  
     
      
    20 This analysis suffers from the same flaw as the comparison sought to be made with Godden and Quan, namely, the applicant is not comparing like with like. In the light of the legislative change to the relevant quantity for the purpose of exposing offenders to a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment for the cultivation of not less than 50 plants, it is simply not correct to draw an analogy with other sentences imposed under an entirely different penalty regime. Under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act the quantity of the drug, and its relationship to the categories “indictable”, “commercial” and “large commercial”, are significant determinants of the seriousness of the offence ; R v Sciberras [2006] NSWCCA 268 ; (2006) 165 A Crim R 532 ; R v Truong [2006] NSWCCA 318. The applicant’s offence is prima facie more serious than like offences under the former penalty regime considered by this Court.  
     
      
    21 The Crown drew the Court’s attention to Van Cuong Nguyen v R [2008] NSWCCA 322. The Court rejected a ground of manifest excess in relation to a sentence of 5 years for the indoor cultivation of 105 plants in May 2007, that is, when the relevant commercial quantity was 50 plants. The offender in that case was the owner of the property and admitted to setting up the plantation. Relevantly, Tobias JA (James and Price JJ agreeing) said :- 
     
      
       
        
        … what is clear is that 105 plants is just over twice the commercial quantity for plants cultivated by enhanced indoor means. …. It seems to me that it was clearly open to the sentencing judge to conclude that the objective seriousness of the offences was “somewhere about the middle of the range”. 
        
       
      
    22 There was no express finding by the Judge as to where in the range indicated by the maximum penalty this offence lay, but, having regard to Tobias JA’s views in Nguyen above, it would be difficult to sustain a submission that it was significantly below the mid range.  
     
      
    23 In Truong v R [2009] NSWCCA 41, the Court dismissed an appeal against the severity of a sentence of 3 years and 6 months for the indoor cultivation of 189 plants in January 2007. The offender’s subjective circumstances in that case were consistent with those of the applicant. The offender was a Vietnamese refugee who was in financial difficulties as a result of the breakdown of her relationship. Although she owned the property in which the crop was found, she claimed to police that she was a “mere crop sitter”, but that she expected to be paid for her services. The offender pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. The sentence reflected the fact that the offender had the full time care of a young daughter. McClellan CJ at CL (James and Adams JJ agreeing) said :- 
     
      
       
        
        I accept that the applicant has had a difficult life. It will never be easy for someone of limited education who by force of circumstances becomes a refugee and is required to settle in another country. When that person’s circumstances are further exacerbated by difficulties in her domestic relationship the problems are greater. However, whatever be the difficulties such a person faces, our community does not tolerate the cultivation of illegal drugs and their propagation within the community. 
        
       
      
    24 Lastly, in Thi Lan Nguyen v R [2009] NSWCCA 181 the Court allowed an appeal against the severity of a sentence of 4 years for the indoor cultivation of 172 plants in December 2007. The offender, a Vietnamese national with no prior criminal convictions, had undertaken the care of the plantation on behalf of others. She pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. McCallum J observed at [55] that :- 
     
      
       
        
        The sentence imposed ….. was substantially harsher than those that have been imposed to date in comparable circumstances in the relatively small number of cases determined in respect of the new plant category. 
        
       
       
        
        It is particularly difficult to reconcile the applicant’s sentence with the sentence imposed by the same judge in  
        Truong 
        , …. [where] it may be accepted that the role of the offender in that case warranted a more severe penalty … [as the owner of] the relevant premises. 
        
       
      
    25 Despite referring to the decision of Van Cuong Nguyen at [50], the Court was nonetheless persuaded that the sentence imposed at first instance upon Thi Lan Nguyen was “substantially harsher” than that imposed in the small number of comparable cases brought to its attention. The Court substituted a sentence of 3 years imprisonment, after taking into account the offender’s isolation as a non-English speaker whose family remained in Vietnam. It is not without significance that there was no Form One offence to be taken into account, as in the applicant’s case. 
     
      
    26 In my view, the three decisions of this Court that deal directly with offences committed under the new penalty regime tend to establish that the applicant’s sentence was well within range. Considerable caution ought to be exercised in reaching any conclusion that a given sentence is outside the appropriate range when so few prosecutions have been brought to the Court’s attention. The applicant bears the onus of satisfying the Court that the sentence is not just severe, but that it is manifestly excessive. I am not so persuaded. 
     
      
    27 I propose the following orders :- 
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal granted. 
      
     2. Appeal dismissed.

   IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESEQUITY DIVISIONSmart AJFriday 30 October 20093196/08 Mary Alafaci & Anor v Marco Mangano & 3 Ors 
     
      
    JUDGMENT 
     
      
    1 The plaintiffs, Mary Alafaci and Paul Alafaci, by their Amended Summons filed 5 August 2008 sought orders restraining each of the four defendants (Marco Mangano, Janel Giuliano (neé Mangano), Janice Mangano and Nicole Giuliano (also known as Nicole Mangano and Nicole Tremaine)) from using any documents obtained on subpoena during proceedings 5491 of 2006 sub nom Mangano & Ors v Alafaci & Ors (Family Provision Act proceedings) for any purpose not directly connected with those Supreme Court proceedings including but not limited to Guardianship Tribunal Proceedings number C/32576 and from divulging, communicating or referring to any of the documents or the information contained therein to any person. The plaintiffs also sought that each of the defendants be found guilty of contempt of court and “committed to imprisonment” and further or in the alternative that each of the defendants pay a fine and further or in the alternative that the estate of each defendant be subject to sequestration and further or in the alternative an order that each defendant be punished on terms as the Court thinks fit pursuant to Part 55 r 13(3) of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 (suspension of punishment and bonds amongst other punishments). The Amended Summons added Nicole as the fourth defendant; the initiating Summons of 11 June 2008 was against the first, second and third defendants. 
     
      
    2 In her opening speech Senior Counsel for the plaintiffs announced that the plaintiffs were not seeking incarceration of the defendants despite the prayer in the Amended Summons to that effect. She stated that the plaintiffs were seeking: 
     
      
       
      a) continuation of the order dated 20 August 2008 by order of the Court (in contrast to the current order, which is by consent and without admissions) That order relevantly reads: 
       
        
         
        “Until further order of the Court, order that the defendants and each of them be restrained from using any documents obtained on subpoena during proceedings number 5491 of 2006 … for any purpose not directly connected with those proceedings including but not limited to Guardianship Tribunal proceedings number C/32576.”;  
         
        
        
        (The second injunction sought in the Amended Summons probably goes a little further.) 
         
        
       
      b) orders and declarations as in the Amended Summon in relation to each defendant’s contempt; 
       
      c) payment of a fine which reflects the seriousness of the contempt, the lack of contrition by the defendants and the desirability of a deterrent; and 
       
      d) costs of these proceedings to be paid by the defendants. 
       
       
        
        (This was repeated in the closing written submissions of 24 July 2009 of the plaintiffs.) 
        
       
      
    3 Mary Alafaci is the mother of Paul Alafaci and Janice Mangano. Marco, Janel and Nicole are the children of Janice. I will use first names for ease of reference. The family is divided into two bitter warring factions with Mary and Paul comprising one faction and Janice, Marco, Janel and Nicole the other. Mary Alafaci is now an 87 year-old widow. Her husband Anthony Alafaci died on 19 October 2005. On 13 January 2006 probate of his will of 19 March 2003 was granted to Mary Alafaci, Paul Alafaci and Angelo Hatsatouris (a solicitor). Anthony Alafaci left his entire estate to his widow, Mary. The estate mainly consisted of shares in Pamaja Pty Limited valued at $2,079,000. There were assets held in the joint names of Anthony and Mary of considerable value. It was estimated that the total value of the assets which passed to Mary was of the order of $6 million. 
     
      
    Procedural preliminaries 
     
      
    4 The Statements of Charge were not filed with the Amended Summon nor by the extended date of 10 October 2008. The Statements of Charge were filed and served about 24 October 2008. On 3 November 2008 directions were given that the defendants serve their affidavits by 17 November 2008 and the plaintiffs serve any affidavits in reply by 24 November 2008. On 1 December 2008 the hearing of the plaintiffs’ Amended Summons was fixed for hearing on 24 April 2009. 
     
      
    5 While it is established that strict compliance with the Rules and Orders of the Court is required in contempt matters, I enlarge the time for complying with SCR 55.7 and the Orders of the Court until 24 October 2008 for the following reasons. 
     
      
       
      a) Each of the defendants has been aware of the substance of the charge made against such defendant since the end of October 2008. Each of the defendants has had the plaintiffs’ principal affidavits since late August 2008. 
       
       
      b) No relevant prejudice has been suffered by the defendants by any of the non-compliances of the plaintiffs with the Rules and Orders of the Court. 
       
      
    6 On 28 April 2009 during the hearing, the plaintiffs were granted leave to file and filed Amended Statements of Charge after the defendants had raised some objections to those of 24 October 2008. 
     
      
    Service 
     
      
    7 Objection was also taken that the plaintiffs had not complied with SCR 55.9 which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The notice of motion or summons, the statement of charge and the affidavits shall be served personally on the contemnor.” 
        
       
      
    8 Each of the four defendants has entered an appearance. Each of the four defendants was represented by counsel when the Court made the consent orders of 8 October 2008. Each was represented in Court on 3 November 2008 when directions were made for the filing of the defendants’ affidavits. 
     
      
    9 In the light of the history of the matter and the participation of the defendants in these proceedings any right to personal service of the Summons and Statements of Charge has been waived. Alternatively, I would dispense with SCR 55.9, see s 14 of Civil Procedure Act 2005. I do not regard the general words “rules of Court” as limited to the UCP Rules. See also s10 of that Act. 
     
      
    Background 
     
      
    10 On 14 November 2005 Janel commenced proceedings for a guardianship order in relation to Mary. She was supported by her brother, Marco, and her mother, Janice. On 29 March 2006 Janel commenced Guardianship Tribunal proceedings to review an Enduring Power of Attorney granted by Mary Alafaci in favour of her son, Paul. On 3 May 2006 the application for review of the Enduring Power of Attorney was adjourned for six months and the application for guardianship of Mary was dismissed. On 7 May 2007 the application for a financial management order in respect of Mary was dismissed, as was the application to review the Enduring Power of Attorney granted in 2006 to her son, Paul Alafaci. That Power of Attorney had been revoked and the Tribunal no longer had jurisdiction to consider it. On 15 December 2006 Janice, Marco and Paul Mangano (grandson of Anthony) commenced proceedings under the Family Provision Act 1982 (5491 of 2006). 
     
      
    11 On 5 September 2007 a Calderbank offer was accepted by Mr Marco Mangano. That involved: 
     
      
       
       1. discharge and release in relation to the $150,000 owed by Marco Mangano and Jacqueline Mangano to Mrs Mary Alafaci which loan was secured by a mortgage over specified real estate; 
        
       2. payment of $10,000.00 inclusive of GST in respect of costs; and 
        
       3. proceedings by Mr Marco Mangano discontinued with no further orders . (No Notice of Discontinuance, although signed, was ever filed. Mr Marco Mangano’s solicitor contended that he handed a signed Notice of Discontinuance to the solicitor for the executors who was to file it. Otherwise the settlement appears to have been implemented shortly prior to Christmas in December 2007.) 
       
      
    12 On 31 August 2007 Mr Grose, an accountant, became the sole director of Pamaja Pty Ltd. 
     
      
    13 On 12 November 2007 Janel lodged an application for the appointment of a financial manager in respect of her grandmother, Mrs Mary Alafaci. The stated basis was that the place of residence of Mrs Alafaci at Rose Bay was on the market for sale and this was contrary to what her attorney stated he would do in the earlier Guardianship Tribunal hearing. 
     
      
    14 Undertakings were given by Mrs Alafaci and Mr Grose, on 7 and 11 December 2007 respectively, that the balance of proceeds of 43 Chamberlain Avenue, Rose Bay, after purchase of an alternative residence, were to be retained pending the outcome of the Family Provision Act proceedings (5491/2006), and that there would be no sale, transfer or other dealing with the shares in Pamaja Pty Ltd and no demand as to monies owed by that company to Mrs Alafaci, pending the outcome of the proceedings. 
     
      
    15 Consequent upon the undertakings, on 19 December 2007, at the request of Janel, the Guardianship Tribunal ordered that the application for a financial management order in relation to Mrs Mary Alafaci be withdrawn. 
     
      
    16 The history of the Family Provision Act proceedings 5491/2006 (“FPA proceedings”) appears to be: 
     
      
       
       a) They were originally listed for hearing on 6 September 2007. 
        
       b) That date was vacated following the commencement of proceedings by two of Mary Alafaci’s grandchildren, Fiona Lane and Anthony Alafaci in proceedings number 4009 of 2007. Those proceedings were resolved at mediation on 17 March 2008. 
        
       c) The claim brought by Paul Mangano in proceedings number 5491 of 2006 was also settled. 
        
       d) The settlement of the claims made by Fiona Lane, Anthony Alafaci and Paul Mangano, including the release of any claim each might have against the future estate of Mary Alafaci, was approved by the Court on 18 April 2008. 
        
       e) Proceedings 5491 of 2006 were on 29 February 2008 set down for hearing on 8 and 9 May 2008, to deal with the outstanding claim of Mrs Janice Mangano. 
        
       f) On 16 April 2008 the solicitors for the remaining plaintiff caused subpoenas to produce documents to issue to Mr M Grose and Pamaja Pty Limited. The subpoenas respectively required the production of details of all bank accounts, statements, leases, loans and records of income and expenses relating to: 
        
         
         i. Antonio Alafaci from 1 January 2005 to date (deceased 19 October 2005); and 
          
         ii. Pamaja Pty Limited from 1 January 2005 to date. 
         
        
       
      
    17 The documents were produced to the Court as required and access was granted to them by a Registrar on 2 May 2008. 
     
      
    18 About 5 or 6 May 2008, Janel arranged with Nicole for her to obtain access to the documents produced on subpoena in her mother’s legal matter. Nicole worked in a legal firm in a junior clerical capacity as a mortgage solicitor’s assistant. This was not the firm acting for her mother in the Family Provision Act proceedings. Nicole procured another junior employee, who worked for the same firm as a clerk/messenger, to have the documents produced on subpoena, uplifted and copied. This second junior employee has never studied law subjects. Nicole told him that there was an estate matter, a family dispute coming up in the Supreme Court within the next couple of days, that some documents had been produced on subpoena and that access had been granted to them. She inquired if he could get (copies of) those documents for her. He said that he got a standard uplifting form and asked her to fill in the details. Unbeknown to the partners and solicitors of the firm employing Nicole, the junior clerk/ messenger arranged for an approved copying firm to uplift and copy the documents which had been produced to the Court on subpoena. The documents so copied were delivered to Nicole on the afternoon of 6 May 2008. 
     
      
    19 At the request of the junior clerk/ messenger Nicole completed the top part of the standard Supreme Court form headed “Application to uplift subpoena pursuant to Practice Note SC Gen 3”. That involved Nicole inserting the number of the proceedings (5491/06) and the name of Janice Mangano as plaintiff and Mary Alafaci as defendant. 
     
      
    20 The details of the packets of documents to be copied were in the handwriting of the junior clerk/ messenger. He must have been told of those details. Whether Nicole knew those details does not appear. He said that the date of “2 May 2008”, being the date when access was granted, is not in his handwriting. It looks like that of Nicole upon a comparison being made of “Mary” and “May” on that form. 
     
      
    21 Underneath “(2) Date Access Granted: 2 May 08”, the following appears: 
     
      
       
        
        “All documents copied by the specified firm and forwarded to me will be used for the purposes only of the proceedings in which they have been produced to the Court. 
         
         
        Except with the leave of the Court, I will not, otherwise than for the purpose of the proceedings, divulge, communicate or refer to any person any information obtained from inspection of any document or thing so produce (sic) to, and inspected by, me, unless it is admitted into evidence in the proceedings.” 
        
       
       
      Underneath is a box headed “Details of person making the request”. As completed by the junior clerk/ messenger the request appears to have been made by the solicitor for the plaintiff. That was incorrect. 
       
       
      There then appears the name of the junior clerk/ messenger, the name of his firm, apparently his mobile telephone number and his signature. He arranged for the approved copier to invoice Nicole. 
       
      
    22 The junior clerk/ messenger believes that Nicole first raised the matter of obtaining copies of the documents urgently with him on 5 May 2008 and that the matter was pursued with and by him on 6 May 2008. 
     
      
    23 Late on Tuesday 6 May 2008 (22:37), an email application was submitted in the name of Marco Mangano from the IP address 58.108.167.36 to the Guardianship Tribunal, which marked it as received on 7 May 2008. The Applicant was shown as Marco Mangano and the application sought the appointment of “financial manager only”. Janel is shown as “Other interested person 1”. The basis of the application is stated as: 
     
      
       
        
        “Son who is a former bankrupt has now obtained credits cards and store credit cards in which my grandmother is paying for and being taken advantage of.” 
        
       
       
      In response to a subsequent question this is stated: 
       
       
        
        “This matter has been brought to the guardianship tribinal (sic) previously and a financial manager was appointed and this manager is doing this job as we have evidence of this management (sic).” 
        
       
       
      Under the heading “Immediate Threat” this appears: 
       
       
        
        “My uncle who is a (sic) ex bankrupt has store credit cards and bank credit cards given to him and paid for by my grandmother. 
        
       
       
        
        PLEASE CONTACT ME ASAP AS THIS IS AN URGENT MATTER.” 
        
       
      
    24 About 4:01 pm on 7 May 2008, an email in the name of Marco Mangano, using the same internet address from which the application was transmitted, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Please find attached evidence in relation to financial abuse of Mary Alafaci.” 
        
       
      
    25 Most, if not all, of the supporting documents enclosed were identical with those produced on subpoena by Michael Grose and Pamaja Pty Limited (see pp 145 – 187 of Exhibit A). There was a substantial contest as to who had sent the email at 4.01 pm and whether Mr Marco Mangano had authorised or permitted its despatch and the accompanying documents. 
     
      
    26 On 8 May 2008 Janice’s FPA application was settled. See Short Minutes of that day. The releases of rights by Janice against the estates of her deceased father, Anthony Alafaci and her mother Mary Alafaci were approved. The orders provided for Janice to receive a large legacy. 
     
      
    27 On 12 May 2008 the Guardianship Tribunal received a spreadsheet (comprising five pages) of payments from 13 May 2006 to March 2008 which it believed was submitted in support of Mr Marco Mangano’s application of 6 or 7 May 2008. 
     
      
    28 On 20 May 2008 the Guardianship Tribunal advised the solicitor for Mrs Mary Alafaci that on 7 May 2008 Mr Marco Mangano made an application to the Tribunal as to his client. By letter of that day the solicitor requested a copy of that application and any related correspondence or supporting material. The Tribunal sent a copy of the application to the solicitor on 30 May 2008 and a copy of the supporting material on 2 June 2008. 
     
      
    29 By request bearing date 10 June 2008 Marco Mangano stated that he wished to withdraw the application concerning Mary Alafaci made to the Guardianship Tribunal for financial management. He wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not want to proceed any further due to family illness.” 
        
       
      
    30 While the plaintiff challenged the date on which the request was stated to be signed, I was not satisfied that the challenge should be upheld. It is true that the Tribunal has stamped the request as received on 11 June 2008. The request could well have been completed on 10 June 2008, sent late that day and recorded as received on 11 June 2008 by the Tribunal. 
     
      
    31 Ms Sue Young, Team Leader at the Tribunal, has recorded on 11 June 2008: 
     
      
       
        
        “P/C this morning (about 9.30) from Marco Mangano. 
         
         
        Said he had both faxed and emailed a request to withdraw his app. 
         
         
        Said because he had sent copies of docs subpoenae’d for another court he was being taken to court by his grandmother and uncle 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        wants to withdraw his application. 
         
         
        Said we would consider it then he would be notified by mail if GT consents to his withdrawal.” 
        
       
       
      (The Tribunal on 10 July 2008 ordered that the application for a financial management order in relation to Mrs Mary Alafaci be withdrawn.) 
       
      
    32 The early morning telephone call recorded by Ms Young suggests that the request to withdraw had probably been sent earlier. I have not overlooked that amongst the papers is a copy of an email sent by Marco Mangano on 11 June 2009, recorded as posted at 1.21 pm. The plaintiffs sought to establish that the request was not signed on 10 June 2008 as the Summons and the original statement of charge against Marco, Janel and Janice were filed on 11 June 2009. This does not matter. By the time Marco signed the request he was probably aware that proceedings for contempt were going to be taken against him. 
     
      
    33 There was a dispute between the plaintiffs and the defendants whether these proceedings should be viewed as civil contempt proceedings or criminal contempt proceedings. 
     
      
    34 The plaintiff contended that what was involved was a breach of an undertaking and that this was a civil contempt. Reliance was placed on the judgment of Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525 at pp 530 – 531. 
     
      
    35 The first defendant contended that these proceedings should be viewed as criminal contempt proceedings. He submitted that from the very moment they were instituted they have been instituted and maintained almost entirely for the purpose of punishing the defendants. It was submitted that there was no evidence of contumacious conduct by the defendants. 
     
      
    36 I understood that the second, third and fourth defendants adopted this approach. Reliance was placed upon Hearne v Street [2008] HCA 36; (2008) 325 CLR 125. In Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 107 – 108 the High Court noted the distinction between civil and criminal contempt occasions very great difficulty. However, it is a distinction maintained in ss 101(5) and (6) of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). There is no right of appeal in any proceedings that relate to criminal contempt being a judgment or order by which the person charged with contempt is found not to have committed contempt. 
     
      
    37 In Hearne, at [133] Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the end the appellants departed from any suggestion that all contempts were criminal by supporting the dissenting opinion of Handley AJA that the question whether an appeal lay to the Court of Appeal from the dismissal of proceedings for contempt depended on whether ‘it clearly appears that the proceedings are remedial or coercive in nature’ as distinct from being punitive. The distinction between that which is remedial or coercive on the one hand and that which is punitive on the other corresponds with the distinction between seeking to ensure compliance with the relevant obligation and seeking to punish for past breaches of it. It is a distinction to be applied, as the parties agreed, bearing in mind the need to approach the application of the person seeking the remedies for contempt by reference to its substantial character, not to merely formal or incidental features. On the facts, Handley AJA considered that the purpose was not remedial or coercive, but punitive. On the other hand, the analysis of the facts made by the majority led them to the opposite view.” (citations omitted) 
        
       
      
    38 These Justices thought that the better view was that of the majority in the light of the history as the residents must have perceived it. 
     
      
    39 In the present case when the FPA proceedings concluded on 8 May 2008 all the claims against the deceased’s estate had been resolved. Further, any claims of Marco Mangano, Fiona Lane, Anthony Alifaci, Paul Mangano and Janice Mangano as against the estate of Mary Alafaci had been released. 
     
      
    40 I have earlier summarised the relief sought in the Amended Summons of 5 August 2008. 
     
      
    41 In paragraph 2 of these reasons I have set out the relief which the plaintiffs presently seek. Proceedings C/32576 in the Guardianship Tribunal have been withdrawn. 
     
      
    42 Janice Mangano and Marco Mangano no longer have any interest in the estate of Mary Alafaci. Realistically, they would have little interest in instituting Guardianship proceedings of any kind in respect of Mary Alafaci. Janel and Nicole do not appear to have given any release in respect of any claims they may have against the estate of Mary Alafaci. Whether either Janel or Nicole has sustainable claims against the estate of Mary Alafaci when she dies was not examined in these proceedings. 
     
      
    43 It was submitted by counsel for the plaintiffs that the proceedings as presently pressed were remedial or coercive and not punitive. 
     
      
    44 It was desired by the plaintiffs to put an end to applications being made to the Guardianship Tribunal for orders, including financial management orders, in relation to Mary Alafaci. 
     
      
    45 The plaintiffs relied on the history of guardianship proceedings being commenced in relation to Mary Alafaci (T 130). It was stated that the plaintiffs wanted to put a stop to the ongoing litigation between the plaintiffs and the defendants and stop the use of documents produced on subpoena in the FPA proceedings in Guardianship proceedings. 
     
      
    46 The plaintiffs pointed out that the Guardianship proceedings instituted about 6 May 2008 were started two days before the hearing of the FPA proceedings and not disclosed to the executors of the will of Anthony Alafaci at that hearing. 
     
      
    47 The plaintiffs submitted that the use of the documents produced on subpoena two days before a settlement went into effect without the plaintiffs knowing, at the time the settlement occurred, that the new guardianship proceedings had been commenced should lead the court to make orders having the effect of deterring any further action being taken by the defendants. It was submitted that such conduct shows an attitude to the processes of the Court which should lead to the results the plaintiffs seek. 
     
      
    48 Documents produced to the Court on subpoena should only be used for the purposes of those proceedings unless and until they are admitted into evidence in proceedings in open court or the court grants leave to their wider use. However, I would be reluctant to make orders having the effect of stopping the institution of guardianship proceedings where that course is warranted. 
     
      
    49 The plaintiffs insisted that they were entitled to change their course in preparing their case. This they had done and made their position clear at the start of the hearing. 
     
      
    50 The plaintiffs advanced these reasons in support of their contention that these proceedings were coercive and remedial rather than punitive: 
     
      
       
      a) imprisonment was not being sought; 
       
       
      b) they were seeking a deterrent which is a fine; 
       
       
      c) these parties have only agreed by consent not to use the documents again; 
       
       
      d) this is a contempt not arising out of a personal right of the plaintiffs but of the Court. The Court has a duty to deter other people from using documents in this particular way; 
       
       
      e) by analogy, on the approach of the High Court in paragraphs 133 – 140 of the judgment of three Justices in  
      Hearne v Street. 
       In paragraph [139] those Justices held that there was a real possibility at the time when the contempt proceedings were instituted that, unless the residents had success in those proceedings, the respondents and those acting for them would again breach their obligations arising from the express undertaking or from the “implied undertaking”. Particular reliance was placed on the consideration in [140], namely, “it cannot be inferred from the fact that the residents applied for contempts of court to be dealt with rather than seeking an injunction against the repetition of those contempts that the proceedings were punitive. Their notices of motion left open the possibility of seeking injunctions after the facts were found”. In the present case injunctions are sought. 
       
      
    51 The first defendant, in support of his submission that these proceedings were of the nature of criminal contempt proceedings, relied upon: 
     
      
       
      a) The plaintiffs in their Amended Summons sought the incarceration of the defendants and are still seeking to punish them. 
       
       
      b) the failure of the plaintiffs to identify a coercive order amongst the relief sought. At its highest, the plaintiffs’ case appeared to be if the defendants get horribly punished in these proceedings that will hopefully restrain them in the future; 
       
       
      c) on the day these proceedings were commenced, the application in the guardianship proceedings was withdrawn. There was no ongoing contempt and nothing to purge; 
       
       
      d) the plaintiffs were motivated not to protect the authority of this Court but to stifle the defendants and frighten them from commencing any further guardianship proceedings. The Court should be wary when there was an 87 year-old widow with mental deficiencies. The submissions of the plaintiffs ultimately reveal that the purpose of the contempt proceedings is to stifle future guardianship proceedings. 
       
      
    52 The second, third and fourth defendants also seemed to adopt the approach that these proceedings were criminal in nature and to point up their punitive aspects. 
     
      
    53 There was a practical reason for the difference in approach between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The plaintiffs relied heavily on the inferences the Court should draw from the materials before it, none of the defendants giving evidence and the principles in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298. 
     
      
    54 The plaintiffs contended that, apart from the principle that all charges of contempt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, these were essentially civil proceedings governed by the principles that apply to civil proceedings. This included the rules or principles that govern the admission and use of evidence in civil proceedings, including the application of the principles in Jones v Dunkel. 
     
      
    55 I make these further comments: 
     
      
       
      a) It was reasonable for the plaintiffs, on the filing of the Summons on 11 June 2008, to seek injunctive relief. That relief was refined in the Amended Summons filed 5 August 2008 but the injunctive relief sought in both documents was, in substance, directed to the same end. As the application to the Guardianship Tribunal was withdrawn about 11 June 2008, is the injunctive relief being sought any longer reasonably necessary? There is an absence of acceptable evidence from the various defendants as to their future non-use of the materials produced under subpoena by Mr Grose on his own behalf and on behalf of Pamaja except with the leave of the Court or the consent of the plaintiffs and those producing the documents. In such circumstances, and bearing in mind how the copy documents were originally obtained and later used, it is reasonable for the plaintiffs to seek injunctive relief. 
       
       
      b) The plaintiffs were correct in their contention that it was incumbent upon the Court to protect its processes and deter future breaches of undertakings and obligations. Persons served with subpoenas to produce documents to the Court must be confident that the documents they produce will only be used for the purpose of the particular Court proceedings and will not be used by the person issuing the subpoena or his or her agents for some other purpose, for example, mounting a collateral attack. 
       
       
      c) At the time of the institution of these proceedings the plaintiffs were entitled to fear that there may be further breaches by the defendants of their obligations in relation to the documents produced on subpoena. It does not appear when they learnt of the withdrawal by Marco of his application to the Guardianship Tribunal. 
       
      
    56 At 530 in Witham v Holloway, in the judgment of four Justices, the view was expressed that a civil contempt involves disobedience to a court order or breach of an undertaking in civil proceedings. I take the word “undertaking” to include both an express undertaking, and an “implied undertaking”. I use the phrase “implied undertaking” in the sense that it is an obligation imposed by law and that there is nothing voluntary about it: Hearne v Street at [106], [107] and [108]. 
     
      
    57 At 531 in Witham v Holloway the joint judgment states: 
     
      
       
        
        “The basis of the distinction between civil and criminal contempt is said to lie in the difference between proceedings which are remedial or coercive in the interest of the private individual and proceedings in the public interest to vindicate judicial authority or maintain the integrity of the judicial process.” 
        
       
      
    58 Reference was made to the judgment of Windeyer J in Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan (1965) 112 CLR 483 at 498 – 499 in which he described proceedings for civil contempt as being “used primarily to compel obedience rather than to punish disobedience”. There is a reference to Windeyer J’s description of the nature of the processes used to enforce orders as “primarily coercive or remedial rather than punitive” and the observation that the same distinction is maintained in the United States. 
     
      
    59 When the Summons was filed on 11 June 2008 and the Amended Summons was filed on 5 August 2008 the application of the plaintiffs was substantially punitive. The application sought imprisonment of each of the four defendants and further or alternatively an order for a payment of a fine and further or alternatively sequestration of the estate of each of the defendants and further or alternatively that each defendant be punished. 
     
      
    60 The plaintiffs have now modified the relief they seek, as earlier mentioned, and state that they rely on a civil contempt based on breach of an express undertaking and “implied undertakings”. 
     
      
    61 In my opinion the plaintiffs are entitled to modify the relief they seek. The modifications intimated at the start of the hearing are significant because the proceedings became proceedings for civil contempt and not proceedings for criminal contempt. It was the plaintiffs’ contention that the contempts in question were civil contempts both because of the nature of the contempt itself (a breach of an undertaking to a Court) and because the remedies sought were coercive and remedial, rather than punitive. The plaintiffs are seeking injunctions. However, the plaintiffs are still seeking orders involving “payment of a fine which reflects the seriousness of the contempt, the lack of contrition of the defendants and the desirability of a deterrent.” 
     
      
    62 I proceed on the basis that what is now being alleged is a civil contempt. There is no ongoing contempt. In view of the Guardianship Tribunal’s order of 10 July 2008 and the processes leading to that order, it is most unlikely that the Tribunal will revive the matter of its own accord. 
     
      
    63 Before dealing with the cases against each defendant, I should indicate that the evidence satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt that the four defendants were acting in concert. I formed this satisfaction having regard to the following matters in combination: 
     
      
       
      a) the close family relationship between the four defendants; and 
       
      
     
     
      
      b) the three children supporting the mother in her FPA application – Marco prepared a spreadsheet for use in those proceedings and Janel and Nicole combined to obtain the copies of the documents produced under compulsory court process; 
       
       
      c) Janice, Janel and Nicole lived at 21/26 Admiralty Drive; 
       
       
      d) the compelling time sequence of obtaining copies of the documents produced on subpoena early in the afternoon of 6 May 2008 and the online application late on 6 May 2008; 
       
       
      e) the documents sent about 16:01 hours on 7 May 2008 in the name of Marco Mangano from wdw_constructions@bigpond.com and that this required knowledge of the user name of Marco and of the password to his Optus web mail; 
       
       
      f) the principal place of business of WDW Constructions Pty Limited was shown as 21/26 Admiralty Drive Breakfast Point; and 
       
       
      g) Marco Mangano’s statements recorded by Ms S Young of the Guardianship Tribunal on 12 May 2008 and 11 June 2008. 
       
      
    64 Accordingly, I have taken the view that the actions of one defendant are admissible against the other. See R v Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 at 460G. Masters was a criminal case as to conspiracy. At 463 the Court acknowledged that it has been said that the principle behind the rule was one of authority or agency – Ahern v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 87 at 95. 
     
      
    65 Of course most of the matters listed above have been affirmatively established. This leads to the conclusion that they were acting on behalf of each other. 
     
      
    66 Criminal conspiracy is a special case and care must be exercised in referring to principles applicable in that area. In the present civil proceedings reference can be made to principles of authority to act and principles of agency when dealing with the various acts of the members of the family, consisting of the four defendants. 
     
      
    67 There is no direct evidence from either the plaintiffs or the defendants save the statement of Nicole (Exhibit H). 
     
      
    68 I have to consider the evidence against each defendant in relation to each charge preferred against that defendant. 
     
      
    Case against Nicole (fourth defendant) 
     
      
    69 As against Nicole the plaintiffs relied on both the alleged express undertaking as contained in the standard uplift form and her “implied undertaking” or obligation imposed by law. On 5 and 6 May 2008 she prevailed upon the junior employee/ messenger at the legal firm at which she worked (not being the solicitors for Janice) to have the documents produced on subpoena in her mother’s FPA application copied and delivered to her. 
     
      
    70 As mentioned, she completed the top part of the standard “Application to Uplift Form” inserting the number of the proceedings and the name of the plaintiff and that of the first defendant. She must have told the junior clerk/ messenger of the documents to be copied. He inserted the relevant packet numbers. He signed the form which contained the undertakings earlier quoted and other details earlier identified as being in his handwriting. Once she had inserted the particulars of the proceedings and the date access was granted, he took over completion of the form and delivered it to the copying company. She did not know the process of obtaining copies of document produced on subpoena. I would not have expected a junior clerical employee who worked as an assistant to a mortgage solicitor to know the process, the undertakings required by the standard form nor the obligations imposed by law. Completing the details at the top of the form, even when she wanted copies of the documents made, does not amount to adopting the undertakings in the form. It was not the equivalent of signing the form. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was aware of the terms of the undertaking contained in the standard form. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Nicole (also known as Nicole or Nicola Tremaine) gave express undertakings or that she authorised the junior employee/ messenger to give them on her behalf. 
     
      
    71 However, she was aware that she had set in train a process by which she was to gain copies of documents produced on subpoena to the Court in her mother’s FPA application and that access had been granted by the Court to those documents. In the afternoon of 6 May 2008 she received copies of the documents. Nicole knew that the origins of the material she received lay in the documents produced to the Court in legal proceedings (her mother’s FPA application). She became subject to the obligation which the law imposes commonly described as an “implied undertaking”. 
     
      
    72 In Hearne v Street at [95] and following the three Justices discussed the extent of the “implied undertaking” and held it was an obligation which arises by operation of law. At 109 the Justices remarked: 
     
      
       
        
        “The primary person bound by the relevant obligation is the litigant who receives the documents or information from the other side pursuant to the litigious processes. The implied undertaking also binds others to whom the documents and information are given.” 
        
       
      
    73 At [110] – [111] the three Justices stated that if the principle that the implied undertaking is binding upon anyone into whose hands the discovered documents come if he or she knows that they were obtained by way of discovery did not exist, the “implied undertaking” or obligation on the litigant would be of little value because it could be evaded easily. The same principle applies to documents produced to the Court on subpoena. It is sufficient if the knowledge of the origins of the material in legal proceedings is established. 
     
      
    74 At [118] the three Justices said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellants submitted that there is no reason in principle why the degree of knowledge necessary to sustain a prosecution of a third party for contempt of an undertaking in connection with the production of documents to the court should depend on whether the undertaking was given expressly or by implication. The relevant reason of principle is that while liability in relation to an express undertaking relates to the giving of that undertaking at a particular time and in particular precise terms, varying from case to case, which third parties have very limited means of finding out about, liability in relation to an ‘implied undertaking’ arises in uniform terms in all cases where documents are produced to the court. A key objective factual integer, knowledge of which is necessary to prove liability, is in one case the terms of the express undertaking, in the other the events giving rise to the ‘implied undertaking’ or legal obligation.” 
        
       
      
    75 There is no direct evidence of what Nicole did with the copy documents after receiving them. However, on 7 May 2008 about 4.01 pm copies of such documents were sent by electronic transmission on the face of the email from Marco’s email address to the Guardianship Tribunal. There was evidence that that email was sent from wdw_constructions@bigpond.com using Marco’s web mail. 
     
      
    76 Nicole faces five charges of contempt (as amended) in the alternative: 
     
      
       
       1. between about 6 and 14 May 2008, knowing that certain documents had been obtained under compulsory court process in proceedings 5491/2006, she used those documents for a collateral purpose, namely, she provided them to Marco Mangano to be used to commence and maintain proceedings in the Guardianship Tribunal in relation to Mary Alafaci; 
       
       
       2. in the alternative, between about 6 and 14 May 2008, knowing that certain documents had been obtained under compulsory court process in the Supreme Court proceedings, she used those documents for a purpose not directly connected with the Supreme Court proceedings, namely, she provided them to Marco Mangano to be used to commence and maintain the Guardianship Tribunal Proceedings; 
       
       
        
        (Before amendment the words “or allowed them to be provided” appeared after the words “she provided them” in charges 1 and 2.) 
        
       
       
       3. in the alternative, between about 6 and 14 May 2008, in breach of the undertakings given to the Supreme Court of NSW not to divulge, communicate or refer to any person any information obtained from inspection of any document produced in answer to subpoena issued in the Supreme Court proceedings, she divulged the supporting documents to Marco Mangano; 
       
       
       4. in the alternative, between about 6 and 14 May 2008, in breach of the undertakings, she communicated the supporting documents to Marco Mangano; 
       
       
       5. in the alternative, between about 6 and 14 May 2008, in breach of the undertakings, she referred the supporting documents to Marco Mangano. 
       
      
    77 In their particulars the plaintiffs relied upon the close relationship of each of the four defendants, and the assistance of the daughters to their mother in her FPA claim, the obtaining of the copy documents on the afternoon of 6 May 2008 and the lodgement of the application to the Guardianship Tribunal late on 6 May 2008 by Marco Mangano by email and the correspondence of the documents forwarded by email to the Tribunal on 7 May 2008 about 4.01 pm with those produced to the Court by Mr Grose on his own behalf and that of Pamaja Pty Limited. The evidence supports that summary. 
     
      
    78 The plaintiffs do not rely on any express evidence that Nicole gave Marco the documents but submitted that by implication this was the conclusion to be drawn from the following evidence: 
     
      
       
      a) The copy documents produced on subpoena were received by Nicole on the afternoon of 6 May 2008 and as a result of her concerted efforts to obtain them. 
       
       
      b) The online application form to the Guardianship Tribunal was completed and submitted to that Tribunal at 22:37 on 6 May 2008 from the IP address 58.108.167.36, the IP address of the home computer of Mr Marco Mangano. 
       
       
      c) The copy application form submitted to the Tribunal contains his address, his daytime, after hours and mobile telephone numbers , his fax number and his email address. 
       
       
      d) Under the heading “Why do you think a financial manager is needed?” these words appear: 
       
       
        
        “Son who is a former bankrupt has now obtained credit cards and store credit cards in which my grandmother is paying for and being taken advantage of” 
         
        
       
       See also the words earlier quoted under the heading “Immediate Threat”. 
       
       
      e) The contents of the application suggest that Marco Mangano had copies of the documents produced on subpoena. 
       
      
    79 Nicole must have either provided the copy documents to Marco Mangano or handed them to a person who provided them to Marco Mangano. Exactly what happened does not appear. In the last mentioned event Nicole must have been aware that the documents were to be provided to Marco. All four defendants were interested in the copy documents obtained. While there is no direct evidence that Nicole knew that Marco was going to use them to make an application to the Guardianship Tribunal, that should be inferred from the circumstances. 
     
      
    80 Nicole and Janel were working together to obtain copies of the documents. It was part of their support of their mother in her FPA application. 
     
      
    81 About 4:01 pm on 7 May 2008 copies of the documents were sent by email to the Tribunal. According to the file note of 11 June 2008 of Ms Sue Young of the Guardianship Tribunal, Mr Marco Mangano told her that because he had sent copies of documents subpoenaed for another court he was being taken to court by his grandmother and uncle. That indicates that Marco Mangano had personally sent the documents to the Tribunal or arranged for them to be sent or adopted the documents being sent. I would not take a literal approach to a file note but have regard to the substance of what is stated. 
     
      
    82 The plaintiffs also relied on the company search of 24 April 2009 of WDW Constructions Pty Ltd. That shows that from 12 May 2006 to 27 June 2007 Nicole was a director of and the secretary of WDW Constructions Pty Ltd. Her address was shown as 21/26 Admiralty Drive, Breakfast Point. Since 27 June 2007 the company has been under the control of another person (Stewart Charmaine of Stafford, Queensland). The company’s principal place of business as from 13 February 2007 is shown as 21/26 Admiralty Drive, Breakfast Point. 
     
      
    83 Nicole submitted that there was no evidence showing that she was involved in sending any material to the Guardianship Tribunal and that the most that appears is that she lived at the address which is the principal place of business of the company of which she was previously a director. It should be inferred that the internet site from which material was sent about 16:01 hours on 7 May 2008 was at the residence at 21/26 Admiralty Drive. This is where Nicole lived with her mother and Janel. It should be inferred that Nicole was involved in doing so acting together with her mother Janice and her sister Janel. Nicole had obtained the copy documents. 
     
      
    84 I return to the words of the first charge against Nicole. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she knew that the documents produced to the Court under subpoena, and copied (with the copies delivered to Nicole) were obtained under compulsory court process in proceedings number 5491 of 2006 in this Court and that she used those documents. The charge is that she used those documents for a collateral purpose, namely, she provided them to Marco Mangano to be used to commence and maintain proceedings in the Guardianship Tribunal in relation to Mary Alafaci. 
     
      
    85 In the absence of an order to the contrary, the procedure for photocopy access is governed by Practice Note Supreme Court Gen 3, especially paragraphs 7 and 8. The firm employing Nicole was not authorised to appoint an approved copier as that firm was not representing the plaintiff. The copying was relevantly unauthorised. While there have been significant departures from proper practice, I reiterate that I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Nicole was aware of, or should be taken to be aware of, the terms of the undertakings contained in the standard uplift form or authorised the junior clerk/ messenger to give them on her behalf. 
     
      
    86 The plaintiffs relied upon the “implied undertakings” or the obligations imposed by law upon third parties who gain access to documents produced under compulsory court process. Nicole is in breach of her implied obligation not to make an improper use of the documents (Hearne v Street at [105]). Making collateral use of documents produced under compulsory court process is an improper use (Hearne v Street at [106]). The legal obligation binds third parties (Hearne v Street at [109]). Nicole, a third party, was subject to the “implied undertaking” or legal obligation. 
     
      
    87 The primary reason for Nicole obtaining and having the copy documents was to assist her mother in her FPA application. The evidence justifies the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that Nicole provided the copy documents either personally or by her mother or her sister to Marco Mangano to commence and maintain proceedings in the Guardianship Tribunal in relation to Mary Alafaci. Copies of the documents obtained by Nicole under compulsory court process were lodged with the Tribunal about 16:01 hours on 7 May 2008 from a site located at the residence of Janice, Janel and Nicole, albeit in the name of Marco Mangano. 
     
      
    88 Nicole must be adjudged guilty of contempt as alleged in the first charge against her. All the constituent elements of the first charge have been proved against her beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    89 As the second, third, fourth and fifth charges against Nicole are alleged in the alternative, it is unnecessary to deal with them. 
     
      
    Case against Janel (second defendant) 
     
      
    90 As against Janel Mangano, the plaintiffs relied on the following: 
     
      
       
      a) Janel and Nicole lived at the same address, namely, Unit 21, 26 Admiralty Drive, Breakfast Point. Their mother Janice also lived there. 
       
       
      b) The close family relationship between the four defendants and the three children supporting the mother in her FPA application. 
       
       
      c) In her affidavit of 17 March 2009 in her mother’s FPA application Janel said she had been and was still employed as a law clerk for 36 hours per week. She described herself as a student/ law clerk. She said that she continued to support her mother and father. 
       
       
      I do not accept that as a student/ law clerk it should be inferred that she is familiar with the practice relating to the express undertakings to be given when documents, produced on subpoena to which access is granted, are uplifted and copied. Janel was not aware of the terms of the express undertaking nor should she be taken to be aware of such terms. She would be subject to the “implied undertakings”. 
       
       
      d) Janel was aware that the documents had been produced to the Court on subpoena. She and Nicole cooperated to obtain access to the documents and copies of them. Janel left it to Nicole to attend to the matter. 
       
       
      e) In the application to the Guardianship Tribunal, sent on 6 May 2008 by Marco Mangano, he has shown as “other interested person 1”: 
       
       
        
        “Ms Janel Mangano 
         
        21/26 Admiralty Drive 
         
        Breakfast Point … 
         
        Email: wdw_constructions@bigpond.com” 
        
       
       
       (In answer to the question, “What is their attitude to the application?” the answer given is, “Don’t know”.) 
       
       
      f) The plaintiffs relied on the address of Janel listed by Mr Marco Mangano and particularly on the email address given by him as being that of Janel. 
       
       
       Comment - It is not surprising that Marco Mangano knew the email address of his sister, Janel. It is not unusual for a family member to know the email addresses used by other family members, but, in circumstances where Marco immediately after inserting the email address of Janel writes (or types) that he does not know her attitude to the application he is lodging, the inferences that can be drawn are limited. 
        
       
       
      g) From Exhibit L, the letter of Telstra of 17 April 2009, it appears that: 
       
       
        
        “IP address 121.216.23.67 at 16.00.44 hours … (AEST) 
         
        on 7 May 2008 was allocated as follows -  
         
        User Name: wdw_constructions@bigpond.com 
         
        Account Holder: Joseph Mangano 
         
        Start Time (AEST): 7 May 2009 14:02:01 
         
        Finish Time (AEST): 7 May 2009 16:30:03” 
        
       
       
      h) The email purporting to be sent in the name of Marco Mangano on 7 May 2008 about 16:01 hours to the Guardianship Tribunal, including the annexures, was sent through Mr Marco Mangano’s Optus webmail account, and, for someone other than Marco Mangano to access that account, that person would need to know his user name and password. 
       
       
      i) Mr Urquhart’s evidence that, if you accepted the statement in Telstra’s documents that the IP address 121.216.23.67 was allocated to wdw_constructions@bigpond.com (account holder Joseph Mangano), the email mentioned was sent from that IP address at the time in question. 
       
       
      j) The email record of, and produced by, the Guardianship Tribunal contained these entries, amongst others: 
       
       
        
        “Received from CPE 121-216-23-67.nsw.bigpond.net.au 
         
        (121.216.23.67) by

        Subject: Mary Alafaci – Information Officer – Evidence” 
        
       
       
      k) The compelling time sequence. 
       
      
    91 It has been established that the email sent about 16:01 hours on 7 May 2008 and the attachments were sent in Marco’s name via his web mail from wdw_constructions@bigpond.com and that this required knowledge of the user name of Marco and of the password to his Optus web mail. The principal place of business of WDW Constructions Pty Limted was at 21/26 Admiralty Drive Breakfast Point. 
     
      
    92 One question in the circumstances of the present case is whether Janel was involved in sending the email about 16:01 hours on 7 May 2008. She submitted that there was no evidence of her connection with, or involvement in, the transmission of (copies of) the documents produced on subpoena apart from her residence at a location where the internet site is situated and from which the material appears to have been sent. That understates the strength of the evidence against Janel. 
     
      
    93 The evidence satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that Janel was involved in sending to the Guardianship Tribunal the email and the attachments about 16:01 hours on 7 May 2008 and the use of Marco’s web mail to do so. She was acting in conjunction with her mother, her sister and her brother. 
     
      
    94 I turn now to the five charges against Janel. These charges are in substantially the same terms as those against Nicole. There is some variation in the particulars provided. 
     
      
    95 As to the first charge against Janel, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that between 6 and 14 May 2008 she knew that certain documents (those produced to the Court by Mr Grose on his own behalf and on behalf of Pamaja Pty Limited) had been obtained under compulsory court process in proceedings 5491 of 2006. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Janel used those documents (or copies of them) for a collateral purpose, namely, that Janel was involved in providing them to Marco Mangano to be used to commence and maintain proceedings in the Guardianship Tribunal in relation to Mary Alafaci. 
     
      
    96 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Janel acted in breach of her “implied undertaking”. I am further satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she participated in using the documents (or copy documents) produced on subpoena for a collateral purpose. I am satisfied that all the constituent elements of the first charge against Janel have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    97 Janel must be adjudged guilty of contempt as alleged in the first charge against her. 
     
      
    98 As the second, third, fourth and fifth charges against Janel are alleged in the alternative, it is unnecessary to deal with them. 
     
      
    Case against Marco Mangano 
     
      
    99 The plaintiffs relied upon the following evidence as against Marco: 
     
      
       
      a) At 22:37 on 6 May 2008 Marco Mangano submitted from the IP address 58:108:167:36 an application to the Guardianship Tribunal for the appointment of a financial manager in respect of Mary Alafaci. 
       
       
       He supplied his email address as callistapod@optusnet.com.au.  
       
       
      b) When this application was being prepared Marco had available to him copies of the documents produced on subpoena or an outline of their contents. 
       
       
      c) When Mr Urquhart, a computer forensics technician, attended Mr Marco Mangano’s home on 29 October 2008, he logged onto Mr Mangano’s internet router and identified the live IP address to be 58:108:167:36. 
       
       
      d) Making his user name and password to his Optus web mail account available to Janice, Janel and Nicole to enable them to send, in the name of Marco Mangano, copies of the documents produced to the court on subpoena in proceedings 5491 of 2006 to the Guardianship Tribunal about 16:01 hours on 7 May 2008. (This is based on the evidence of Mr Urquhart and the documentary evidence.) 
       
       
      e) (i) A copy of the email printed out from the email account of Marco Mangano contains these details, amongst others: 
       
       
        
        “Received: from CPE-121-216-23-67.nsw.bigpond.net.au ([121.216.23.67]) by

        Attention: Sue Young 
         
         
        Please find attached evidence in relation to financial abuse of Mary Alafaci. Please contact me on 0410 43 00 58 to discuss. 
         
         
        Kind regards 
         
         
        Marco Mangano” 
        
       
       
       (ii) Mr Urquhart thought this email originated from someone using a computer connected to a Telstra Internet (Bigpond) service with an IP address of 121.216.23.67 and using an Optusnet web mail facility to send the email and that it was very unlikely that the message originated from Mr Marco Mangano’s home or work computers. 
       
       
       (iii) The user name and password of the Optusnet web mail facility of Mr Marco Mangano must have been made available to the sender of the email. 
       
       
       (iv) The mobile telephone number contained in the email is the mobile telephone number supplied by Marco Mangano on the application. 
       
       
      f) The email and attachments sent about 16:01 hours on 7 May 2008 to the Guardianship Tribunal contain references to “Pamaja”. See the Tribunal’s electronic records. 
       
       
      g) The file note on 12 May 2008 of Ms Sue Young, Team Leader at the Guardianship Tribunal records a conversation which took place that morning, in which, in response to the question how did he get the records he sent with the application, he replied that the “accounts had been subpoenaed for another matter to do with his mother – Family Provision Act”. She also records “There is a spreadsheet that had to be supplied to the court showing if the money was spent for Paul, rather than Mrs A. He’ll email a copy of that.” 
       
       
      h) On 12 May 2008 Mr Marco Mangano sent an email to the Guardianship Tribunal which reads, inter alia, “Attached is the spreadsheet as discussed”. The spreadsheet received by the Guardianship Tribunal extends over some six pages and covers the period from 13 May 2006 to March 2008 and shows alleged payments by Mary Alafaci on behalf of her son, Paul Alafaci, of $66,558. 
       
       
      i) On 1 June 2008 at 8.37 pm Mr Marco Mangano sent an email to the Guardianship Tribunal stated to be from “Callista Podiatry [callistapod@optusnet.com.au] stating “I wanted to let you know that the residence at 43 Chamberlain Ave Rose Bay is on the market”. 
       
       
      j) The file note of 11 June 2008 of Ms Young of the Guardianship Tribunal recording that Marco Mangano told her “because he had sent copies of docs subpoenae’d for another court he was being taken to court by his grandmother and uncle”. 
       
      
    100 In his affidavit of 31 October 2008, Mr Noel Atfield has stated that on 7 May 2008 Marco Mangano arrived at his home at Tregear at approximately 3.45 pm and left at approximately 4.30 pm and during the whole of that period Marco Mangano provided podiatry services to Mr or Mrs Atfield. Both of them were patients or clients. Mr and Mrs Atfield do not have a computer in their home. Mr Atfield was not cross examined. 
     
      
    101 This affidavit establishes that Marco Mangano did not personally send the email to the Guardianship Tribunal about 16:01 hours on 7 May 2008 and the attachments. 
     
      
    102 However, it does not establish that he did not arrange for someone else to do so, or did not facilitate their doing so, or did not adopt the sending of the documents. 
     
      
    103 The two statements made by Mr Mangano and recorded by Ms Young on 12 May 2008 and 11 June 2008 respectively are important as he explained where he obtained the records supporting the application. They were copies of documents subpoenaed for another matter – his mother’s FPA application. The statements recorded by Ms Young as being made by Mr Marco Mangano appear to be factually correct. There is little, or no, room for the suggestion that she misunderstood or made a mistake in what she recorded. 
     
      
    104 Marco Mangano also relied on the affidavit of MG Streeter of 27 May 2009 and on the documents produced by the Guardianship Tribunal in response to a subpoena served on the Tribunal by Streeter Law. The purpose of this material was to point to an alternative source that could possibly have been relied on by Marco Mangano. There was one letter from Mr MI Grose of 28 April 2006 which contained information relating to the account of Pamaja Pty Ltd with Citibank for the period 22 August 2005 to 31 March 2006. The other letter of that date contained information relating to a joint account in the names of the late Mr Alafaci and his wife for the period 4 August 2005 to 4 March 2006. Other available materials related to matters ending on 12 July 2007 and principally related to matters at an earlier date. 
     
      
    105 The time sequence is compelling. Copies of the documents are obtained on 6 May 2008 and, later that day, an online application is made to the Guardianship Tribunal. It is described as an urgent matter. The particulars supplied, “Son … has now obtained credit cards and store credit cards … which my grandmother is paying for …” suggest access to the records produced on subpoena. See also the spread sheet sent to the Tribunal on 12 May 2008. 
     
      
    106 There is no substance in the contention that either the initiating application sent on 6 May 2008 or subsequent submissions were possibly not based on the copy documents obtained on 6 May 2008. 
     
      
    107 I reject the submission that there is no evidence that Marco Mangano had access to the copy documents on 6 May 2008 or on 7 May 2008. I also reject the submission that there is no evidence suggesting that Marco Mangano was in any way aware of the events giving rise to the implied undertaking or legal obligation as at 6 May 2008. The evidence as a whole and the statements made by Mr Marco Mangano to Ms S Young and recorded by her indicate that he was aware of the source of the copy documents and was using and relying upon them in the Guardianship proceedings. 
     
      
    108 I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Marco was aware of the express undertaking contained in the standard Supreme Court uplift form, nor that he should be taken to be aware of such terms. He is bound by his legal obligation. 
     
      
    109 As to the first charge against Marco, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that from 6 to 14 May 2008 Marco, knowing that certain documents (those produced under subpoena) had been obtained under compulsory court process in proceedings 5491 of 2006, used those documents for a collateral purpose, namely to commence and maintain proceedings in the Guardianship Tribunal to obtain a financial management order in relation to Mrs Mary Alafaci. In my opinion all the elements of the contempt charged have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. He breached the legal obligation imposed upon him. I have noted that the statements recorded as made by Marco to Ms Young were made on 12 May 2008 and 11 June 2008 and that these were made after 6 and 7 May 2008. There are two observations to be made. First, Marco told Ms Young of the Guardianship Tribunal that the “accounts had been subpoenae’d for another matter to do with his mother – Family Provisions Act”. Secondly, there is the compelling time sequence. I have not accepted that what occurred was merely a coincidence. 
     
      
    110 As the second, third, fourth and fifth charges were alternatives it is unnecessary to deal with them. 
     
      
    111 It was submitted by Marco that, even if the plaintiffs’ case was held to be proved against him, that case amounted to a technical contempt and the Court would, rather than putting the parties to the additional cost of coming back for penalty proceedings, provide no greater relief to the plaintiffs than was obtained in Ainsworth v Hanrahan (1991) 25 NSWLR 155, that is, a bare declaration and that the proceedings be otherwise dismissed with no order as to costs. In my opinion that would not be appropriate in a case where the copy documents obtained in the FPA proceedings were used to support an application to the Guardianship Tribunal. 
     
      
    112 As Marco advised the Tribunal, not later than 11 June 2008 and prior to the institution of these proceedings but after he knew that these proceedings were proposed, that he desired to withdraw his application for a financial management order in relation to Mary Alafaci and the Tribunal on 10 July 2008 ordered that such application be withdrawn, I have had reservations about granting injunctive relief. There is little likelihood of the copy documents being used to institute further proceedings. 
     
      
    113 However, there is no evidence as to what has become of the copy documents. There was no evidence that they had been destroyed and no acceptable evidence as to their future non-use. 
     
      
    114 I will deal with some questions of relief subsequently. I will not deal with matters relating to penalty. 
     
      
    Case against Janice 
     
      
    115 Janice, as the remaining plaintiff in the FPA proceedings 5491 of 2006, was the person to whom the Court granted access to the documents produced on subpoena. She (or her solicitor) was the person (other than the defendants in the FPA proceedings) who could arrange for the documents to be uplifted and copied by an approved copier. The standard uplift form envisages that the solicitor for the plaintiff or a defendant will arrange for the documents to be copied and that the stipulated undertakings will be given on behalf of the party by his or her solicitor. 
     
      
    116 The plaintiffs relied on the following: 
     
      
       
      a) Janice, as the remaining plaintiff, was the only person to have an interest and who had the authority and power to inspect the documents and uplift (and copy) them. 
       
       
      b) In the absence of any evidence from the defendants, the Court can infer that Janice authorised Janel to uplift (and copy) those documents. 
       
       
      c) Janel arranged for the task to be performed by Nicole, who arranged for a co-worker to do that for her, notwithstanding that she, the co-worker and their firm had no interest in the proceedings. 
       
       
      d) Nicole filled in the top part of the standard Supreme Court form (names of parties and the number of the proceedings) and supplied details which the co-worker inserted. Nicole inserted in the form the date access was granted. The details inserted by Nicole were correct. 
       
       
      e) Janice, Janel and Nicole lived at the same address. The copy documents were sent to the Tribunal from that address in the name of Marco. 
       
       
      f) The children of Janice supported their mother in her FPA application. 
       
      
    117 There is no direct evidence that Janice received the copy documents. There is no evidence that she was aware of the steps that Nicole took to obtain copies of the documents, or that Nicole had given any undertakings to the Court, if that be the case, or the terms of any such undertakings. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Janice gave any express undertakings or that she should be taken to have done so. She was not aware of the terms of any express undertaking. She was subject to the obligation not to use the documents for a collateral purpose. 
     
      
    118 There is no direct evidence that Janice was involved in providing the copy documents to Marco. However, it should be inferred that she had access to them. They were obtained by her daughters in the FPA proceedings Janice had instituted to assist in the conduct of Janice’s case. Janice participated in providing the copy documents to Marco and the Tribunal in conjunction with her daughters. This assisted Marco to commence and maintain the Guardianship Tribunal proceedings. There is some evidence (see the note of Ms S Young of 12 May 2008) that Marco prepared a spreadsheet for use in his mother’s FPA application. 
     
      
    119 I would infer that Janice was aware that documents had been produced to the Court by Mr Grose on his own behalf and that of Pamaja Pty Limited, that she had been granted access to them and that it was desired to obtain access to them, copy them and consider them, and that she left it to her solicitor and Janel to arrange to obtain copies of such documents. 
     
      
    120 As to the first charge, there is proof beyond reasonable doubt that between 6 and 14 May 2008 Janice knew that the documents produced under subpoena by Mr Grose and Pamaja Pty Limited to the Court had been obtained under compulsory court process in proceedings in this Court number 5491 or 2006. The evidence also proves beyond reasonable doubt that she used such documents for a collateral purpose, namely, she participated in providing them to Marco Mangano to be used to commence and maintain proceedings in the Guardianship Tribunal in relation to Mary Alafaci. Janice should be adjudged guilty of contempt. 
     
      
    121 It is unnecessary to deal with the second, third, fourth and fifth charges as they were in the alternative. 
     
      
    Generally 
     
      
    122 It was submitted by the second, third and fourth defendants that any contempt which had occurred, and it was not conceded that any had, had been purged or remedied by the withdrawal by Marco of his application for a financial management order. There would no future wrongful use of the documents produced on subpoena. 
     
      
    123 The second, third and fourth defendants also submitted that if a contempt was found it was a technical one. They submitted that no failure of public policy had been disclosed, no correction of the Court’s processes (or of the Tribunal) had been required and no loss had been occasioned to society. There was agreement with the submissions of the first defendant based upon Ainsworth v Hanrahan. It was pointed out that the first plaintiff had not been present at Court at all and that the proceedings appeared to be driven by the second plaintiff. While those statements appeared to be correct, there was no challenge to the retainer of the solicitor or counsel for the plaintiffs. I must deal with the proceedings on the evidence adduced. 
     
      
    124 As earlier mentioned, the plaintiffs relied heavily on Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 and the inferences that could be drawn. Jones v Dunkel was a civil case in which facts had to be proved upon the balance of probabilities. There was a collision between two trucks and the evidence as to the cause of the collision was meagre. There were two defendants, namely the owner of the truck and the driver. The defendant-driver was not called to give evidence. The trial Judge had correctly directed the jury that the evidence given might be more readily accepted because it had been left uncontradicted and that the omission to call the driver as a witness could not properly be treated as supplying any gap which the evidence adduced for the plaintiff left untouched. At 308 Kitto J stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “But what should have been added, and not being added was in the circumstances as good as denied, was that any inference favourable to the plaintiff for which there was ground in the evidence might be more confidently drawn when a person presumably able to put the true complexion on the facts relied on as the ground for the inference has not been called as a witness by the defendant and the evidence provides no sufficient explanation of his absence. The jury should at least have been told that it would be proper for them to conclude that if [the driver] had gone into the witness-box his evidence would not have assisted the defendants by throwing doubt on the correctness of the inference which … I consider was open on the plaintiff's evidence.” 
        
       
      
    125 At 312 Menzies J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… where an inference is open from facts proved by direct evidence and the question is whether it should be drawn, the circumstance that the defendant disputing it might have proved the contrary had he chosen to give evidence is properly to be taken into account as a circumstance in favour of drawing the inference.” 
        
       
      
    126 At 321 Windeyer J pointed out: 
     
      
       
        
        “Unless a party's failure to give evidence be explained, it may lead rationally to an inference that his evidence would not help his case.” 
        
       
       
      Windeyer J recognised at 321 that this principle did not come into operation until enough has been proved against a defendant to warrant a reasonable and just conclusion against him or her, in the absence of explanation or contradiction. 
       
      
    127 There is helpful discussion of the rule in Jones v Dunkel in Cross on Evidence, 7th Aust. Edition, JD Heydon at paragraph 1215, pp 39 – 45. 
     
      
    128 In the present case the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs against each of the second, third and fourth defendants gives rise to a reasonable and just conclusion against each defendant in the absence of explanation or contradiction. Following the words of Abbott CJ in R v Burdett cited by Windeyer J at 321, enough has been proved to warrant a reasonable and just conclusion against each defendant on Charge 1 of the Amended Statements of Charge filed in Court on 28 April 2009. 
     
      
    129 None of the defendants called any one of their number rebutting or explaining the evidence relied upon by the plaintiffs and from which the Court was asked to draw inferences. The conclusion is fairly open that the evidence of each defendant would not have assisted that defendant or any of the other defendants. 
     
      
    130 Charges 3 to 5 appear to be based on the terms of the express undertaking. I have earlier held that each of the defendants was not aware of the terms of the express undertaking contained in the standard uplift form and should not be taken to have been aware of such terms or to have given the undertakings stipulated.  
     
      
    131 Nothing the Court has done prevents further proceedings in the Guardianship Tribunal. However, it is not permissible to use in any such proceedings documents produced on subpoena to this Court in proceedings Equity 5491 of 2006 without the leave of this Court or the written consents mentioned. 
     
      
    Relief 
     
      
    132 I make the following order against each defendant: 
     
      
       
      1. An order that the defendants, and each of them, be restrained from using documents obtained on subpoena and produced to the Court by Michael Grose and the Company Secretary Pamaja Pty Limited during proceedings number Equity 5491 of 2006,  
      sub nom 
       Mangano & Ors v Alafaci & Ors, for any purpose not directly concerned with those proceedings, including, but not limited to, Guardianship Tribunal proceedings no C/32576 – financial management order in relation to Mary Alafaci. 
       
      
    133 I make the following declaration against each defendant: 
     
      
       
      2. Declare that each defendant is guilty of contempt of court in that, for purposes collateral to the proceedings in which they were provided, each defendant participated in furnishing to the Guardianship Tribunal copies of documents produced on subpoena to this Court in proceedings Equity 5491 of 2006 by Michael Grose and Pamaja Pty Limited, knowing that such documents had been obtained under such compulsory court process. 
       
      
    134 I stand over the further hearing as to penalty as against each defendant and the question of costs on a day to be appointed.

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, CW, was charged on indictment that on or about 25 November 2007 at Woolooware in the State of New South Wales he did murder Christopher Charles Leicester. 
     
      
    2 In the alternative, he was charged on the indictment that on or about that date, he did feloniously slay Christopher Charles Leicester. 
     
      
    3 The offender entered not guilty pleas to each charge and a trial by a jury commenced on Monday 6 July 2009. The hearing of the proceedings continued until 16 July 2009, on which date the jury retired to consider its verdict. 
     
      
    4 On 29 July 2009, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the manslaughter count. 
     
      
    5 The sentencing hearing took place on 18 September 2009. 
     
      
    6 The offender gave evidence during the course of the trial and at the sentencing hearing a large number of documents were tendered:-

      (1) Factual matters 
       
      
    7 The evidence called in the Crown case established that the offence occurred shortly after 11.00 pm on 24 November 2007. 
     
      
    8 The Crown case in relation to the alternative count was brought upon the basis that the offender was guilty of the offence of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. The Crown alleged that he was a party to a joint criminal enterprise. 
     
      
    9 It was made clear in the opening address for the Crown that the Crown case was that the offender participated in a joint criminal enterprise which was said to have been spontaneous, in that there was no evidence that there had been any pre-planning. 
     
      
    10 The Crown called evidence from a number of persons who were present at Woolooware Oval on the evening in question. 
     
      
    11 The offender, CW, was the driver of a vehicle. He and others, including his co-offenders, drove to Woolooware Oval. When he arrived there, his two co-offenders ran ahead onto the oval. One of their friends, Mr Taylor Martin, and the offender, CW, soon after got out of the car. CW then walked across the oval. 
     
      
    12 The Crown called a number of witnesses to establish the events concerning the particular circumstances of the assaults that took place. One witness, Ms Emileen Anderson, recalled seeing Mr Leicester lying on the ground. She jumped onto the co-offender, DGP, in an apparent attempt to stop him from continuing the attack. They both fell to the ground. She said she did it because she thought that DGP was going to attack Mr Leicester. She said she saw DGP kick Mr Leicester once on the ground. Her evidence was that she knew the offender, CW, before the evening of 24 November 2007. She said she recalled when Mr Leicester was on the ground and the offenders were walking away, the offender, CW, said, “Stay on the ground, it’s where you belong”, or something along those lines. 
     
      
    13 Ms Sarah Allen was called by the Crown. She said that, as she walked closer to where Mr Leicester was lying the ground, she saw:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… five boys, silhouettes of boys, men, standing over him. They were kicking around his hip and up around his neck as well, or up around his shoulder blade. Because he was rolling over trying to get away from them. And then after that, as I started walking a bit closer, I saw a man a young man came in and kick him in the neck, around the neck and head area.” 
        
       
      
    14 She then gave a description of the person she saw kick Mr Leicester. She said that she witnessed three kicks delivered by that person. On the last kick she said “I heard a loud crack”. 
     
      
    15 When asked what happened to Mr Leicester, she said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I run over and when I got there, first of all there was a girl leaning over him, trying to push all the guys away. And when I knelt down to, you know, see if his heart was beating, and I knelt down and then the guy with, like the same clothing, the guy that kicked him, came up behind me over my shoulder and started yelling at him.” 
        
       
      
    16 Ms Allen said that she could not recall what he had said. 
     
      
    17 The offender’s account in evidence was to the effect that, not only did he not kick or assault Mr Leicester, but that he, in fact, grabbed his co-offender, DGP, and pulled him back and away from Mr Leicester. He said in evidence that he did not touch, punch or kick Mr Leicester. 
     
      
    18 Mr Andrew Lord, who was also called by the Crown, said that he heard screaming and he looked over and saw Mr Leicester fall. He was then about 20 metres away from him. He saw Mr Leicester on the ground and shaking. His evidence was that he saw three persons involved in assaulting him. He provided descriptions of the assailants in his evidence. The Crown put to the jury that the three persons he saw were, in fact, the offender, CW, and his two co-offenders. The Crown put to the jury that they would reject the offender’s account that he was, in effect, acting as “peace-maker”, that they would not accept CW’s account and that they may consider that the only persons who were trying to stop the fight were the two young women including, in particular, Ms Anderson. 
     
      
    19 It is clear from the jury’s verdict that they rejected CW’s evidence and accepted that given by the Crown witnesses, in particular, the two woman I have referred to. I will return to the significance of the jury’s verdict shortly. 
     
      
       
      (2) Subjective circumstances 
       
       
      (a) The offender’s age 
       
      
    20 The offender, CW, was, as I have stated, 16 years of age at the date of the offence. The question of his youth and level of maturity or immaturity, accordingly, are central matters for evaluation in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed. 
     
      
       
      (b) Evidence of good character 
       
      
    21 I also take into account the evidence as to the offender’s good character, to which I have already referred by reference to the exhibits that were tendered. That evidence, which included character statements and the like, was to the effect that the offender had not previously exhibited aggressive or violent behaviour socially or otherwise, had been a person who had demonstrated sportsmanship as a footballer, was said to have had a sense of humour and exhibited signs of responsibility and otherwise had a good nature. 
     
      
       
      (c) The offender’s personal and family background 
       
      
    22 The offender’s family background and history is recorded in detail in the report from the New South Wales Department of Juvenile Justice dated 9 September 2009 (Exhibit H). 
     
      
    23 He is one of five children and the family migrated to Australia in 1998 when the offender was approximately six years of age. He is recorded as describing a strong relationship with both of his parents and all his siblings. His mother is recorded as reporting that the family had never experienced any problems in relation to his behaviour and that during his childhood and adolescence both the offender and his mother reported that it was unremarkable with no exposure to violence. 
     
      
    24 He is described as a talented sportsperson and commenced his secondary schooling in 2004 and remained enrolled until the date of his admission to custody on 25 November 2007. 
     
      
    25 The first three years of his schooling were said to be without incident and he was well behaved. However, in 2007, CW was noted as presenting with some behavioural concerns. In that year, he received a 20 day suspension for his involvement in a violent altercation with a student from another school, although the offender stated that the altercation resulted from a conflict between one of his peers and another young male and that he, the offender, was one of eight young people involved in the incident and was not the main protagonist. 
     
      
    26 In October 2007, the offender’s parents received a letter from the school which stated that he was being considered for expulsion due to his failure to apply himself to his school studies and meet mandatory course requirements. The expulsion did not eventuate as he was admitted into custody soon after the letter was issued. 
     
      
    27 In relation to alcohol and other drugs, the report records the offender stating that he first experimented with alcohol at the age of 15 and that this was within the family home but says that alcohol is not consumed within the home excessively. In addition, he was recorded as drinking alcohol socially with his peers and maintained that he would drink with his peers “approximately once per fortnight”. 
     
      
    28 The report records the offender’s mother’s statements to the effect that she had never experienced any significant concerns in relation to her son’s use of alcohol or other illicit substances. 
     
      
    29 According to the report, the focus of the intervention in relation to the offender’s self referral to an Alcohol and Other Drug counsellor was around his historical use of alcohol, harm minimisation strategies and the relationship between what is said to be his “alcohol use and his behaviour and relapse prevention strategies” (p.5). 
     
      
    30 The report from the Department of Juvenile Justice records that the offender maintained that, at the time of the offence, he was not under the influence of alcohol or any other illicit substances. I note that his evidence at trial was that he had not consumed alcohol on the night of the offence. 
     
      
       
      (d) Programmes in custody 
       
      
    31 The report from the Department of Juvenile Justice details the offender’s participation in school and therapeutic based programmes whilst he has been in custody. It is said that he completed a general educational course, which is equivalent to the School Certificate, as well as other courses. He is presently undertaking a Certificate Four course in Hospitality. He is reported as consistently displaying positive behaviour whilst attending the custodial based school and interacts with teachers and other students. 
     
      
    32 He has completed other courses and obtained certificates including a First Aid Certificate and he has engaged in a music programme, an Alcohol and Other Drug Core Programme and anger management. 
     
      
    33 Whilst in custody, he has also continued to involve himself in sport, including football. 
     
      
    34 The report from the Department of Juvenile Justice states that the offender has been compliant and has been constructively engaged in the various courses that he has undertaken and has maintained a positive attitude towards his present position. It stated that he comes from a stable and supportive living environment with strong family ties and supports. The report commends him for having utilised his time in custody to continue to focus on his education and well-being. Should he remain in the juvenile justice system, the report states (at pp.6-7):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… he would be afforded continued opportunities to access appropriate treatment programmes as well as educational and vocational programmes provided by this Department.” 
        
       
       
      (3) Submissions on behalf of the offender 
       
      
    35 Mr J Spencer of counsel submitted that there was no premeditation or planning by his client in relation to the offence. In this respect, he referred to the basis upon which the Crown had stated that the joint criminal enterprise was a spontaneous one and that there was no intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. Mr Spencer stated that this was borne out by the facts associated with the events that led up to the attack on Mr Leicester. 
     
      
    36 Mr Spencer also submitted that there was no basis for finding that the offender, CW, was the instigator or “the dominant figure in these events”. He submitted that, consistent with the jury’s verdict, he joined the joint enterprise after the initial attack. 
     
      
    37 Mr Spencer relied upon both the fact that his client had no prior convictions and, additionally, that he was a person of good character. 
     
      
    38 In addition, Mr Spencer noted that there was no weapon used in the attack. 
     
      
    39 Emphasis in the submissions was placed upon CW’s age as at the date of the offence (16 years and two months) and that this, of itself, indicated that he must have been “somewhat immature”. Whilst not suggesting that it was immaturity that caused his client to be involved, his age, Mr Spencer submitted, was nonetheless something to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed. 
     
      
    40 Mr Spencer relied, in particular, on the report from the Department of Juvenile Justice (Exhibit H) to which I have already referred. He stated that it was evidence of a constructive approach made by his client whilst in custody and that he had expressed remorse and acknowledged the impact of his behaviour on his own family. Mr Spencer observed that, bearing in mind his plea of not guilty, he was not able to further develop the question of remorse. 
     
      
    41 Reliance was also placed upon what was said to be the strong support from his family who were a well-respected family. 
     
      
    42 The offender himself, he observed, did not suffer from any psychological or psychiatric impairment and had been a talented sportsperson, involving himself in rugby league football. 
     
      
    43 Mr Spencer also emphasised the offender’s good behaviour whilst in custody. 
     
      
    44 Mr Spencer submitted that the evidence supported the fact that his client had excellent prospects of rehabilitation and that he was taking every opportunity to maximise those prospects. 
     
      
    45 It was submitted that, in determining sentence, there was no evidence that the offender required “a specific deterrent” (transcript, p.51). 
     
      
    46 In relation to the offence and to CW’s participation in it, Mr Spencer submitted that, whilst Ms Allen stated that she saw Mr Leicester being kicked three times, it would have been open to the jury and equally consistent for the jury to have found that he did kick Mr Leicester but not necessarily three times. 
     
      
       
      (4) Submissions on behalf of the Crown 
       
      
    47 The Crown submitted that, for the jury to have reached its verdict, they must have concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the offender, CW, kicked the deceased whilst he lay on the ground. That, the Crown observed, was the only basis that it put its case of participation by the offender, CW, in the joint criminal enterprise to the jury. It is clear that that submission is well founded. 
     
      
    48 In the Crown’s written submissions (p.6), reference is made to the evidence, in particular, that given by Ms Allen as to the kicking she said she observed. Reference was made to her having seen Mr Leicester lying on the ground on his back. She was about six to seven metres away with an unobstructed view. She saw a young man come in and “kick him in the neck, around the neck and head area” (transcript, p.187). She provided a description of the young man. 
     
      
    49 Reference was then made to the fact that she said she saw three kicks by the young man, the last of which was accompanied by the sound of a loud crack, as I have earlier noted. When she knelt down to try to attend to Mr Leicester, the person who she had seen kicking came up over her shoulder and started yelling at him. 
     
      
    50 The Crown submission was that I would conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the offender, CW, kicked the deceased three times whilst he was on the ground, one of those kicks was to the neck/head area and the last kick was accompanied by “a loud crack” noise which a number of witnesses heard. I consider that submission to be well founded. Dr Botterill had expressed the opinion that the wound associated with the loud crack occurred when the fracture to the cheekbone occurred. Such a fracture would require moderate to severe force. 
     
      
    51 The Crown finally submitted:- 
     
      
       
        
        “This was a cowardly attack by this offender on a young man who lay defenceless on the ground and objectively is extremely serious.” 
        
       
       
      (5) Conclusions on objective circumstances of the offence and CW’s participation in it 
       
      
    52 It was clear from the verdict, as I have previously stated, that the jury accepted the evidence given by Ms Anderson and accepted the evidence given by Ms Allen and that of Mr Lord and that the jury rejected the evidence of the offender. 
     
      
    53 It is implicit in the jury’s verdict, accordingly, that they did find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender, CW, kicked Mr Leicester whilst he lay on the ground in a seriously injured condition, that is, after he had been punched and kicked by DGP. There is no reason to accept that the jury did not accept Ms Allen’s evidence to the effect that Mr Leicester was kicked three times, including at least once to the head/neck region, as described in evidence. 
     
      
    54 The evidence plainly established a most serious assault by the offender, CW, in the joint criminal enterprise in question. The objective seriousness of that offence is marked out, in particular, by the fact that Mr Leicester was in an entirely defenceless and highly vulnerable position from the outset and more so once he had been injured and knocked to the ground by the offender, DGP. Additionally, the force and the multiplicity of the attacks (including to the victim’s head/neck region) increased the gravity CW’s the offending behaviour. 
     
      
    55 It is clear from the evidence, and I so find, that the level of violence arising from the offender CW’s actions was of a high order. His actions in kicking Mr Leicester were severe and ferocious and were capable of, and did in fact inflict, significant physical injury on Mr Leicester. It is more than apparent that, in so acting, with Mr Leicester lying on the ground already injured, the offender displayed a level of callousness and cowardice that must be abhorred in any civilised society. 
     
      
       
      (6) Manslaughter sentencing principles 
       
      
    56 The maximum penalty for manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment: s.24 of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    57 Determining a proper sentence for manslaughter is notoriously difficult given the variety of circumstances in which the offence can be committed: Regina v Green [1999] NSWCCA 97 at [24]. Some assistance can be gained from a consideration of the facts and sentencing outcomes of other cases. However, these do not determine an inflexible range. They can only provide general reference points. Similarly, little assistance is to be gained from sentencing statistics which encompass all forms of manslaughter: Regina v Mohamad Ali [2005] NSWSC 334 at [61]. 58 Spigelman CJ said in Regina v Forbes (2005) 160 A Crim R 1 at [133]–[134]:-  
     
      
       
        
        “… manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence … In its objective gravity it may vary, as has been pointed out, from a joke gone wrong to facts just short of murder.  
         
         
        It is also relevant to recognise that, although manslaughters can be characterised in different ways, particularly in the various contexts which may reduce what would otherwise be a murder to manslaughter, the degree of variation within any such category is generally also over a wide range. Matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter 
        .” 
        
       
      
    59 Nevertheless, it is important to bear in mind the denunciatory role of sentencing for the offence of manslaughter: Regina v MacDonald (unreported, NSWCCA, 12 December 1995). The offence involves the felonious taking of human life, and whatever form it takes, it has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime. The protection of human life is a primary objective of the system of criminal justice, which is reflected in the community’s expectations of that system. 
     
      
      (7) Manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act 
       
      
    60 Manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, involving an appreciable risk of injury of serious injury, is a category of involuntary manslaughter. Involuntary manslaughter, unlike murder, does not require proof of intent to cause death or grievous bodily harm to the victim, nor the other mental elements necessary for murder: The Queen v Lavender (2005) 222 CLR 67 at 70.  
     
      
    61 The physical element is the unlawful and dangerous act which causes death. The mental element concerns that act, in that the act must be willed and not accidental: Wilson v The Queen (1991-92) 174 CLR 313 at 328. The only relevant intent is that required to do the act, and that the act inadvertently caused death: Lavender (supra) at 82-83. To be found guilty of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, the circumstances must be such that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have realised that he or she was exposing another or others to an appreciable risk of serious injury: Wilson (supra) at 332-4; Regina v KT [2007] NSWSC 83.  
     
      
    62 It has been said that there is no hierarchy of seriousness between voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. Spigelman CJ said as much in Regina v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 183 at [29]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Even a case where there is present an intention to kill or maim, which would constitute murder but which is reduced, by reason of provocation or diminished responsibility, to a charge of manslaughter, will not necessarily attract a higher sentence than other forms of manslaughter, including the relevant one here, ie, killing by an unlawful and dangerous act. As a five judge bench of this Court, including Gleeson CJ, Mason P, Hunt CJ at CL, Simpson and Hidden JJ, said in  
        R v Issacs 
         (1997) 90 A Crim R 587 at 595:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The argument for the appellant advanced on this appeal appeared to assume that a case of provocation manslaughter is necessarily, or at least ordinarily, worse that  
          [sic]  
          a case of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. We do not accept that. Each case depends upon its own circumstances. The range of sentencing available in the case of manslaughter is notoriously wide. There have been cases where provocation manslaughter has resulted in non-custodial sentence.” 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (8) The sentencing discretion 
      
    63 In determining the sentence in the present case, I am required to consider the objective and subjective factors relevant to the offence and the aggravating and mitigating factors in accordance with the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and relevant sentencing principles. I am required by law to take account of a number of matters in determining the objective gravity of the offence committed by the offender and the other matters to which I have referred. The sentence to be imposed is one that is appropriate to the particular crime, having regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively: Regina v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. 
     
      
    64 It is important to note that the offence was committed in company and this is an aggravating factor within s.21A(2)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. On the night in question, the offenders, DGP and PB, were passengers in a vehicle driven by CW. As the vehicle drove past Woolooware Oval, a man shouted something in the direction of the vehicle. CW stopped the vehicle next to the oval. DGP and PB exited the vehicle and ran onto the oval, followed by CW. Together, they approached the deceased and his friend, Parkes. The assault then occurred in the manner I have described earlier. Clearly, the deceased was confronted by the combined force or strength of two or more persons, and indeed, the forces of two or more people were deployed against him: Regina v Brougham (1986) 43 SASR 187 at 191; Regina v Leoni [1999] NSWCCA 14 at [16]; Regina v Villar and Zugecic [2004] NSWCCA 302 at [68].   
     
      
      (9) Victim Impact Statements 
       
      
    65 A sentencing judge’s approach to victim impact statements (from the family of a deceased victim) can only be accepted within the confines laid down by Regina v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 96; Regina v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510 at 529-530; Regina v Tzanis [2005] NSWCCA 274 at [15]-[18] and Whybrow v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 270 at [17]. 
     
      
    66 Victim impact statements are received and considered for the purposes of s.28 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Section 28(3) provides that a Court must receive a victim impact statement given by a family member and acknowledge its receipt, and may make any comment on it that the Court considers appropriate. 
     
      
    67 It was observed by Johnson J in Regina v SBF (supra) at [88] “… There is no requirement for victim impact statements to be referred to in some shorthand way …”. 
     
      
    68 In the present case, the impact statements made by Mr Leicester’s mother, father and sister each recorded clearly and poignantly the devastating consequences that the death of their son and brother has had upon each of them as a result of the offence committed by the offenders. One of the purposes for which a Court may impose a sentence on an offender I note is “to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community”: s.3A(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    69 I am conscious of the limitations upon the use of the victim impact statements, in particular, those flowing from the Privitera principle governing the use of such material and in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed I, of course, proceed in accordance with that principle. 
     
      
    70 The impact of crimes of homicide in cases such as the present as revealed by victim impact statements remind both judges who are dealing with such cases on a not infrequent basis and the community of the appalling and devastating loss and distress that results from violent crimes leading to death including, in particular, those senseless crimes of random violence involving innocent citizens. (10) Sentencing offenders involved in a joint criminal enterprise 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    71 A joint criminal enterprise exists when two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime: McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108 at 114. The understanding or arrangement need not be express and may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached at any time before the crime is committed. The circumstances may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then and there to commit that crime: Regina v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 at 556. 
     
      
    72 If one or other of the parties to the understanding or arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime, they are all equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission. 
     
      
    73 A person participates in a joint criminal enterprise either by committing the agreed crime itself or simply by being present at the time when the crime is committed, and (with knowledge that the crime is to be or is being committed) by intentionally assisting or encouraging another participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit that crime: Tangye (supra) at 557. The presence of that person at the time when the crime is committed and a readiness to give aid if required is sufficient to amount to an encouragement to the other participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime.  
     
      
    74 Despite each party to a joint criminal enterprise being equally liable, it will often not be appropriate to give each party the same sentence. As Gibbs CJ explained in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal, and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender, and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence, have to be taken into account 
        .” 
        
       
      
    75 To such end, the role each offender plays in an offence of manslaughter is crucial to assessing their respective culpability: Lowe (supra) at 609; Regina v Howard (1992) 29 NSWLR 242; Carruthers v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 276. The examination of the facts extends to the level of participation in the physical acts that caused death: Regina v Mamae [2001] NSWSC 936; Howard (supra); Regina v Tan [2007] NSWSC 684; Carruthers (supra).  
     
      
    76 The relevant evidence in this case is the evidence that was given at trial.(11) Sentencing juvenile offenders 
     
      
    77 The offender CW was, as I have earlier stated, aged 16 years at the time of the offence and he is now aged 18. Section 3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act defines child as any person under the age of 18 years and, accordingly, the offender stands to be sentenced in accordance with the provisions of that Act.  The offence of manslaughter is a serious children’s indictable offence and, accordingly, the offender is required to be dealt with according to law (s.3, s.16 and s.17, Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act).78 Section 6 of that Act provides legislative guidelines in the exercise of criminal jurisdiction with respect to children:-  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        A court, in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children, shall have regard to the following principles:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them, 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance, 
        
       
       
        
        (c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption, 
        
       
       
        
        (d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home, 
        
       
       
        
        (e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind.” 
        
       
      
    79 Accordingly, I must have regard to these principles in sentencing the offender. 
     
      
    80 In KT v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 51, McClellan CJ at CL set out the relevant principles in sentencing young offenders. In that case, his Honour referred to the principles enunciated in s.6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. His Honour stated at [22]:-  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        22. The principles relevant to the sentencing of children have been discussed on many occasions. Both considerations of general deterrence and principles of retribution are, in most cases, of less significance than they would be when sentencing an adult for the same offence. In recognition of the capacity for young people to reform and mould their character to conform to society’s norms, considerable emphasis is placed on the need to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        23. The law recognises the potential for the cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity of a young person to contribute to their breach of the law. Accordingly, allowance will be made for an offender’s youth and not just their biological age … The weight to be given to the fact of the offender’s youth does not vary depending upon the seriousness of the offence … Where the immaturity of the offender is a significant factor in the commission of the offence, the criminality involved will be less than if the same offence was committed by an adult … 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        25. … The emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders, may be moderated when  
        the young person has conducted him or herself in the way an adult might conduct him or herself and has committed a crime of violence or considerable gravity  
        … In determining whether a young offender has engaged in ‘adult behaviour’ … the court will look to various matters including the use of weapons, planning or pre-meditation, the existence of an extensive criminal history and the nature and circumstances of the offence … Where some or all of these factors are present the need for rehabilitation of the offender may be diminished by the need to protect society. 
        
       
       
        
        26. The weight to be given to considerations relevant to a person’s youth diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity ... A ‘child-offender’ of almost eighteen years of age cannot expect to be treated substantially differently from an offender who is just over eighteen years of age ... However, the younger the offender, the greater the weight to be afforded to the element of youth…” 
         (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    81 Crimes of violence committed by young offenders have been the subject of particular attention by the Court of Criminal Appeal and single judges of this Court in recent years. 
     
      
    82 Whether or not there has been an acceleration in the incidents of unprovoked violent crimes by young male offenders (and there is some evidence to suggest that it has), young offenders who do engage in crimes of violence that culminate in the death of an innocent victim, may expect sentencing courts to impose substantial sentences that adequately reflect the need for general deterrence in the community. 
     
      
    83 In KT (supra), McClellan CJ at CL at [25] observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders, may be moderated when the young person has conducted him or herself in the way an adult might conduct him or herself and has committed a crime of violence or considerable gravity ... ” 
        
       
      
    84 In KT (supra), the sentencing judge (Johnson J) (the appeal against sentence was dismissed by majority) dealt with an offender who was 16, almost 17 at the time of the offence, involving a very powerful blow by him to the victim. The single punch in that case resulted in the death of the victim, entirely innocent citizen who had simply been unfortunate enough to be walking along a public street when the unprovoked confrontation occurred. Johnson J observed (at 118):- 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, the factors of punishment and deterrence are significant factors on sentence on this case. General deterrence is an important factor in this case. Young persons must be made aware that vulnerability of human beings require restraint by others and a rejection of unprovoked violent assaults … This was an objectively serious offence committed by a young man living in an adult world. Although the provisions of s.6 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and sentencing principles with respect to young offenders remain relevant, it is appropriate in this case to reflect on the sentence the elements of punishment and deterrence which must not be subsidiary to the rehabilitation of the offender.” 
        
       
      
    85 The present case is another instance of an innocent citizen being set upon, in entirely unprovoked circumstances, and subjected to a high level of explosive violence by young males, in some cases, acting together in a joint criminal enterprise. 
     
      
    86 In cases such as this, there is a need in sentencing for there to be a proper accounting for all relevant factors and a sentence that reflects them. General deterrence is one such factor. General deterrence, it has long been recognised in sentencing law, sends a message out to the community that those engaging in conduct of the kind involved in the present case being criminal conduct and produces fatal consequences, can expect such offending to be addressed by substantial terms of imprisonment. 
     
      
    87 In KT (supra), McClellan CJ at CL observed (at [41]):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… there is considerable force in the view that, notwithstanding the youth of the offenders, the decisions of the courts for this type of offence have provided a range of penalty which fails to adequately reflect the need for general deterrence and retribution. The recent experience of this Court indicates that the range of penalties imposed on young offenders who commit random acts of violence resulting in death may not have been sufficient to deter others from similar irresponsible criminal behaviour. In my opinion although the circumstances of an individual offence and offender must always be considered, this Court should in future accept that more significant penalties may be required when sentencing offenders for this type of offence.” 
        
       
       
      (12) Special circumstances: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       
      
    88 In sentencing the offender, CW, I am required to apply the provisions of s.44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and determine the non-parole period in accordance with its provisions unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances for varying the prescribed statutory ratio of non-parole to parole periods. See Regina v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. 
     
      
    89 In the case of CW, I take into account his age, his lack of criminal antecedents and that he is and will be serving his first period in custody and I have, in addition, considered the evidence bearing upon his prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    90 I have earlier recorded his participation in educational and other courses and his expression of interest in furthering his education on his release from custody. He has a supportive family and the therapeutic interventions available to him to date suggest that continued support will assist his rehabilitation. I consider that these matters, taken in conjunction, do constitute special circumstances for the purposes of s.44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and I so find. 
     
      
       
      (13) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 
       
      
    91 In relation to CW, I have had regard to the provisions of s.19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. The Crown submitted that special circumstances do not exist for the purposes of those provisions. 
     
      
    92 I have had regard to both the Juvenile Justice report (Exhibit H) and to a more recent Juvenile Justice report dated 19 October 2009, which, by leave, was produced and made available as part of the sentencing materials after the sentencing hearing. I have marked that report as Exhibit O. 
     
      
    93 It is clear from the evidence that, in 2007, CW was having difficulty in his schooling having been under threat of expulsion. He was said to be somewhat “impressionable”. The evidence indicates that CW has made progress whilst in the juvenile detention institutions and there is every reason to believe that, if he continues in that environment, rather than a prison for adult offenders, he will achieve a successful level of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    94 Although there are facilities available in adult prisons as indicated by Exhibit O, it is important that his progress that CW has made since his confinement in juvenile detention not be disrupted or quite possibly ended by influences he will encounter in an adult prison. It is to be borne in mind, as Exhibit H indicates, that the apparent negative peer influences that operated on him at the time of the offence appear to have played a role in his offending notwithstanding his strong relationship with his parents at that time. 
     
      
    95 I consider CW’s vulnerability to negative influences and to his positive progress achieved whilst in custody and the need to best ensure his prospects of rehabilitation are special circumstances do exist within s.19(4) of the Act such as to justify the making of an order under that section for CW to serve his term of imprisonment as a juvenile offender and I so find. 
     
      
    96 Accordingly, I make an order pursuant to s.19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act that the offender CW serve the whole of his sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender. 
     
      
    97 I note that as the offender CW was convicted at trial, he does not have an entitlement of the Thomson & Houlton discount on sentence, which I have applied to his co-offenders, who entered guilty pleas. 
     
      
       
      (14) Sentence in respect of CW 
      
    98 The offender CW is sentenced to a non-parole period of six years to commence on 25 November 2007 and to expire on 24 November 2013 and to a parole period of three years to expire on 24 November 2016. 99 Accordingly, the first date upon which the offender CW will be eligible for parole will be 24 November 2013.

   JUDGMENT1. I have to sentence a young man named Nazih Zantout for a very serious crime. The crime is called robbery in company. It is made a crime by s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. It is so serious a crime that Parliament has fixed a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment for anyone who commits this crime. 2. It is important for any judge in sentencing an offender to explain briefly what happened in the case so that everyone understands how serious the crime is. The crime was committed on 10 October 2008. A man who worked in a company which recycled car parts had been contacted some days earlier by either Mr Zantout or one of his accomplices. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was Mr Zantout. 3. The man who became the victim was told that someone had a lot of car parts for sale and that he should come to a block of units where he could buy them. Arrangements were made for him to go to an address in Auburn. The man parked his car outside and then one of the co-offenders came outside and asked him to drive his car into the underground car park. The number of car parts which were said to be on sale was very high so the offenders must have expected the man to come with a lot of money. They were right in this expectation. 4. When the victim drove his utility into the car park and started to get out he was challenged by one of the co-offenders who held a ten centimetre knife at the man’s throat. Then two other men appeared. One of them punched the victim in his face. Whilst the knife was still being pointed at him, he was told to hand over the money or he would be killed. 5. It must have been a terrifying experience for this victim. He was alone isolated in the car park with three men, one of whom had a long knife, and he was being threatened with his life. He offered them a $1,000, which was game of him, but the men, as I said, expected that he would have more so they challenged him. The victim wisely produced the rest of the money, which was a further $10,500. All in all he was robbed of $11,500. Not only did they take the money from him but they stole his GPS navigator from his station wagon.6. Luckily someone saw what was going on and rang the police. The offenders ran away. The police saw Mr Zantout and chased him. They finally caught up with him and found the navigator in his pocket and a phone. He was interviewed and charged. Mr Zantout does not have any previous convictions. 7. Mr Gillett who appears for Mr Zantout as his counsel today frankly and realistically acknowledged this is a very serious crime. Mr Gillett called Mr Zantout’s sister, Sarah, who herself is a worker in the criminal justice system and she explained how Mr Zantout is one of five children. There are three girls and a boy, most of them in their twenties; they belong to a strong and supportive family.8. Sarah Zantout said how much change she had seen in her brother since he was arrested last year for this offence. She said that he had not done well at school and in fact her parents had often been called in. She explained that the family only became aware of a particular medical condition which her brother has called Marfan syndrome when they saw a psychiatrist last month concerning this offence. 9. The family all support Mr Zantout and will back him up, whatever happens. He has employment with a brother-in-law as a motor mechanic and is doing a special class in motor mechanics at TAFE. He has strict bail conditions; he was kept in custody for some six days; he has kept a curfew which means that he cannot go out after 8 o’clock at night. He no longer associates with those people that he committed the crime with and his friends are no longer trouble makers. He is, all in all, experiencing much more support now that some of his difficulties have been exposed. Sarah said that his ability to plan is not very good and he needs help with this. 10. In a helpful pre-sentence report prepared by a probation and parole officer, the supportive family upbringing is confirmed. Mr Gillett emphasised the reference to Mr Zantout being influenced a lot by his peers. He acknowledged that what he did was wrong but presented with a lack of insight to the probation officer.11. In addition there is an extensive report from a psychiatrist, Dr Roberts, dated 26 October 2009. Mr Gillett emphasises the diagnosis of Marfan Syndrome and referral of Mr Zantout to a cardiologist. It remains an ongoing issue as far as Mr Zantout’s health is concerned. Dr Roberts noted that there was a significant degree of what he called developmental delay with Mr Zantout’s medical history and that delay has affected his education and behaviour. He further pointed out that such developmental delay can affect a person’s capacity to make sound judgment which is, as the doctor described, significantly compromised. The treatment plan included some limited medication and the developmental delay can be compounded by the presence of Marfan’s syndrome. He also has a shoulder injury which was picked up by, as part of the history, Dr Roberts. Dr Roberts thought that he could be victimised in gaol and was particularly vulnerable. 12. Mr Gillett acknowledge the aggravating features of the case but pointed to some features such as an unlikelihood of re-offending, which I find is the case, and no prior convictions. Mr White who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions does not dispute Mr Gillett’s submission that Mr Zantout pleaded guilty to this charge at the earliest opportunity to him.13. Mr Gillett argued that any prison sentence should be adjusted so that the non-parole period is less than usual. Mr White compared this case with the guideline judgment delivered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 by reference to common elements of this kind of offence. Mr White pointed out that Mr Zantout is a young man with no criminal history; there was a knife involved in the offence; however this offence involved more than a limited degree of planning it was in fact a higher than usual degree of planning and obviously the unfortunate victim was, as Mr White said, lured to the block of units so that he could be robbed at knife point. 14. Mr White went on to say that there was a limited degree of violence, he argued that the victim in this case was in a vulnerable position not because of his employment but because he was placed there by the offenders. I accept that submission. 15. The amount stolen was Mr White argued relatively small although $11,000 is probably a lot more than many people obtain from an armed robbery.16. There was a plea of guilty, in this case it was at the earliest opportunity. The range of sentences for a typical case is between four and five years as a head sentence. Mr White argued that the only appropriate sentence would be a custodial sentence. It could not, he said, be less than two years. 17. This is a difficult case to sentence someone on because it is a such a serious crime but committed by a young man with some significant problems. However, I regard a full-time custodial sentence as inevitable and the question is what that sentence should be. 18. Taking into account the guideline judgment I would regard this case as so serious - given the degree of planning involved - that a head sentence of five years would be appropriate. I appreciate that the guideline judgment includes or assumes a plea of guilty but I am going to, as a benefit to Mr Zantout, discount that head sentence of five years by twenty-five per cent because of his plea of guilty. I want to make the impact of his plea very clear, that would reduce the head sentence to some three years and nine months. Because of the fact that he is significantly affected by developmental delay and, because of this condition, was more liable to be influenced in what he did, I regard the case as one where general deterrence is slightly less important than usual. 19. Accordingly, I have determined that the appropriate overall sentence is one of three years imprisonment. I accept Mr Gillett’s submissions that there are special circumstances which warrant an adjustment in the normal ratio between the non parole period and the head sentence. Those special circumstances include the fact that this will be Mr Zantout’s first significant period of custody and there will need to be some attention to his reintegration into the community including employment when he is released from prison. I regard an appropriate non parole period as one of eighteen months. 20. I am now going to sentence you Mr Zantout, if you would stand up. I set a non parole period for your sentence of eighteen months, to commence today 30 October 2009 and to expire on 29 April 2011. The balance of the term will be eighteen months, to commence on 30 April 2011 and to conclude on 29 October 2012.21. The overall sentence is three years, commencing today 30 October 2009 and expiring on 29 October 2012.22. Under s 50 the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an order directing your release on parole on 29 April 2011. Take a seat Mr Zantout. I will explain things to you in a moment. First are the mathematics correct? I think they are. WHITE: Yes, they are correct. Did your Honour allow for the six days?HIS HONOUR: I am going to say something about that, yes. The second thing is whether conditions of parole, because I am fixing parole, obviously good behaviour. I am not sure that he needs supervision because the probation report thinks he is unlikely to need supervision and he has a strong family. He has been to see a doctor.GILLETT: Usually your Honour just makes an order that he be subject to the usual orders under the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act. That is all in my submission.HIS HONOUR: But I think I need to fix conditions of parole, don’t I because I am ordering his release on parole, it is not the Parole Authority.GILLETT: No you are probably right, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Because it is me doing it, because his sentence is three years.GILLETT: Yes, your Honour is right.WHITE: I think that is right your Honour and perhaps if your Honour just simply sets a condition--HIS HONOUR: A good behaviour is one condition.WHITE: Yes, your Honour and that he be supervised by Probation and Parole for as long as that Service deems necessary.HIS HONOUR: All right, okay.23. Conditions of parole will be: 1. That he be of good behaviour. 2. That he accept any supervision from the Probation and Parole Service which that Service deems necessary for whatever period that Services deems necessary.24. I had intended to mention in my remarks on sentence - and omitted to and was reminded by Mr Gillett - in reducing the sentence to three years and fixing the non parole period at fifty per cent, I have taken into account that Mr Zantout has already served six days in custody. Now is there anything else?WHITE: Your Honour I am instructed to apply for an order for compensation in relation to the amount stolen from the victim, but I don’t wish to be heard at length about that application. HIS HONOUR: What provision of what Act do I make that order?WHITE: It is the Victims Support and Rehabilitation Act your Honour I believe and unfortunately I have not brought the legislation with me. I am sorry I cannot assist your Honour further in relation to that.HIS HONOUR: I think without the legislation, I am not going to make the order.WHITE: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I don’t want to be cavalier about it, so far as the victim is concerned he has been lured to that place and had been relieved of eleven and a half thousand dollars, if you want to make an application then do it by notice of motion. I am here for another month. You would obviously need to bring Mr Zantout and his representatives along. Just without your assistance with the legislation and any criteria by reference to which I make an order, I don’t think I should. WHITE: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: anything else Mr White or Mr Gillett, before I explain the sentence to Mr Zantout?GILLETT: No thank you your Honour.WHITE: No thank you your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right. 25. Mr Zantout, I have sentenced you to three years gaol and I have said that you have to serve eighteen months, half of that. Normally you serve about seventy per cent so it would be about two years - over two years you would serve - but because of what Mr Gillett argued and Mr White acknowledged I am allowed to readjust it and I have done that. Your three years starts today. There is a minimum of eighteen months and that finishes on 29 April 2011. On that day I have ordered that you be released and you are on parole for the following eighteen months. You have to behave yourself and stay out of trouble and you have to report to Probation and Parole and if they think you need supervising then they will. If you don’t behave yourself then you are back before me and you might have to go back into gaol, do you understand that?OFFENDER: Yes.26. All right. It is not easy sending a young man like you to gaol, but the crime you got involved in was very serious for the reasons that I have explained and the impact on the victim, it must have been a dreadful experience for him to be where he was. I also expect that if I had given you anything less than full-time gaol that the prosecution may have appealed and that the Court of Criminal Appeal may have sent you to gaol in about three or four months time. I am not saying that is their fault. The Court of Criminal Appeal says what I need to do and I have decided that you should go to gaol but I am just pointing out that if I had not have sent you to gaol somebody else might have.HIS HONOUR: Now is there anything else?WHITE: No thank you your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I am going off the bench now and you may wish to talk to your sister and relatives, she might want a few minutes with you just before you are taken down.

   JUDGMENT1. I am sentencing Raymundo Antonio Orellana for a very serious crime. The crime is importing drugs into Australia. The crime is an offence under the Criminal Code Act 1995, s 307.2(1) of the Commonwealth. It involves what is called a marketable quantity of the drug. The drug was cocaine. The maximum penalty is twenty five years imprisonment. 2. Mr Orellana pleaded not guilty when he was charged with this offence but a jury found him guilty of the offence on 25 August this year and I now formally convict Mr Orellana of that offence. 3. Mr Orellana has been in custody since he was arrested on 17 November 2007. Having considered all the other available sentences, no other sentence is appropriate than full time custody and it will date from 17 November 2007. 4. First I must say something about what happened in this case. Mr Orellana flew to Venezuela and back to Australia. He was away for only a short period of time in late 2007. When he came back through Sydney Airport his suitcase was searched by customs officers who found some clothes in one of the suitcases which were impregnated by some kind of substance. The substance turned out on chemical analysis to be cocaine. Cocaine is what is called under the Australian law a border controlled drug. 5. The prosecution says that the amount of cocaine is close to two kilograms. Mr Brassil, who appears as Mr Orellana’s counsel, argues that I cannot determine the amount of cocaine any more than about 250 grams. This is one of the most important factors in my sentencing of Mr Orellana. The minimum amount of cocaine to be a marketable quantity is two grams. When the amount of cocaine imported becomes two kilograms it becomes what is called a commercial quantity. The sentence for importing a marketable quantity is twenty five years. The sentence for importing a commercial quantity is life imprisonment. 6. Because this question was so important there was evidence called about it in the sentence proceedings in addition to the evidence given in the trial. Mr Flood, who appeared as the Crown Prosecutor on the trial and in the sentence, called a scientist from the Australian Forensic Drug Laboratory – Mr Cameron - who was the operations manager of that laboratory. He was examined by Mr Flood and cross-examined by Mr Brassil. 7. Mr Brassil argued that the process of weighing the cocaine was something that the scientists were not familiar with and that there was an element in the weighing called measurement uncertainty. He argued that I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the amount of cocaine was nearly two kilograms. The opinion expressed by Mr Cameron was that the amount extracted by the scientists from the clothes was just over two kilograms, namely 2,080 grams. He was of the opinion that the process used extracted at least ninety percent of the cocaine. That figure takes into account what the scientists call measurement uncertainty. 8. I was impressed by Mr Cameron as a witness. I was also impressed by his qualifications and experience and the position which he holds at the laboratory. He was a frank witness who acknowledged at least once an area outside his expertise as being something he could not comment on. 9. The actual measurement was done by a scientist called Ms Yu. As for the challenge by Mr Brassil that they were not familiar with the process I accept Mr Cameron’s evidence that they have about two or three cases a year which involved what he called impregnation. Mr Cameron was involved in all of them. Mr Cameron was involved in this case at the beginning with a couple of items from this case but then Ms Yu took over but Mr Cameron remained involved as the supervisor and person who checked Ms Yu’s findings. In fact there is a formal process in the laboratory of double checking findings. Mr Cameron said they used a process which, in their opinion, extracted the majority of cocaine from the clothes in this case. When cross-examined by Mr Brassil he made it clear that that was also his own opinion. He gave evidence that he reviewed Ms Yu’s findings and found no errors and that she had followed all of the procedures. 10. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the amount of cocaine which Mr Orellana imported into Australia in his suitcase was near the upper end of the range for a marketable quantity. 11. I also heard evidence, which I accept, during the trial that the street value of the cocaine imported by Mr Orellana was over one million dollars and not far short of two million dollars. Mr Orellana of course did not admit that he imported this cocaine. He defended the case, as is his right. I do not have any evidence on which I can find where he might be in any hierarchy of drug importers. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he is a principal. He is at the very least a courier but what is more important the High Court made clear in the The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 is that classifying an offender must not “obscure the assessment of what the offender did”. That passage is at [19] and what Mr Orellana did in this case was to import not much less than two kilograms of cocaine into Australia. 12. I find that the importation of that cocaine was the purpose for his brief trip to Venezuela. He acquired the cocaine somewhere in South America, probably Venezuela but it may have been one of the other ports which he visited and of course he, according to the jury’s verdict, knowingly brought it into Australia. What is important to appreciate is that the amount of cocaine imported is not far short of 1,000 times the minimum amount for a marketable quantity of cocaine. That is a very serious example of this crime. 13. Mr Orellana has one conviction for a dishonesty offence. That offence was committed many years ago and is what the law calls spent. I do not place any weight on that conviction, it will not count against Mr Orellana. 14. He is a man with strong family connections both immediate and extended. He came to Australia himself as a refugee. He has children and loyal siblings and nieces and nephews. He has a good work history in Australia in unskilled employment. It seems that he is otherwise a man of good character but the higher courts say that good character is of limited value in drug matters: a person of good character is unlikely to attract the attention of the authorities and therefore more likely to be selected as a person to import narcotics.15. Mr Brassil points out that his client has no assets of any value and a strong connection with his family which I accept. He is not on the fringes of the community but very much part of a family and the workforce. I put a little weight on the fact that until the trial the charge faced by Mr Orellana was one of importing a commercial quantity of cocaine, carrying a life sentence. Indeed that charge went to the jury but it was made clear by the prosecution that the evidence could not sustain that charge. 16. It is Mr Orellana’s first time in gaol. His mother aged seventy-six lives in Sydney and requires assistance. Although Mr Orellana usually attended to that, it has been attended to by other family members since he went into gaol. The law is very strict on whether I am allowed to give leniency because of the impact of a sentence on family members. It says that I cannot give that leniency unless there are truly exceptional circumstances. This sentence will obviously have an undesirable impact so far as Mr Orellana’s mother’s care is concerned but it does not fall within the category of truly exceptional circumstances in my opinion. 17. There is a pre-sentence report prepared by an officer of the Probation and Parole Service which confirms that Mr Orellana left school in the middle of his secondary education when he was fifteen in the country where he was born - El Salvador - and that he is well regarded as a worker in the prison. He has no addictions such as drugs or gambling.18. I cannot take into account any remorse or contrition because Mr Orellana pleaded not guilty. Pleading not guilty does not count against Mr Orellana at all but it does mean that he cannot ask me to give leniency because of remorse. He showed some cooperation with the authorities in that he was prepared to be interviewed but of course he denied committing the offence. 19. It is important that any judge, including me, takes into account the need for people to be stopped from importing drugs into Australia by imposing appropriate sentences. I have reviewed the statistics - made available by counsel - from the Judicial Commission and some authorities referred to by Mr Flood.20. I consider that an appropriate sentence in this case, taking into account everything that I have referred, to is eleven years imprisonment and I regard an appropriate non-parole period as six and a half years imprisonment. Both the sentence and the non-parole period will date from 17 November 2007. Now in a moment I will explain that Mr Orellana, I’m just going to have a word to my associate. 21. The sentence will commence on 17 November 2007 and the eleven years expires on 16 November 2018. The non-parole period commences on 17 November 2007 and expires on 16 May 2014.Now the first question is whether I have the mathematics right: I am addressing this to counsel, if you both just check that.GRODZICKI: Yes that looks right to me.BRASSIL: Yes it appears to be correct your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Okay the second thing is whether I have made any factual errors Mr Brassil?BRASSIL: Your Honour I’m not prepared to cavil with any matters your Honour has raised.GRODZICKI: As far as I am aware, no.22. Now Mr Orellana I have sentenced you to eleven years gaol. The minimum that you have to serve is six and a half years. After six and a half years you become eligible for parole and that six and a half years expires on 16 May 2014 and your overall sentence finishes on 16 November 2018. Whilst you are on parole you must be of good behaviour or you may have to serve the full sentence.Now is there anything that I should explain because I am obliged to explain the sentence and I think, I don’t think I have to explain--GRODZICKI: I think that covers it your Honour.HIS HONOUR: That covers it?GRODZICKI: Yes.HIS HONOUR: Mr Brassil?BRASSIL: Yes your Honour I have nothing further.HIS HONOUR: All right thank you. And Mr Brassil just for the record thank you for the email which you sent to my associate indicating that there is no matter on which you made any submissions so far as the trial is concerned and about which you have not received a judgment from me, now that’s the case?BRASSIL: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Great thank you Mr Brassil.

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HALL J: Three persons, all juveniles at the date of the offence involving the death of Christopher Charles Leicester, were charged on indictment. Because they cannot be identified, each will be referred to by initials. These remarks on sentence concern the offenders DGP and PB, both of whom entered guilty pleas to the offence of manslaughter. Following the pronouncement of sentence in relation to each of those two offenders, I will adjourn for 15 minutes. I will then separately deal with the sentencing of the other offender, who shall be referred to as CW. 
     
      
    2 The offender, DGP is of Aboriginal descent and he and the offender, PB, were each charged on indictment that on 25 November 2007 at Woolooware in the State of New South Wales they did murder Christopher Leicester, or alternatively, that they did feloniously slay Christopher Leicester. 
     
      
    3 On 30 June 2009, the two offenders both pleaded guilty to the alternative count of manslaughter, which were accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictments. The offenders first offered to plead guilty to that offence on the final day of the committal hearing, namely, on 3 December 2008.4 On 18 September 2009 at the joint sentence hearing, the offenders both gave evidence. I will refer a little later to their evidence and to the other evidence tendered at the hearing, which included reports from the Department of Juvenile Justice and psychologist reports. In relation to the offender DGP, a Juvenile Justice Report dated 11 September 2009 was tendered and marked as Exhibit G and a report of Mr Peter G Champion, clinical psychologist, was tendered and marked as Exhibit 7. In respect of the offender PB, a Juvenile Justice Report dated 15 September 2009 was tendered and marked as Exhibit F and a report of Ms Michelle Player, clinical psychologist, was tendered and marked as Exhibit 1.  
     
      
       
      (2) Facts  
       
      
    5 The events concerning the subject offence took place at Woolooware Oval on the night of 24 November 2007. At the hearing on sentence, an agreed statement of facts was tendered and marked as Exhibit J. The document, it was agreed, sets out relevant factual material for the purpose of the sentencing hearing. Accordingly, in sentencing DGP and PB, I proceed upon the basis of the factual matters set out in Exhibit J. 
     
      
    6 The deceased, Christopher Leicester, had arrived in Australia from New Zealand in May 2007. On the night of 24 November 2007, he met Jackson Parkes at Woolooware Railway Station. Parkes invited him to a party nearby and they began to walk towards The Kingsway heading to Woolooware Oval.  
     
      
    7 At the same time, Taylor Martin, Jesse Harrison and PB began to walk from Woolooware Station up Swan Street towards The Kingsway. CW, who was driving a Holden sedan, turned into Swan Street from The Kingsway. The offender, DGP, was seated in the front passenger seat.  
     
      
    8 The subsequent events are set out in the agreed statement of facts as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        About this time the offender [PB] was seen to have an argument with another youth. This male has begun to take his shirt off and he yelled in the direction of [PB] and the car.  
        
       
       
        
        As the car drove off Jackson PARKES observed two males yelling at the car and chasing after it as it turned onto the Kingsway. 
        
       
       
        
        As the vehicle was driving past Woolooware Oval a male yelled something in the direction of the vehicle. [CW] pulled his vehicle over adjacent to the oval.  
        
       
       
        
        [DGP] and [PB] got out of the vehicle and ran into the oval followed by [CW]. They approached the deceased who was walking with PARKES towards the party. The deceased was not the male who had yelled out to the car although the three Offenders believed he was.  
        
       
       
        
        [PB] said to the deceased: “why did you yell shit at us”? and he PUSHED the deceased who pushed [PB] back. [DGP] then PUNCHED the deceased under the chin causing his head to reel back and he fell to the ground.  
        
       
       
        
        As the deceased lay on the ground [DGP] KICKED HIM ONCE TO THE HEAD. 
        
       
       
        
        Following this [CW] kicked the deceased to the head about three times. On the last kick a loud crack was heard. [CW] was heard to say to the deceased: “Yeah stay on the ground where you belong.” [CW] was then dragged away from the deceased by an unknown person. 
        
       
       
        
        [PB] was present encouraging the others and ready to assist if necessary. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst the deceased was being assaulted a number of people heard a loud crack sound.  
        
       
       
        
        The three Offenders left the area and retuned to [CW]’s vehicle and left 
        .” 
        
       
      
    9 Once the deceased fell to the ground, he did not regain consciousness. Ambulance and police were called to the scene. Mr Leicester was taken to St George Hospital. As a result of his injuries, he died at 2.21 pm on 25 November 2007. 
     
      
    10 Dr Paul Botterill, forensic pathologist, conducted the post-mortem on the deceased. Dr Botterill found that the cause of death was blunt force head injury consistent with multiple blunt force contacts. The injuries included bruising to the right temple, the right eye socket, the left cheekbone and the right side of the jaw, as well as over the limbs and trunk. The left cheekbone was also fractured. Dr Botterill also found a large amount of blood over the brain which was found to have been caused by a tear to the vertebral artery supplying blood to the brain. In his opinion, this was the direct cause of death.  
     
      
    11 The blood alcohol level of the deceased was 0.172, which would, in Dr Botterill’s opinion, have resulted in the deceased being less likely to defend himself and to be able to prevent his head moving when struck, causing the vertebral artery to rupture.  
     
      
    12 Dr Botterill was unable to say which blow was primarily causative of death, and could not discount that it was the first punch to the chin. Although he could not be precise, Dr Botterill opined that the force required for a fracture (such as to the cheekbone), would be moderate to severe. The loud crack sound could, in his opinion, have been the fracturing of the cheekbone. 
     
      
       
      (3) Submissions for DGP 
       
      
    13 Mr P J Pearsall of counsel for GDP, provided a Written Outline of Submissions on Sentence and made oral submissions. It was emphasised that none of the offender’s acted with an intention to kill. Reliance was placed upon the following mitigating factors under s.21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999:- 
     
      
       
      • There was no evidence that the attack was planned (s.21A(3)(b)). 
       
       
      • The offender, DGP, does not have any record of prior convictions (s.21A(3)(e)). 
       
       
      • He is a person of good character (s.21A(3)(f)). 
       
       
      • He is unlikely to re-offend (s.21A(3)(g). 
       
       
      • He has good prospects of rehabilitation (s.21A(3)(h)). 
       
       
      • He has shown remorse for the offence (s.21A(3)(i)). 
       
      
    14 Mr Pearsall referred to the intelligence assessments that have been made on the offender. He observed that, despite his capacity, he maintained satisfactory attendance at high school and had lived a law-abiding life. He had finished Year 10 about a month before the commission of the offence. 
     
      
    15 It was accepted that, by the time of the offence, he “had come into the habit of drinking every second or third week-end with friends”. On the night in question, he had consumed at least six 440 ml cans of Bourbon and Coke. This would have disinhibited him and impaired his judgment in the submissions made. Reliance was also placed on Mr Champion’s observations as to his level of maturity. 
     
      
    16 It was submitted that the offender’s intoxication is some mitigation in that it goes to explaining why the offender acted out of character and is relevant to the degree of deliberation involved in the commission of the offence: Regina v Coleman (1990) 47 A Crim R 306 at 327. 
     
      
    17 Mr Pearsall also relied upon the fact that there was no planning or premeditated violence. 
     
      
    18 In relation to s.19(4) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, it was submitted that there are circumstances that permit the making of an order that GDP serve his sentence as a juvenile offender. Those circumstances are:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) that the person is vulnerable on account of illness or disability (within the meaning of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977), 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that the only available educational, vocational training or therapeutic programs that are suitable to the person’s needs are those available in detention centres,  
        
       
       
        
        (c) that, if the person were committed to a correctional centre, there would be an unacceptable risk of the person suffering physical or psychological harm, whether due to the nature of the person’s offence, any assistance given by the person in the prosecution of other persons or otherwise.” 
          
        
       
      
    19 GDP gave evidence at the sentencing hearing on 18 September 2009. He gave evidence of a family break up when he was 13 years of age. He had been close to his father. He felt, after his father went to Dubbo, the loss of fatherly guidance. 
     
      
    20 He said, whilst he has been in custody, he has had counselling with a person from the Violent Offender’s Programme. On release, he intends to live in Orange with his uncle who is involved in construction work. He said that he has resolved not to drink alcohol following his release from custody. 
     
      
    21 At the centre of his submissions, Mr Pearsall emphasised what he described as the limited intellectual capacity of the offender and his immaturity and in the latter respect what was said to be the offender’s overreaction because of his immaturity. 
     
      
    22 It was submitted on behalf of DGP that the initial confrontation leading to the assault on the deceased was triggered by the mistaken belief that the deceased had verbally insulted DGP and his friends a short time before. I consider that to be an entirely irrelevant fact. It is certainly not one that operates as even the slightest mitigation. 
     
      
    23 It was the act of pushing by PB and the victim’s pushing back that was said to have caused him to become involved in the assault as he wished to come to the aid of his friend, PB. I find that account very difficult to accept, given that both offenders, DGP and PB, ran onto the oval obviously intent on causing trouble by confronting the person who they believed to have offended them. 
     
      
    24 The contention advanced by Mr Pearsall was that DGP’s involvement in the assault must be assessed in the context of his immaturity, low intelligence and tendency towards impulsive behaviour. He submitted that, consistent with the observation in the Juvenile Justice Report, the offender was an impulsive and immature person, and that he acted with impulsiveness and immaturity on the night of the offence. The submission was that impulsivity and the level of maturity of DGP are relevant to the question as to whether he committed an adult crime.  
     
      
      (4) Submissions for PB 
       
      
    25 Mr N Steel of counsel for PB in his oral submissions at the hearing on sentence submitted, firstly, that implicit in the plea to manslaughter, there was no intention on the part of PB to inflict grievous bodily harm. He emphasised the spontaneous, unplanned nature of the offence, and the fact that there was “a quick explosion of violence”.  
     
      
    26 The following mitigating factors under s.21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were relied upon:- 
     
      
       
      • It was an unplanned offence (s.21A(3)(b)). 
       
       
      • The offender, PB, does not have any record of prior convictions (s.21A(3)(e). 
      
     
     
      
      • He was unlikely to re-offend (s.21A(3)(g). 
       
       
      • He has good prospects of rehabilitation (s.21A(3)(h)). 
       
       
      • He has shown remorse for the offence (s.21A(3)(i)). 
      
    27 It was also submitted that PB’s culpability was less than that of his co-offenders as he was not involved in the physical assault. Although it was acknowledged that he had the initial confrontation with the deceased, it was submitted that he did not actively urge on or aid his co-offenders. To say he was the instigator, was, according to Mr Steel, putting his client’s culpability too high.  
     
      
    28 The explanation given as to the offenders’ conduct was a mistaken belief that the deceased had earlier verbally provoked them. It was submitted that this fact indicated that the attack was not purely random, although the submission that it was a spontaneous decision was also maintained. 
     
      
    29 In relation to PB’s subjective case, it was submitted that his interest in rugby league, part time work, courses engaged in whilst in custody and his history in relation to alcohol should be taken into account. In particular, PB’s level of social maturity was said to be a significant factor. Mr Steel also referred to the finding made by Ms Player that his recidivism risk is low.  
     
      
    30 The offender, PB, gave evidence at the sentencing hearing on 18 September 2009. He explained that he had been charged in relation to another offence, assault occasioning actual bodily harm in the company of others. He admitted to hitting the victim of that assault in the face because he thought he was going to hit him. He was heavily intoxicated at the time of that offence.  
     
      
    31 Although he has found his time in custody difficult, he has engaged with a psychologist (Ms Player) and other courses have been offered to him. In relation to remorse, he explained that the letter he wrote to the Court (Exhibit 6) explained how he felt about his involvement in the offence. He felt deeply sorry for the impact he had caused to Mr Leicester’s family and vowed never to be involved in a violent crime again. 
     
      
    32 In respect of an order under s.19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, it was submitted that special circumstances were established. Reliance was placed on s.4(b) and (c), and the evidence said to support the contention was to be found in Ms Player’s report. In her report, Ms Player noted PB’s emotional condition in custody and asserted that a transfer to an adult correctional centre would negatively impact on his already vulnerable mood, coping skills and mental health. She also alluded to his youthful appearance which would make him a target in an adult centre. 
     
      
    33 As to the sentence to be imposed, Mr Steel relied upon the cases of Regina v Clay, Lonsdale and JM [2006] NSWSC 1220 and Regina v Taiseni, Motuapuaka, Leota and Tuifua [2007] NSWSC 1090.  
     
      
    34 The decision of Buddin J in Clay (supra) was referred to in respect of his Honour’s finding that immaturity was a significant contributing factor to the offence, despite the seriousness of the offence. The relevant offender in that case of Clay was aged 19 at the time of the offence, and aside from punching the deceased once, had played a passive role in the commission of the offence. His Honour sentenced Clay to a non-parole period of three years and a balance of term of two years. 
     
      
    35 Mr Steel submitted that PB’s involvement in the assault was a result of his social immaturity, and that his confrontation with the deceased demonstrated that. Reliance was placed on a number of findings in Ms Player’s report. It was submitted on behalf of PB that in light of these findings, and the circumstances of the offence, PB’s actions were the product of immaturity and impulsivity. In particular, my attention was drawn to PB’s argument with a youth on the street preceding the offence, and the impulsive decision to stop the car, run onto the oval, and engage in a verbal and physical confrontation with a stranger.  
     
      
    36 In the case of Taiseni (supra), each of the four offenders were responsible for the infliction of grievous bodily harm caused by one offender when he threw a chair at the victim, whilst the remaining offenders were present and participating in the joint criminal enterprise. Although their presence in the hotel was designed to confront the victim with the force of numbers, two of the offenders did not engage directly in physical force, and accordingly, Latham J found that their culpability was well below that of their co-offenders.  
     
      
    37 These cases, it was submitted, demonstrated a comparable range of sentences in respect of PB.  
     
      
       
      (5) Subjective and mitigating factors 
       
      
    38 In the present case, it is relevant to have regard as I do to the following matters in relation to the subjective features of the two offenders:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The fact that DGP was 16 years and six months of age and PB was 16 years and one month of age at the date of the offence. 
       
       
      (2) DGP does not have a criminal history. PB has a limited history which I shall refer to shortly. 
       
      
    (3) Both offenders have demonstrated remorse. 
     
      
     (4) Both offenders have good prospects for rehabilitation.  
     
      
     (5) The offence did not involve a weapon. 
     
      
     (6) The offence did not involve premeditation or planning. 
     
      
    39 In regard to the issue of youth and maturity, Mr Champion observed that DGP was not an adult “with life experience, maturity and judgment”. However, no reference was made in Mr Champion’s report to any particular level of immaturity in DGP than that expected of a person of his age. Similarly, none of the character references provided on behalf of DGP allude to any particular aspect of immaturity. Even accepting the evidence recorded in the Juvenile Justice Report, evidence of immaturity and impulsiveness has to be considered in light of the nature of the offence. The assault, as has been noted earlier, in this case was completely unprovoked one. It involved, on DGP’s part, a severe blow to the head capable of causing death and with the victim lying on the ground, a kick of extreme force to the head/neck, also capable of causing death. These actions, in the context of a total lack of provocation, demonstrate the application of a very high level of violence and a willingness to injure.  
     
      
    40 With respect to PB, at paragraph [20] of Ms Player’s report, she records the opinion of PB that it was largely his immaturity at the time of the offence that contributed to him being present at the assault of the deceased. PB also admitted that he could be influenced by his peers at times, and that his mother frequently advised him to “think before you do” (paragraph [25]).  
     
      
    41 This suggested to Ms Player that his “levels of social maturity may have been delayed and that this probably led to him acting more impetuously in social contexts and possibly around certain peers. It would appear that these factors were contributory to [PB]’s involvement in the offence”. His emotional immaturity in social contexts, in Ms Player’s opinion, may have made him vulnerable to the negative influence of others and may have caused him to behave irrationally without contemplating the consequences of his actions. Whilst she acknowledged that social immaturity and impulsivity could be observed in most adolescents, Ms Player found that these factors had an impact upon PB’s offending behaviour. Regard is to be given to the offender’s age and I will bring it into account in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed with respect to PB. 
     
      
       
      (6) The personal circumstances of DGP 
       
      
    42 The offender, DGP, is, as I have stated, of Aboriginal descent. He was born on 18 May 1991 and was therefore aged 16 years and six months at the date of the offence. He is now aged 18. At the time of his arrest, he was residing with his mother and siblings in Menai, and had completed Year 10 (and the School Certificate) at a school in Caringbah.  
     
      
    43 His parents’ marriage ended when he was 12 years of age. Following the divorce, his father remained in the Sutherland area and continued contact. At the age of 15, his father commenced a new relationship and returned to the Dubbo area. Since that time, the offender has had limited contact with his father. Mr Champion, clinical psychologist, noted that while the separation of his parents would have impacted upon him, there was no suggestion of any significant psychological disturbance in this respect. 
     
      
    44 According to the Juvenile Justice Report, the offender was a “young man with a history of impulse control problems, who experiences learning difficulties and who has had limited peer interaction”. The offender’s mother has stated that a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) was considered by a medical practitioner in the offender’s early childhood, however, medication was not used to address this issue. Mr Champion noted in his report that there were some indications of such a condition present specifically in terms of issues with concentration and impulsivity. However, Mr Champion found no obvious indication of mental illness or psychological disturbance. Given his age and maturity, Mr Champion did not think that he would be particularly likely to be psychologically disordered in the future.  
     
      
    45 Written and verbal reports from the relevant school reveal that DGP had experienced difficulties with literacy and numeracy and that he required learning assistance throughout his high schooling. As recorded in his report, Mr Champion administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III). The offender achieved a score at the bottom of the average range in terms of overall IQ. His scores demonstrated poorly developed language and verbal skills but better developed non-verbal skills and reasoning. The results of testing did not indicate the presence of developmental disability or global intellectual limitation.  
     
      
    46 The offender has no criminal history. In respect of his behaviour at school, he was suspended twice during Year 8 for physical violence against another student and for continued disobedience. In Year 10, he was warned for aggressive verbal behaviour. The offender explained these incidents to Mr Champion as a function of a social group at school where aggressive behaviour periodically appeared. 47 He described to the authors of the Juvenile Justice Report a short history of alcohol use starting with the consumption of alcohol at the age of 16 years and a pattern of binge drinking two to three weekends a month. This behaviour was not linked to any alcohol dependency or mental illness, but rather to the phenomenon of underage binge drinking in Australia, and more particularly, in the Shire area of New South Wales. Mr Champion stated in his report that the offender’s alcohol use is an issue, as evident in the circumstances of the subject offence, which will need to be addressed. 
     
      
    48 Mr Rick O’Brien, an Aboriginal Mentor at the school previously attended by the offender, described him as a nice young man who was at times impulsive and hot headed. In his account to the authors of the Juvenile Justice report, Mr O’Brien explained that the offender had difficulty expressing his emotions and sometimes reacted with verbal and physical aggression. However, Mr O’Brien stated that, after losing his temper, the offender quickly calmed down and demonstrated remorse.  
     
      
    49 The offender has a long history of involvement in playing rugby league and has played for a number of clubs. The majority of his high school years were dominated by training and games, and his social activities were mostly connected to the sport. In Year 9, after struggling with his level of fitness, he withdrew from the high school rugby league. A decline in the offender’s discipline and attitude was noted after his withdrawal from the school football programme. 
     
      
    50 Whilst in custody, the offender has participated in available courses and attended the Girrakool School within Frank Baxter Juvenile Justice Centre. Such courses have included hospitality and Aboriginal art. His time spent in custody, almost two years, has been without incident.  
     
      
       
      (7) The personal circumstances of PB 
       
      
    51 The offender, PB, was born on 20 October 1991 and was therefore aged 16 and one month at the time of offence. He is now aged 18. At the time of offence, he had completed Year 10. It is said that he attended both primary and high school without incident, and exhibited no behavioural problems and received no suspensions or expulsions. However, PB did have difficulty concentrating while at school, and was diagnosed with ADD in kindergarten. However, he was never been prescribed medication in relation to this problem. There was no evidence of impaired intellectual functioning or disability in the Juvenile Justice Report. 
     
      
    52 Michelle Player administered the Adolescent Psychopathology Scale (APS) to PB. The APS is designed to assess symptoms of psychological disorders. PB’s responses revealed no clinical elevations in any scales for psychological disorders, personality disorders or psychosocial disorders. This indicated that PB was psychologically stable. He did not report instigating physical conflicts with peers or problems with anger control. He did acknowledge, however, that he and his friends did retaliate with verbal abuse if provoked. 
     
      
    53 In regard to his intellectual functioning, PB completed the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) as directed by Ms Player. His verbal performance was in the borderline to low-average range of cognitive ability (7th percentile), whereas, his non-verbal performance was in the average range (39th percentile). This discrepancy suggested to Ms Player the possibility of a mild learning disorder affecting language. 54 PB disclosed to the authors of the report that he began drinking with peers at approximately 15 years of age. He estimated that he would drink approximately once a fortnight but considered this as a social use. He reported drinking four cans of pre-mixed spirit drinks (approximately six standard drinks) in one drinking session. On the night of the offence, he reported that he had consumed one can of pre-mixed Bourbon and Coke. Although he did not report any incidences of vomiting or alcohol poisoning, according to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), this level of alcohol consumption constitutes binge alcohol use for which psychosocial harms could occur. 
     
      
    55 PB does have a criminal record as indicated by Exhibit C. He was sentenced to a 12 month good behaviour bond without supervision on 5 May 2009 after pleading guilty to the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in the company of others. He was 15 years of age at the time of that offence. 
     
      
    56 The Juvenile Justice Report records that his parents’ marriage broke down when he was approximately one year old. PB’s mother cited domestic violence, coupled with illicit drug and alcohol use, as being the factors that contributed to their separation. Although PB maintained contact with his biological father in his childhood, they grew estranged during his adolescence. When PB was two years old, his mother began a new relationship. Their recent separation upset PB, but he reported a positive and supportive relationship with both his mother and step-father. In Ms Player’s opinion, the marriage breakdown, and any violence and substance abuse, may have impacted on his early attachment style and emotional development. However, a supportive stable family context since the age of two has acted as a buffer to the potential psychological harm of the former abusive relationship. 
     
      
    57 The majority of PB’s friendships were formed at high school and through his involvement in football. He reported that he was involved in an intermittent relationship with a peer-aged female over the year prior to his arrest and for six months after imprisonment. PB was a keen footballer and was a member of a local rugby league club for the last 13 years. He has played rugby league for his former school and the district, as well as representing NSW in touch football.  
     
      
    58 Upon completion of his school certificate, PB intended to begin an apprenticeship in either air-conditioning and refrigeration mechanics or concreting. During High School, PB worked part-time at McDonalds and Pizza Hut, and was paid for refereeing touch football matches. Whilst in custody, PB has engaged in several courses, including an Alcohol and Other Drugs Program, a Changing Program and a General Education Program. Currently, he is enrolled in a course in Hospitality. According to the staff at Girrakool School, he is a mature, independent worker who enjoys and participates in his schooling. 
     
      
       
      (8) Risk of re-offending and prospects of rehabilitation 
       
      
    59 On the subject of recidivism, Mr Champion identified a number of risk factors relevant to DGP by using an instrument which he described (Assessing Risk for Violence). Those risk factors identified as being present in DGP include his youth at the time of first violent incident and substance abuse problems. Mr Champion also specified a further risk factor for which the evidence was equivocal, considering DGP has no criminal antecedents, in particular, no history of violent offences. Mr Champion noted there was a potential history of “early maladjustment” given the offence for which he was charged and his suspensions. There were, however no other indicators for such a condition. 
     
      
    60 On the whole, in Mr Champion’s opinion, the risk of further major violence is limited. This opinion was based upon DGP not abusing alcohol or associating with peers or subcultures that engage in violent behaviour.  
     
      
    61 Both Mr Champion and the authors of the Juvenile Justice Report recognise that given the appropriate education and counselling, DGP has good prospects for rehabilitation. Whilst in custody, both recommend he receive remedial education, vocational training and substance abuse counselling. DGP has already participated in counselling as part of the Violent Offenders’ Programme.  
     
      
    62 According to the authors of the Juvenile Justice Report, PB presented with a number of “positive protective factors”. These included a supportive family environment, positive recreational and sporting interests and clear goals for the future. He did not identify with any attitudes endorsing violent behaviour or specify any exposure to violence during his childhood. Whilst in custody, as stated earlier, he has participated in educational courses and counselling. Given his positive response and commitment to counselling, in the opinion of the Juvenile Justice Report authors, continued intervention would be to his benefit. His level of remorse and commitment to ongoing treatment and support indicated that the likelihood of recidivism was low.  
     
      
    63 Similarly, Ms Player stated in her report that overall PB reveals good levels of psychosocial functioning. He did not present with drug, alcohol or gambling problems, endorse anti-social attitudes, demonstrate mental health difficulties or impulse control or anger management problems. She did note that his alcohol consumption patterns should be monitored to ensure binge drinking does not occur. Consistently with the Juvenile Justice Report, Ms Player identified a number of protective factors which reduce the risk of recidivism. In summary, she assessed his recidivism risk as low. 
     
      
      (9) Evidence of remorse and contrition by DGP and PB 
       
      
    64 The agreed statement of facts records that shortly after the incident, DGP admitted what he had done and expressed remorse to a number of people. When asked by Ms Moran what had happened, DGP began to cry and said, “I was only sticking up for a mate. I only punched him once and kicked him”.  When questioned by police, DGP made admissions as to his involvement in the assault, including his particular actions.  
     
      
    65 Mr Champion noted that DGP has expressed considerable regret for having committed the offence, on the basis of the loss of life and impact on the deceased’s family. This is consistent with the views expressed in the Juvenile Justice Report. 
     
      
    66 DGP gave evidence at the hearing on sentence in which he stated that he felt “deeply sorry for what I’ve done” and accepted responsibility for the loss he has caused to the deceased and his family. 
     
      
    67 PB expressed genuine guilt and contrition for his involvement in the offence to the authors of the Juvenile Justice Report and to Michelle Player, psychologist, and in an open letter to the Court (Exhibit 6). At no time did he minimise his responsibility for his actions. He said to Ms Player, “no one deserves to get their life taken away from them, I think about it every day”. Although he had written a letter to the deceased’s family apologising for his role in the attack, he advised Ms Player that he hoped that one day he could express his remorse to them in person. His evidence at the hearing on sentence demonstrated remorse and he said “I realise I’ve played a role that took Chris’ life and it’s going to eat away at me the whole rest of my life and so it should. I’m really sorry”.68 I accept that the offenders’ expressions of remorse were genuine and, as such, I will take this into account in their favour in determining sentence. It is relevant to an assessment of their prospects of rehabilitation and the likelihood of the commission of further offences in the future: Regina v MAK and MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381 at [41]. 
     
      
       
      (10) Manslaughter sentencing principles 
       
      
    69 The matters of law and legal principles to which I will now refer, apart from reference to those that are concerned with the entry of guilty pleas, apply equally to all three offenders. They will, save for the exception to which I have referred, be incorporated into the remarks on sentence in relation to the offender CW. It will therefore not be necessary for me to repeat those principles, which I am now about to deal with, when I come to the sentencing of CW. 
     
      
    70 The maximum penalty for manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment: s.24 of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    71 Determining a proper sentence for manslaughter is notoriously difficult given the variety of circumstances in which the offence can be committed: Regina v Green [1999] NSWCCA 97 at [24]. Some assistance can be gained from a consideration of the facts and sentencing outcomes of other cases. However, these do not determine an inflexible range. They can only provide general points of reference. Similarly, little assistance is to be gained from sentencing statistics which encompass all forms of manslaughter: Regina v Mohamad Ali [2005] NSWSC 334 at [61]. 72 Spigelman CJ said in Regina v Forbes (2005) 160 A Crim R 1 at [133]–[134]:-  
     
      
       
        
        “… manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence … In its objective gravity it may vary, as has been pointed out, from a joke gone wrong to facts just short of murder.  
         
         
        It is also relevant to recognise that, although manslaughters can be characterised in different ways, particularly in the various contexts which may reduce what would otherwise be a murder to manslaughter, the degree of variation within any such category is generally also over a wide range. Matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter 
        .” 
        
       
      
    73 It is, as the Chief Justice has observed, important to bear in mind the denunciatory role of sentencing for the offence of manslaughter: Regina v MacDonald (unreported, NSWCCA, 12 December 1995). The offence involves the felonious taking of human life, and whatever form it takes, it has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime. The protection of human life is a primary objective of the system of criminal justice, which is reflected in the community’s expectations of that system. 
     
      
      (11) Manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act 
       
      
    74 It is common ground that the pleas of guilty of the two offenders to manslaughter were entered on the basis of the commission of an unlawful and dangerous act, being the severe assaults upon Mr Leicester.  
     
      
    75 Manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, involving an appreciable risk of injury, is a category of involuntary manslaughter. Involuntary manslaughter, unlike murder, does not require proof of intent to cause death or grievous bodily harm to the victim, nor the other mental elements necessary for murder: The Queen v Lavender (2005) 222 CLR 67 at 70.  
     
      
    76 The physical element is the unlawful and dangerous act which causes death. The mental element concerns that act, in that the act must be willed and not an accidental one: Wilson v The Queen (1991-92) 174 CLR 313 at 328. The only relevant intent is that required to do the act, and that the act inadvertently caused death: Lavender (supra) at 82-83. To be found guilty of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, the circumstances must be such that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have realised that he or she was exposing another or others to an appreciable risk of serious injury: Wilson (supra) at 332-4; Regina v KT [2007] NSWSC 83 (Johnson J).  
     
      
    77 It has been said that there is no hierarchy of seriousness between voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. Spigelman CJ said as much in Regina v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 183 at [29]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Even a case where there is present an intention to kill or maim, which would constitute murder but which is reduced, by reason of provocation or diminished responsibility, to a charge of manslaughter, will not necessarily attract a higher sentence than other forms of manslaughter, including the relevant one here, ie, killing by an unlawful and dangerous act. As a five judge bench of this Court, including Gleeson CJ, Mason P, Hunt CJ at CL, Simpson and Hidden JJ, said in  
        R v Issacs 
         (1997) 90 A Crim R 587 at 595:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The argument for the appellant advanced on this appeal appeared to assume that a case of provocation manslaughter is necessarily, or at least ordinarily, worse that  
          [sic]  
          a case of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. We do not accept that. Each case depends upon its own circumstances. The range of sentencing available in the case of manslaughter is notoriously wide. There have been cases where provocation manslaughter has resulted in non-custodial sentence.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    78 It is, accordingly, necessary to consider these principles in determining the appropriate sentences to be imposed in the present case. The pleas of guilty by the offenders DGP and PB constitute admissions to all the essential elements of the crime of manslaughter: Maxwell v The Queen (1995-96) 184 CLR 501 at 510. I am to give appropriate consideration to their age at the date of the offence. Section 3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act defines child as any person under 18 years and accordingly the offenders stand to be sentenced in accordance with the provisions of that Act.  The offence of manslaughter is a serious children’s indictable offence and, accordingly, the offenders are required to be dealt with according to law (s.3, s.16 and s.17, Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act).79 I will later consider and make findings with respect to the objective seriousness of the offence in this case, taking as a starting point, the elements of the crime as admitted by the offenders by way of their pleas of guilty. 
     
      
       
      (12) The sentencing discretion 
      
    80 In determining the sentences in the present case, I am required to consider both the objective and subjective factors relevant to the offence and the aggravating and the mitigating factors in accordance with the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and relevant sentencing principles. I am required by law to take account of a number of matters in determining the objective gravity of the offence committed by each offender and the other matters to which I have referred. The sentence to be imposed is one that is appropriate to the particular crime, having regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively: Regina v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. 
     
      
       
      (13) Victim impact statements 
      
    81 The death of Mr Leicester was a tragedy for him and his family. The victim impact statements, each of which was read in Court, poignantly conveyed the impact that Mr Leicester’s death has had upon his mother, father and sister. Those statements are to be received upon the basis of accepted principles. A sentencing judge’s approach to victim impact statements (from the family of a deceased victim) can only be accepted within the confines laid down by Regina v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 96); Regina v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510 at 529-530; Regina v Tzanis [2005] NSWCCA 274 at [15]-[18] and Whybrow v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 270 at [17]. 
     
      
    82 One of the purposes of reading victim impact statements publicly at the sentencing hearing is to reinforce to the offenders, and to others who might act in a similar way, the devastating consequences of their actions. In this case, the conduct of the offenders pursuant to their joint criminal enterprise involved senseless violence of a high order committed upon a stranger in a public place. The effects of that conduct extend beyond the death of Mr Leicester. The profound consequences for the family of Mr Leicester should be made clear to the offenders and to the community at large.  
     
      
    83 Victim impact statements are received and considered for the purposes of s.28 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Section 28(3) provides that a Court must receive a victim impact statement given by a family member and acknowledge its receipt, and may make any comment on it that the Court considers appropriate. 
     
      
    84 It was observed by the Court of Criminal Appeal (Johnson J in Regina v SBF [2009] NSWCCA 231 at [88]) “… There is no requirement for victim impact statements to be referred to in some shorthand way …”. 
     
      
    85 In the present case, the impact statements made by Mr Leicester’s mother, father and sister each recorded clearly and poignantly the devastating consequences that the death of their son and brother has had upon each of them as a result of the offence committed by the offenders. One of the purposes for which a Court may impose a sentence on an offender I note is “to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community”: s.3A(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    86 I am, as I have earlier stated, conscious of the limitations upon the use of the victim impact statements, in particular, those limitations flowing from the Privitera principle governing the use of such material. 
     
      
    87 However, it is not inappropriate to observe that the impact of crimes of homicide in cases such as the present, as revealed by the victim impact statements, remind both judges who are dealing with such cases on a not infrequent basis and the community of the appalling and devastating loss and distress that results from violent crimes, in particular, those senseless crimes of random violence involving innocent citizens. (14) Sentencing offenders involved in a joint criminal enterprise 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    88 A joint criminal enterprise exists when two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime: McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108 at 114. The understanding or arrangement need not be express and may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached at any time before the crime is committed. The circumstances may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then and there to commit that crime: Regina v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 at 556. 
     
      
    89 If one or other of the parties to the understanding or arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime, they are all equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission. 
     
      
    90 A person participates in a joint criminal enterprise either by committing the agreed crime itself or simply by being present at the time when the crime is committed, and (with knowledge that the crime is to be or is being committed) by intentionally assisting or encouraging another participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit that crime: Tangye (supra) at 557. The presence of that person at the time when the crime is committed and a readiness to give aid if required is sufficient to amount to an encouragement to the other participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime.  
     
      
    91 Despite each party to a joint criminal enterprise being equally liable, it will often not be appropriate to give each party the same sentence. As Gibbs CJ explained in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal, and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender, and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence, have to be taken into account 
        .” 
        
       
      
    92 To such end, the role each offender plays in an offence of manslaughter is crucial to assessing their respective culpability: Lowe (supra) at 609; Regina v Howard (1992) 29 NSWLR 242; Carruthers v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 276. The examination of the facts extends to the level of participation in the physical acts that caused death: Regina v Mamae [2001] NSWSC 936; Howard (supra); Regina v Tan [2007] NSWSC 684; Carruthers (supra).  
     
      
    93 Where an offender pleads guilty, any facts beyond the ingredients of the offence must be either proved by evidence or established formally in an agreed statement of facts: Gas v The Queen (2004) 217 CLR 198 at [30]. As I have stated earlier, I am bound by the facts set out in the agreed statement of facts in respect of each offender’s participation in the offence.  
     
      
    (15) Sentencing juvenile offenders 
     
      
    94 Section 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act provides legislative guidelines in the exercise of criminal jurisdiction with respect to children:-  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        A court, in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children, shall have regard to the following principles:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them, 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance, 
        
       
       
        
        (c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption, 
        
       
       
        
        (d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home, 
        
       
       
        
        (e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind.” 
        
       
      
    95 Accordingly, I must have regard to these principles in sentencing the offenders. 
     
      
    96 In KT v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 51, McClellan CJ at CL set out the relevant principles in sentencing young offenders. In that case, his Honour referred to the principles enunciated in s.6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. His Honour stated at [22]:-  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        22. The principles relevant to the sentencing of children have been discussed on many occasions. Both considerations of general deterrence and principles of retribution are, in most cases, of less significance than they would be when sentencing an adult for the same offence. In recognition of the capacity for young people to reform and mould their character to conform to society’s norms, considerable emphasis is placed on the need to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        23. The law recognises the potential for the cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity of a young person to contribute to their breach of the law. Accordingly, allowance will be made for an offender’s youth and not just their biological age … The weight to be given to the fact of the offender’s youth does not vary depending upon the seriousness of the offence … Where the immaturity of the offender is a significant factor in the commission of the offence, the criminality involved will be less than if the same offence was committed by an adult … 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        25. … The emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders, may be moderated when  
        the young person has conducted him or herself in the way an adult might conduct him or herself and has committed a crime of violence or considerable gravity  
        … In determining whether a young offender has engaged in ‘adult behaviour’ … the court will look to various matters including the use of weapons, planning or pre-meditation, the existence of an extensive criminal history and the nature and circumstances of the offence … Where some or all of these factors are present the need for rehabilitation of the offender may be diminished by the need to protect society. 
        
       
       
        
        26. The weight to be given to considerations relevant to a person’s youth diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity ... A ‘child-offender’ of almost eighteen years of age cannot expect to be treated substantially differently from an offender who is just over eighteen years of age ... However, the younger the offender, the greater the weight to be afforded to the element of youth…” 
         (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    97 In KT (supra), it was submitted that the offender was behaving childishly and immaturely in throwing eggs at people, and had reacted impulsively to the victim hitting the car with an object by striking one blow to the victim. Johnson J in that case considered the age of the offender, who was 16 at the time of the offence, and the fact that the initial conduct of throwing eggs had an element of immaturity about it. However, his Honour found that the offender’s conduct in returning to the victim for the purpose of engaging in a violent confrontation was not juvenile behaviour. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of four years and a parole period of two years. The appeal against sentence was dismissed by a majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
     
      
    98 The youth of an offender does not automatically justify the amelioration of a sentence that would otherwise be imposed in accordance with the common law principles underlying s.6: SBF (supra) at [143]. It is only where the circumstances of a particular young offender, and the circumstances of a particular offence, indicate that general deterrence and retribution ought play a lesser role that the principles are given their full expression: IE v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 70; 183 A Crim R 150 at 155 [16].  
     
      
       
      (16) Objective circumstances of the offence  
       
      
    99 The following matters are material to the question of the objective seriousness of the offence of manslaughter in this case:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The offenders, followed by CW, exited the vehicle and ran onto the oval. It is clear from this evidence that they were intent on causing a confrontation. Together, they approached the deceased, who was walking with Parkes towards the party.  
       
       
      (2) The offenders caused a confrontation with Mr Leicester which was wholly unprovoked and wholly unjustified. At least by the time the confrontation commenced, DGP intended to assault the victim.  
       
       
      (3) The offender, PB, was the instigator of the verbal attack upon Mr Leicester when he said, “ 
      why did you yell shit at us? 
      ” and proceeded to push him.  
       
       
      (4) The offender, DGP, then instigating an immediate escalation of the verbal and physical confrontation commenced by PB to which I have referred.  
       
       
      (5) DGP punched the victim with a closed fist. The evidence indicates that the punch was a ferocious one to the head and sufficient to knock Mr Leicester to the ground.  
       
       
      (6) The offender, DGP, immediately followed the forceful punch to the victim’s head with a severe kick to Mr Leicester’s head whilst he was lying on the ground and unable to defend himself.  
       
       
      (7) The punch and the kick made by DGP involved a level of force capable of causing fatal injury 
       
       
      (8) CW then intervened and I will deal separately with his intervention in the remarks on sentencing concerning CW. 
       
       
      (9) In combination, the multiple assaults, to which I have referred, constituted a vicious and cowardly attack on an entirely innocent young man. 
       
       
      (10) PB, at all material times, was present with his co-offenders and ready to assist if necessary, a fact implicit in his guilty plea. The need for any further physical assistance from him, however, did not eventuate as DGP and CW’s actions rendered it unnecessary for PB to further assault the victim. 
      
    100 Although the findings of Dr Botterill establish that the cause of death was blunt force head injury, they do not indicate with precision which blow was the primary cause of death. Consistent with Dr Botterill’s findings, one of the blows delivered by DGP could have caused the death of Mr Leicester. It is also possible that a kick delivered by CW to the head could have been the primary cause of death. In short, both DGP and CW must be sentenced upon the basis that one or other of them inflicted the fatal wound but it is not possible to say which one of them did so. They both, however, are to be sentenced upon the basis that they meted out a high level of violence pursuant to the joint criminal enterprise. 
     
      
    101 Crimes of violence committed by young offenders have been the subject of particular attention by the Court of Criminal Appeal and by single judges of this Court in recent times. 
     
      
    102 Whether or not there has been an acceleration in the incidents of unprovoked violent crimes by young male offenders (and there is some evidence to suggest that it has), young offenders who do engage in crimes of violence that culminate in the death of an innocent victim, may expect sentencing courts to impose substantial sentences that adequately reflect the need for general deterrence in the community. 
     
      
    103 In KT (supra), McClellan CJ at CL at [25] observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders, may be moderated when the young person has conducted him or herself in the way an adult might conduct him or herself and has committed a crime of violence or considerable gravity ... In determining whether a young offender has engaged in ‘adult behaviour’ …, the court will look to various matters including the use of weapons, planning or pre-meditation, the existence of an extensive criminal history and the nature and circumstances of the offence … Where some or all of these factors are present the need for rehabilitation of the offender may be diminished by the need to protect society.” 
        
       
      
    104 In KT (supra), the sentencing judge (Johnson J) (the appeal against sentence was dismissed by majority) observed (at 118):- 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, the factors of punishment and deterrence are significant factors on sentence on this case. General deterrence is an important factor in this case. Young persons must be made aware that vulnerability of human beings require restraint by others and a rejection of unprovoked violent assaults … This was an objectively serious offence committed by a young man living in an adult world. Although the provisions of s.6 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and sentencing principles with respect to young offenders remain relevant, it is appropriate in this case to reflect on the sentence the elements of punishment and deterrence which must not be subsidiary to the rehabilitation of the offender.” 
        
       
      
    105 The present case is another instance of an innocent citizen being set upon in a public place, in entirely unprovoked circumstances, and subjected to serious assault involving explosive violence by young males acting together in a joint criminal enterprise. 
     
      
    106 In cases such as this, there is a need in sentencing for there to be a proper accounting for all relevant factors and a sentence that reflects them. General deterrence is one such factor. General deterrence, it has long been recognised in sentencing law, sends a message out to the community that those engaging in conduct of the kind involved in the present case, being criminal conduct that produces fatal consequences, can expect such offending to be addressed by substantial terms of imprisonment. 
     
      
    107 In KT (supra), McClellan CJ at CL observed (at [41]):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… there is considerable force in the view that, notwithstanding the youth of the offenders, the decisions of the courts for this type of offence have provided a range of penalty which fails to adequately reflect the need for general deterrence and retribution. The recent experience of this Court indicates that the range of penalties imposed on young offenders who commit random acts of violence resulting in death may not have been sufficient to deter others from similar irresponsible criminal behaviour. In my opinion although the circumstances of an individual offence and offender must always be considered, this Court should in future accept that more significant penalties may be required when sentencing offenders for this type of offence.” 
        
       
      
    (17) Alcohol 
     
      
    108 It is important to recognise the role which alcohol played in the commission of this offence, in particular, in relation to DGP. DGP indicated to Mr Champion that he began drinking on the evening at about 7.00 pm on the night of the offence, and over a period of four hours, consumed approximately 12 to 16 standard drinks. This would suggest that DGP was significantly intoxicated at the time of the offence.  
     
      
    109 Mr Champion explained in his report the effects which intoxication can have on judgment and control, particularly in young men in their reaction and tendency to aggression. In DGP’s case, his level of intoxication could have lessened his inhibitions, impaired his judgment and made him more likely to act aggressively when faced with a confrontation situation. How are the effects of alcohol to be evaluated in sentencing in the present case? 
     
      
    110 Clearly, heavy consumption of alcohol affected DGP, it being remembered that he was 16 years old at the time. Intoxication by alcohol will not be considered as a mitigating factor where it was not out of character for the offender to become intoxicated: Regina v Fletcher-Jones (1994) 75 A Crim R 381. In this case, it was not out of character for the offender, DGP, to become intoxicated and he knew what effect alcohol could have on him. Furthermore, he chose to drink excessively. In those circumstances, as was the case in Fletcher-Jones (supra), if anything, the voluntary ingestion of alcohol was an aggravating factor rather than a mitigating factor. 
     
      
    111 In my view, punishment and deterrence are significant factors on sentence in this case. General deterrence has been held to have particular relevance in cases involving unprovoked violence and aggression. As I have previously stated, young people, males in particular, frequently commit offences of this type. 
     
      
    112 In my opinion, this is a case where the need for general deterrence is imperative. It was said in Regina v Mitchell (2007) 177 A Crim R 94 at [29] that:-  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Violence on the streets especially by young men in company and under the influence of alcohol or drugs is all too common and needs to be addressed by sentences that carry a very significant degree of general deterrence 
        ”. 
        
       
      
    113 It is an unfortunate and a disturbing fact that this Court often encounters cases in which there is a clear association between the excessive consumption of alcohol and very serious crimes of violence. The ready availability of alcohol in our community, even by persons who are under the age of 16, as in this case of the offender DGP, may, at least partly, explain that association. In this case, in his very detailed report, Mr Champion, a very experienced clinical psychologist who specialises in forensic assessments, wrote:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Unfortunately the abuse of alcohol amongst teenagers in large groups is a fairly common phenomenon in various parts of Sydney, and certainly in the ‘Shire’ area … there is in my experience (from cases in which I have been involved) something of a problematic drinking culture, where violence and aggression is a not uncommon outcome. Having said this  
        [DGP]  
        indicated that it had not been his habit to drink and to ‘look for trouble’ as it were.” 
        
       
      
    114 In such cases, general deterrence may be a significant matter in sentencing and, where appropriate, is to be regarded as a relevant and an important factor in determining the sentence to be imposed. I do not consider that the elements of punishment and deterrence are subsidiary to the rehabilitation of the offenders in this case.  
     
      
       
      (18) Plea of guilty 
       
      
    115 As I have earlier observed that the offenders first offered to plead guilty to the charge of manslaughter on the final day of the committal hearing on 3 December 2008. The plea was not then accepted by the Crown. Following committal, the offenders again offered to plead guilty to that offence. The Crown, however, did accept the offenders’ pleas to manslaughter at trial on 30 June 2009.  
     
      
    116 The Crown does not contest the proposition that the offenders should each receive a discount on sentence at the higher end of the available range for the pleas of guilty in accordance with the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. However, at the end of the day, the appropriate discount is one that I am required to determine on the relevant facts.  
     
      
    117 In the present case, the offer of a plea first occurred over 12 months after the date of the offence and was offered, not before, but on the last day of the committal hearing. There is, in my opinion, no proper basis for a contention that the offer of a plea to guilty was made at the earliest possible opportunity. The offer came only after the two offenders in question had the full benefit of hearing the evidence in the Crown case at committal. It was only then that DGP and PB acted to make the offer to enter a plea. 
     
      
    118 In all of the circumstances, I consider that a discount below the maximum, namely, of 20% is an appropriate discount to be applied, having regard to the circumstances to which I have referred and I will act accordingly in deriving the sentences to be imposed. 
     
      
       
      (19) Finding of special circumstances  
       
      
    119 Before stating the sentence to be imposed, it is necessary to record my conclusion that this is a case in which a finding of special circumstances should be made in terms of s.44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I make such a finding in relation to both DGP and PB having regard to their youth, reasonably good prospects of rehabilitation together with the fact that the sentence to be imposed will, in each case, be each offender’s first prison sentence and there is a need for supervision and counselling upon release. These circumstances separately and together justify, in my opinion, a variation of the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the parole period in respect of each offender and I so find. 
     
      
       
      (20) Conclusions on relative culpability of PB 
       
      
    120 The evidence indicates that DGP’s culpability in relation to the offence is towards the high end of the range for such offences. I find that PB’s culpability is less than that of his co-offender’s, DGP and CW. However, his participation in the assaults was, of course, sufficient to establish him as party to the joint criminal enterprise. PB’s presence at the time of the assault, and his readiness to give aid to his co-offenders if required, must be taken into account in determining his culpability. 
     
      
    121 I do not, with respect to the submissions made, consider that the conduct of the kind in question, involving such a high degree of criminality, can be merely characterised as the conduct of immature youths. Both DGP and PB acted with deliberation, purpose and cruelty.  
     
      
    122 In relation to DGP, his actions involved a punch and a kick that was so powerful that either one of them was capable of causing death. In my opinion, the matters to which I have referred in these remarks place DGP’s conduct well above that of mere immature conduct.  
     
      
       
      (21) The appropriate sentence 
       
      
    123 I have had regard to the objective seriousness of the offence, to which I have referred earlier. I have also taken into account the offenders’ pleas of guilty, by reason of those pleas of guilty they are entitled to the discount I have earlier referred to of 20%, the subjective factors concerning both of them including the evidence of their remorse and contrition, youth, good prospects of rehabilitation and the matters contained in both the Juvenile Justice Reports and psychologists’ reports.  
     
      
    124 By reference to the objective circumstances of the case, DGP’s culpability is, as I have said, at a very high level. Whilst there are some subjective factors, in particular, his development without an adequate sense of self-control and the disadvantage of a certain level of intellectual functioning or capacity and his age, there is little else by way of significant mitigating factors, apart from his plea of guilty and expressions of remorse, both of which, as I have stated, I do propose to take into account. 
     
      
    125 The culpability of the offender PB, I assess to be considerably less than that of his two co-offenders. His plea of guilty and expressions of remorse are also factors to be considered in mitigation. In terms of his subjective case, I have taken into account that he has a lower than average capacity of intellectual functioning but that he has made progress whilst in custody and has strong prospects of rehabilitation, having regard to what has been identified as positive protective factors. 
     
      
    126 Where the act of violence causes death, this Court is required to denounce such conduct by imposing appropriate sentences. Significant sentences of imprisonment are necessary in this case to punish and deter other offenders, and to send a clear message to those in the community to which I have referred. 
     
      
    127 I will now deal firstly with the sentence in respect of the offender DGP. Would that offender please stand. 
     
      
       
      (22) 
        
      Sentence in respect of DGP 
      
    128 The offender DGP is sentenced to a non-parole period of five years to commence on 25 November 2007 and to expire on 24 November 2012 and to a parole period of three years to expire on 24 November 2015.129 Accordingly, the first date upon which the offender DGP will be eligible for parole will be 24 November 2012. 
     
      
       
      (23) Sentence in respect of PB 
      
    130 The offender PB is sentenced to a non-parole period of three years to commence on 25 November 2007 and to expire on 24 November 2010 and to a parole period of two years to expire on 24 November 2012.131 Accordingly, the first date upon which the offender PB will be eligible for parole will be 24 November 2010. 
     
      
    132 Both offenders have attained the age of 18 years. Unless an order is made under s.19(3) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, the offenders will not be eligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as juvenile offenders.  
     
      
    133 Having regard to the opinions contained in the Juvenile Justice Report and the report of Mr Champion, I accept that due to his limited intellectual capacity, DGP would be vulnerable in an adult prison (see DAC v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 265 at [23]). In respect of PB, I have considered the views contained in the Juvenile Justice Report and the report of Ms Player. I note that adult imprisonment may have a detrimental effect upon PB’s mental wellbeing. Additionally, as Whealy J found in Regina v VDN [2004] NSWSC 426, I am satisfied that both offenders’ rehabilitation will be substantially enhanced by their continued detention in a juvenile detention centre. The particular need to maintain relationships with staff and others involved in his rehabilitation determine that special circumstances may be found in this case: Regina v MB [2006] NSWSC 1164 at [36].  
     
      
    134 The Crown does not contest the making of such an order, and accordingly, I make a finding of special circumstances and order that the whole of the terms of sentence of imprisonment be served by DGP and PB as juvenile offenders pursuant to s.19(3) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Suzanne Lenton appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at an early stage to an offence of ongoing supply of drugs. She asks that when I sentence her for that matter I take into account two matters on a Form 1. They related to possession of some drugs and also her possession of items which may have reasonably thought to have been stolen. The substantive matter covers seven separate acts of supply committed on 29 April, two on 5 May, 8 May, 14 May, and two on 22 May, the day she was arrested. In total she supplied somewhere around 4 grams of methylamphetamine to an undercover police officer. 2 He was introduced to her and began purchasing drugs from her in the following circumstances. He would attend at her premises, tell her how much he wanted and then together they would drive to another location where Ms Lenton would obtain the drugs and hand them over to him. On occasion she obtained the drugs from a Mr Eleman a man who I earlier sentenced and a Mr Hall who I also sentenced on an earlier occasion.3 Ms Lenton performed the role of the intermediary between the supplier and the purchaser. She did not keep any of the drugs that she would supply to the undercover officer in her possession, but would take him to the location where the drugs were, and obtain them from the dealer, facilitating the supply of the drugs and payment for those drugs. 4 She gave evidence that she began to get involved in these criminal activities in order to help Mr Eleman who was going to go to gaol for an offence and who had a disabled son. She wanted to assist him to make some money, because he would not be making any money while he was in custody, so that his family did not suffer as much as they might otherwise. Although it was not Ms Lenton’s desire to make money out of these transactions, she did want Mr Eleman to make some money and she also obtained some drugs herself for free by her involvement in these matters. It was not only of course Mr Eleman whom she approached to supply drugs though. As I have indicated she obtained drugs from others too when Mr Eleman was unable to supply to her.5 Ms Lenton is now forty years of age. She started using drugs when she was twenty-three. Her drug use escalated significantly after she suffered a miscarriage and the breakdown of a relationship at age twenty-seven and a significant illness, which she contracted a short time later. Drugs then became a problem for her. She says that she was then addicted to them, although she probably was addicted already, it is just that her level of drug use increased.6 Ms Lenton was raised in a supportive family. She has recently been unemployed. No doubt as a result of her increasing drug use she has found it difficult to obtain a job. She also says that the health problems which she suffered and the miscarriage and the breakdown of her relationship greatly increased her depression, which again would have impacted on her ability to seek and obtain a job. 7 She reports that since going into custody and performing worthwhile work there, firstly, in the library and then in another administrative capacity of some importance, she has regained her confidence and is now once more aware of what she can achieve for herself.8 A significant aggravating feature of her offence is that she was on conditional liberty at the time she was supplying drugs to the undercover officer. What makes it worse is that she was on conditional liberty for a drug matter. She was on two forms of conditional liberty to be precise, bail and a bond. She was actually reporting daily to police at the same time that she was supplying drugs to the undercover police officer. It is hard to imagine things could get worse as far as this aspect is concerned, but there is another factor to be taken into account as well. She was actually doing the Merit program, a lenient outcome imposed by the magistrate designed to facilitate her rehabilitation. She managed to fool a number of people who thought that she was rehabilitating herself, when in fact all she was doing was taking the opportunity of conditional liberty to commit this serious number of individual acts of supply.9 Somewhat unusually, even though Ms Lenton had been in custody since 22 May 2008 the day of her arrest, I recently released her from custody on a s 11 bond. The major purpose of that was to allow Ms Lenton to demonstrate, if she could, that her prospects of rehabilitation were good. I have since received an updated pre-sentence report and a report from the Binyani program which attests to Ms Lenton’s participation in rehabilitation and the good work that she had done in that regard. She has also become involved in Narcotics Anonymous and sees that as a positive way of moving forward. I am prepared to find that she has good prospects of rehabilitation. I should add that one of the conditions of the s 11 remand was that she undergo regular urinalysis. There is no evidence that she has used any drugs, and positive evidence to suggest that she has not, over the period of remand.10 Ms Lenton also reports that since being treated for her depression she has a much more positive outlook on life. She used drugs she says to self medicate to allow herself to get out of bed some days. Since being treated for her depression she no longer feels the need to do so and this is another matter suggesting a likely good outcome for Ms Lenton. 11 There is of course still some way to go and so it would be in Ms Lenton’s benefit, and thus the community’s, for her to be assisted by a longer period of eligibility for parole at the expense of the non-parole period. I thus make a finding of special circumstances. 12 I will also reduce the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by twenty-five per cent to reflect the circumstance of Ms Lenton’s plea and the fact that it was entered at an early opportunity. 13 The fact remains, however, that she committed a serious criminal offence, one which the authorities say requires that there be a substantial component of general deterrence. True it is that even if you add up all her supplies, there was no a huge amount supplied. But s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act is targeted at precisely the sort of conduct which Ms Lenton was engaged in, regular small acts of supply. 14 In her favour I accept from some of the material put before me in the form of transcripts of listening devices, that she was trying to get herself out of being the intermediary between the dealer and the undercover officer, hoping that they could deal directly with each other. That is a matter significantly in her favour.15 Ms Lenton was not doing this out of any feelings of greed. She was, as is almost invariably the case, a user dealer supporting her own drug habit and as she saw it, assisting Mr Eleman. I have sentenced Mr Eleman, Mr Hall and a Mr Ford as well. Mr Ford was not strictly a co-offender but was at least related, Mr Eleman and Mr Hall were co-offenders. Of course that raises the question of parity and the sentence I impose has to be such that Ms Lenton does not have a justifiable sense of grievance when she compares her sentence with that imposed on the others. It must be remembered that she was on conditional liberty at the time and I have outlined the gravity of the extent of that aggravating feature, which does not apply to either of the other co-offenders, and that she supplied on more occasions. Indeed one of them, I think it was Mr Eleman, was dealt with only for supplying a prohibited drug, not supplying on an ongoing basis. All of those factors of course have to be borne in mind when a comparison is made between Ms Lenton’s sentence and those imposed on Mr Eleman and Mr Hall.16 I have no doubt that Ms Lenton desires to put her drug use behind her. She impressed in the witness box as a person who was genuine in what she said. In some ways I gather she actually appreciates the intervention of the authorities in arresting her and then sending her to gaol as giving her the opportunity to put what she hopefully will consider in the future as a dark period of her life behind her.17 There was one matter I should address before I impose sentence. I have decided to date the sentence I will impose upon Ms Lenton from the day of her arrest. I recognise that for some part of that time she was on the s 11 remand and thus not in custody. She was, however, in quasi custody and as a measure of some leniency towards her I will treat that as if it was full-time custody and thus impose sentence to date from the day of her arrest.18 Ms Lenton is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years and a head sentence of four years to date from 22 May 2008. This means that Ms Lenton is eligible to be released to parole on 21 May 2010.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 Her Honour: The Defendants have all pleaded guilty to the offence of clearing native vegetation contrary to s 12(1) of the Native Vegetation Act 2003 (the NV Act). The offences occurred from 27 September 2006 to 24 May 2007 on Lot 136 in Deposited Plan 803593 and Lot 5 in Deposited Plan 1000390 at Tocumwal (the property). The directors of Calman Australia Pty Ltd (Calman) and Iroch Pty Ltd (Iroch), registered proprietors of Lot 136, contracted with the director of GD & JA Williams Pty Ltd trading as Jerilderie Earthmoving to undertake the clearing that gave rise to the offences. The native vegetation which was cleared was River Red Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis). The clearing was to take place on Lot 136. A small area of the neighbouring Lot 5 was also cleared inadvertently, there being no fence to delineate Lot 136 from Lot 5. That land is also owned by the directors of Iroch and Calman. The Defendants have to be sentenced. 
     
      
      Statutory scheme  
      
    2 Section 3 of the NV Act sets out the objects of the Act: 
     
      
       
        
        The objects of this Act are:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) to provide for, encourage and promote the management of native vegetation on a regional basis in the social, economic and environmental interests of the State, and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) to prevent broadscale clearing unless it improves or maintains environmental outcomes, and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (c) to protect native vegetation of high conservation value having regard to its contribution to such matters as water quality, biodiversity, or the prevention of salinity or land degradation, and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (d) to improve the condition of existing native vegetation, particularly where it has high conservation value, and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (e) to encourage the revegetation of land, and the rehabilitation of land, with appropriate native vegetation, 
         
        in accordance with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. 
        
       
      
    3 Section 12 of the NV Act provides the offence of clearing: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Native vegetation must not be cleared except in accordance with:  
         
          
          (a) a development consent granted in accordance with this Act, or 
           
          (b) a property vegetation plan. 
          
         
         
        (2) A person who carries out or authorises the carrying out of clearing in contravention of this section is guilty of an offence and is liable to the maximum penalty provided for under section 126 of the EPA Act for a contravention of that Act. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (3) It is a defence in any proceedings for an offence against this section if it is established that the clearing was permitted under Division 2 or 3 or was excluded from this Act by Division 4. 
        
       
      
    4 Section 126 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979, (the EP&A Act) referred to in s 12(2) of the NV Act in relation to the maximum penalty, provides: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) A person guilty of an offence against this Act shall, for every such offence, be liable to the penalty expressly imposed and if no penalty is so imposed to a penalty not exceeding 10,000 penalty units and to a further daily penalty not exceeding 1,000 penalty units. 
         
        … 
         
        (3) Where a person is guilty of an offence involving the destruction of or damage to a tree or vegetation, the court dealing with the offence may, in addition to or in substitution for any pecuniary penalty imposed or liable to be imposed, direct that person:  
         
          
          (a) to plant new trees and vegetation and maintain those trees and vegetation to a mature growth, and 
           
          (b) to provide security for the performance of any obligation imposed under paragraph (a). 
          
         
        
       
      
    5 One penalty unit is $110 pursuant to s 17 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the CSP Act). The maximum penalty for each Defendant is $1.1 million with a maximum daily penalty of $110,000. The Prosecutor considers that a daily penalty ought not be imposed. 
     
      
    6 The NV Act, introduced into Parliament in 2003, came into force on 1 December 2005. Prior to this Act a similar offence and penalty provision was provided by s 17 and s 21 of the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1997 (the NVC Act) (in force from 1 January 1998, now repealed). The maximum penalty for an offence against that section was also provided in s 126 of the EP&A Act, being $1.1 million.7 As the Defendants have pleaded guilty to this strict liability offence it can be assumed that all the elements of the offence are admitted. 
     
      
    8 In relation to the two Defendant landholders, Calman and Iroch, the essential elements of the offence which are assumed to be admitted are:(a) clearing occurred on the landholders’ property between 27 September 2006 and 24 May 2007;(b) the clearing was of “native vegetation” as defined in the NV Act;(c) there was no development consent granted under the NV Act for the clearing;(d) there was no property vegetation plan authorising the clearing; and(e) the landholders authorised and/or carried out the clearing.  
     
      
    9 In relation to the Defendant contractor, Jerilderie Earthmoving, the essential elements of the offence which are assumed to be admitted are: 
     
      
      (a) clearing occurred on two lots of land between 27 September 2006 and 24 May 2007; 
       
      (b) the clearing was of “ 
      native vegetation 
      ” as defined in the NV Act; 
       
      (c) there was no development consent granted under the NV Act for the clearing; 
      
      
      (d) there was no property vegetation plan authorising the clearing; and 
       
      (e) the contractor authorised and/or carried out the clearing 
      
    10 The Defendant landholders, Calman and Iroch, by the Defendant contractor, Jerilderie Earthmoving, cleared native vegetation by means of machinery including a chain saw, bulldozer and a loader with a stick rake. No issue of lack of authorisation was raised about the clearing on Lot 5 by the Defendant contractor although this is not owned by the two corporate defendants. 
     
      
    11 The parties usefully provided a Statement of Agreed Facts (the SOAF). The essential elements of this are as follows: 
     
      
       
       … 
       
       
      
    10. The Defendant, Jerilderie Earthmoving, and its employee, Gordon Stacpoole, cleared native vegetation on Lot 136 and Lot 5 in Deposited Plan 1000390, Parish of Tocumwal, County of Denison, local government area of Berrigan (Lot 5). 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    11. At all relevant times Gary Williams was a director of Jerilderie Earthmoving. 
     
      
       
        
        … 
         
        
       
      
    16. Lot 136 and Lot 5 are used as a single parcel of land with other land those two lots have a total area of 191.79 hectares. Each of the lots is zoned 1A General Rural pursuant to Berrigan Local Environmental Plan 1992. Agriculture is permissible without development consent in the zone. The other lots in the parcel are Lot 138 and Lot 4. The total area of the parcel which is used as one unit is about 450 hectares 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    17. The Murray River is the southern boundary of Lot 136 and Lot 5. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    18. The Property is immediately adjacent to a 200 acre vineyard to the north of Lot 136 and Lot 5. The vineyard is owned and operated by Calman and Iroch. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    19. At all relevant times Lot 136 was jointly owned by Calman and Iroch:· Calman has two directors: Michael Calman and Mary Calman. · Damian Ireland was the sole director of Iroch. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    20. At all relevant times Lot 5 was jointly owned by two individuals:· Mary Calman (also a director of Calman); and · Damian Ireland (the sole director of Iroch). 
     
      
       
        
       … 
       
      
    25. Calman and Iroch purchased the Lots 136 and Lot 5 in 1999 and clearing commenced sometime in September 2004. [Note: The parties agree this statement is strictly incorrect as Lot 5 is not owned by Calman and Iroch but nothing turns on this.] A bulldozer (Komatsu D85) … and a loader (CAT960) with a stick rake were used to up root the trees which were then cut into logs and stockpiled in eight woodpiles. … 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    26. Development consent was obtained to build a residence on Lot 5 where the Landholders and their families stay when visiting the vineyard. The general conditions to Development Determination No. 17/05/DA/DN for Lot 5 are contained in Annexure ‘B2’. [not attached] 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    27. The clearing was done to diversify the use of the Property to include dry land grazing.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    28. The landholders felt a responsibility to remove the vegetation “to enable larger red gum trees to thrive and to maximise the aesethic beauty of the property.” The clearing was done “to enhance and protect the property from risks such as bushfires and to assist in the financial sustainability of the property.”  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    29. “Gary Williams agists cattle on another section of the property well to the east of Lot 136 and the vineyard. In return Gary has agreed to maintain the roads on and around the vineyard which requires periodic grading and maintenance of the dam which he constructed for” the Landholders in 2000. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    30. … 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    31. The stumps of the trees were then burnt. Some areas were levelled after clearing operations and in most areas the original leaf litter, branch debris and native ground cover were removed and burnt.  
     
      
       
        
       THE AGREEMENT TO CLEAR 
        
       
      
    32. Sometime in 2004 an informal agreement was made between the landholders, Calman and Iroch and the Contractor to clear native vegetation on Lot 136. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    33. Clearing on Lot 136 was commenced by the Contractor, Jerilderie Earthmoving, in September 2004. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    34. The Landholders wanted vegetation removed on a gradual basis over a period of time. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    35. Although Jerilderie Earthmoving did not receive payment for the clearing on Lot 136 and Lot 5 it was to receive an ongoing benefit by agisting cattle on the Lots once cleared. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    36. The Landholder left it to the Contractor’s discretion to determine which areas of vegetation were to be cleared. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    37. Under the agreement the landholders, Calman and Iroch, would receive road grading and the removal of vegetation to allow better access generally. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    38. The Contractor was permitted to agist cattle on Lot 136 and to make improvements to the land to enable grazing and the sowing of pasture. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    39. Gary Williams was running cattle on another property owned by Calman and Iroch and wanted additional land to run cattle on.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    40. The Defendants planned to burn the cleared trees.  
     
      
       
        
       THE CLEARING OF VEGETATION 
        
       
      
    41. The native vegetation cleared was River Red Gum Eucalyptus Camaldulensis. This species is “native vegetation” within the meaning of the NV Act. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    42. Most of the 21 hectares cleared occurred on Lot 136. A small amount of clearing also occurred in the south-west corner of Lot 5. The clearing on Lot 5 is estimated at half a hectare.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    43. Native vegetation not stacked in woodpiles was burnt by Gary Williams. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    44. Jerilderie Earthmoving also employed Gordon Stacpoole to clear native vegetation using a dozer (Komatsu D85) and a loader (CAT 960) with a stick rake to push over the trees from 27 September 2006 until 24 May 2007. The contractor instructed Mr Stacpoole to “flatten it all” as it was to be cleared for cattle feed. The clearing was in a line, averaging about 3 chains wide – a chain is a term of measurement and it equates to 22 feet. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    45. Native vegetation was cleared so that the land could be used for grazing cattle. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    46. Native vegetation was cleared across four separate areas. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    47. Unsuitable Red Gums were stacked and burnt. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    48. No threatened plant species were recorded in the cleared areas. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    49. The clearing the subject of these proceedings commenced on 27 September 2006 as detailed in the following five (5) invoices issued by Jerilderie Earthmoving to Gordon Stacpoole: 
     
      
       
      
    · 8 October 2006 (38hours from 27 Sept. 2006 to 7 Oct 2006);· 26 October 2006 (17hours over 3 days);· 24 March 2007 (15.5 hours from 3 March 2007 to 14 March 2007);· 29 April 2007 (32.5hours); and· 18 May 2007 (73hours). 
     
      
       
        
       SITE INSPECTION 
        
       
      
    50. On 9 August 2007 DECCW officers, Sewell and Whitehouse conducted a field investigation at the Property and recorded the content of woodpiles 1 and 2. … 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    51. Eight (8) woodpiles of felled trees were observed on the Property. All woodpiles were surveyed and felled trees counted and collated in Table 1 below.

       Remote Sensing Interpretation  
        
       
      
    52. Annexure ‘E’ [not attached] contains aerial photographs and spot images between 1969 and 2008 of Lot 136 and Lot 5. Mr Stuart Lucas, a Natural Resources Project Officer (Resource Mapping) with DECCW in the Remote Sensing Section at Albury is an expert in the interpretation of land cover in aerial photographs and satellite images and has examined and interpreted the data in Annexure ‘E’. Mr Lucas found the following: 
     
      
       
      
    · Areas 4b, 3, 2 and 1 were cleared of almost all trees/scrubs prior to 16 February 1969. Area 4a had the understorey removed and maybe some thinning of larger trees. The vegetation structure is woodland, with part being open woodland.· In the 21 December 1976 aerial photograph a thick cover of woody vegetation occurs on Areas 4a, 4b, 2 and 1. The structural form is open woodland. · The thick cover of woody vegetation observed in the 1976 aerial photograph have now developed into small to medium sized trees in the April/June 1991 orthophoto and 20 February 1991 aerial photograph and there is no evidence of any deliberate clearing or thinning activities to vegetation within the defined areas. The vegetation structure is woodland, with part the area being open woodland.· The 14 February 1996 aerial photograph and orthophoto show re established vegetation cover observed on 1976 and 1991 aerial photographs is intact and trees have grown larger. There is no evidence of any management activity to change or disturb vegetation within the defined areas. The structural form of the native vegetation is open woodland/forest.· The 4 May 2003 aerial photograph illustrates re established vegetation cover observed on the 1976 aerial photographs, and later images, is intact and trees have grown larger. No evidence of any management activity to change or disturb vegetation within the defined areas. The vegetation structure is woodland to open woodland/forest.· No changes are observed between 2003 aerial photographs and the 26 December 2004 Spot image. The 2004 spot imagery shows re established vegetation cover observed on the 1976 aerial photographs, and later images is intact. There is no evidence of any management activity to change or disturb vegetation within the defined areas· The 2008 spot imagery identifies tree clearing by mechanical disturbance between 2004 and 2008 within each of areas 1 to 4.  
     
      
       
      
    53. None of the Defendants made any inquiries as to whether the vegetation to be cleared was regrowth as defined in the NV Act. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    54. The Defendants failed to make any inquiries as to whether approval would be required for the clearing. They made no inquiries as to what requirements were necessary prior to clearing vegetation on the Property. In particular, they did not contact either the Council or the Catchment Management Authority. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    55. On 24 May 2007 clearing ceased on Lot 136 and Lot 5 at the request of Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water (“DECCW”) (formerly the Department of Environment and Climate Change (“DECC”) ). 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    56. Some areas were mechanically levelled after the clearing operations and in most areas the original leaf litter, branch debris and native groundcover was removed or burnt; 
     
      
       
        
       Iroch Record of Interview  
        
       
      
    57. On 10 June 2008, during a voluntary interview under caution, the Defendant, Iroch, through its director, Mr Damian Ireland, made the following admissions: 
     
      
       
      
    (i) The clearing on Lot 136 and Lot 5 was authorised by Iroch and Calman over the previous three or four years;(ii) Trees larger than suckers were cleared on the Property;(iii) He thought he could clear 30 acres a year and that the clearing undertaken was within those limits. (iv) He thought you were allowed to remove anything up to 20cm in diameter;(v) He attended the Property about three times a year;(vi) He allowed the Contractor to clear the areas that had the most potential for what the Contractor needed and in return the landholders got cleared access tracks and road maintenance on the Property;(vii) He just wanted to thin the vegetation to run cattle. 
     
      
       
        
       Calman Record of Interview 
        
       
      
    58. On 10 June 2008, during a voluntary interview under caution, the Defendant, Calman, through its director, Mr Michael Calman, made the following admissions: 
     
      
       
      
    (i) He was at the Property on 20 October 2006, 22/23 January 2007, 9 to 12 March 2007 and 13 April 2007;(ii) The Landholders gave the Contractor permission to clear Lot 136;(iii) He was present on ‘one weekend’ when Gary was clearing with the bulldozer. He can’t remember when it was exactly. ‘I saw him knocking over these suckers and pushing them to one side.’ This was in ‘Area 4’;(iv) He was happy with the work that had been done by the Contractor and thought the property looked a lot better cleared. (v) He did not want to remediate as it would defeat the purpose of the clearing;(vi) He was present when some of the clearing was being done. (vii) The landholders did not really have any plans for the timber. They were going to just burn it or use it for firewood. The instructions to the Contractor were to get rid of it as quickly as possible. 
     
      
       
      
    59. The Landholders viewed the work progressively as it was carried out by the Contractor. 
     
      
       
        
       Jerilderie Earthmoving Record of Interview 
        
       
      
    60. On 14 March 2008, during a voluntary interview under caution,, the Defendant, Jerilderie Earthmoving, through its director, Gary Williams, made the following admissions: 
     
      
       
      
    (i) He supervised all the clearing on Lot 136 and Lot 5;(ii) Calman, Iroch and the Contractor decided to clear land for grazing cattle; (iii) He did not receive payment for the clearing; it was to receive an ongoing benefit of agisting cattle on Lot 136 once cleared.(iv) He employed, supervised and instructed Gordon Stacpoole to carry out the clearing.(v) He owns the machinery used to carry out the clearing.(vi) The eight woodpiles of felled trees still remain on the Property. (vii) He made no inquiries regarding the law relating to the clearing of native vegetation. He thought that private land could be cleared except within 50m of the Murray River and that no approvals for clearing were needed.(viii) He did not contact the Council, CMA, DECC, Fire Brigade or anyone to inquire if approval was needed to clear native vegetation. 
     
      
       
      
    61. On 2 June 2008, during a voluntary interview under caution,, the Defendant, Jerilderie Earthmoving, through its director, Gary Williams, made the following admissions: 
     
      
       
      
    (i) He had recently cleared vegetation in parts of Areas 1 to 4.[A51 and 52].(ii) The areas he cleared were “all good soil, good clearing.” so he could plant crops for grazing.(iii) He used the chainsaw to tidy up the felled trees and then stacked them and Mr Stacpoole used the dozer.(iv) He and the Landholders intended to use the felled trees for firewood as “it was too good to burn” and “its getting hard to find too, because you are not allowed to touch wood anywhere.”  
     
      
       
        
       REMEDIATION ORDER 
        
       
      
    62. Calman and Iroch have agreed to complete remediation work on Lot 136. Remediation work has not been required on Lot 5.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    63. The agreed Remedial Work includes: 
     
      
       
      
    · the setting aside of 47 hectares to be preserved and enhanced as native vegetation;· the area to be fenced with an electric fence;· the area is adjacent to the Murray River and well forested with River Red Gum, · the area is not to be farmed in any way including that there be no grazing;· reporting and monitoring requirements (for ten years). 
     
      
       
      
    64. Remedial work has begun and is to be completed by 30 September 2009.  
     
      
       
      Environmental harm 
      
    12 The parties also reached agreement in the SOAF concerning the level of environmental harm caused by the offences. A total of 21 hectares of native vegetation as defined in the NV Act was cleared on Lot 136 and Lot 5. The understorey associated with red gum is largely herbaceous; shrubs are usually scarce. Among the most important families are the grasses, daisies and sedges (Murray-Darling Basin Commission 2006). Much of the original leaf litter, debris and groundcover plants were removed during the clearing. The groundcover plants probably included native grasses, sedges, rushes and forbs similar to the suite of groundcover species which occur in the remaining stands on the property. No threatened plant species were recorded on Lot 136 or Lot 5. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
      
      Joint experts conference 
      
    13 On Thursday, 17 September 2009 the experts conferred and agreed to the following:(i) That native vegetation was cleared from the property within the meaning of the NV Act;(ii) That clearing was of River Red Gum open forest.(iii) That at least eight woodpiles exist on the property and the logs in the woodpiles are older than 15 years.(iv) Currently live trees exist on the property which are over 100 years old;(v) The cleared area provided potential habitat for the Superb Parrot and the Grey-crowned Babbler;(vi) The cleared vegetation created potential for erosion;(vii) That there was no evidence of smaller trees in the woodpiles as they were probably mulched and/or burnt. In most areas the original leaf litter, branch debris and native groundcover was apparently removed or burnt;(viii) No endangered ecological communities (EEC) were cleared on the property. 
     
      
       
      
     Prosecutor’s evidence14 The Prosecutor relied on the SOAF. 
     
      
    Defendants’ evidence15 Michael Calman swore an affidavit on 21 September 2009 which was read in part. Mr Calman is, along with his wife, a director of Calman. Calman has co-owned the property with Iroch since it was purchased in 1999. In 2001 to 2002 Mr Calman considered the area, which was subsequently cleared, to be unproductive thick growth which was difficult or impossible to drive through. There were signs of past clearing including stumps and felled wood. Cattle were difficult to manage in the absence of cleared tracks through the area. In 2004 Mr Calman retained Mr Williams to clear thick growth on the property. Mr Calman was aware that cattle had grazed in the area in the past and he believed the clearing would allow for past agricultural activity to resume. It did not occur to Mr Calman that any permission or consent was required. No clearing occurred and none was requested to occur within 50m of the Murray River. An existing track in that area was made passable again by grading. Mr Calman states that Calman has not previously been convicted of any offence. He is sorry that the offence was committed and it was not committed deliberately. He understands that the Department of Environment and Climate Change (DECC) is required to decide whether native vegetation should be cleared. Mr Calman says that it is his intention to remediate the cleared land. He states that he would have sought to obtain the required permission if he had been aware that it was required. He would also have offered to keep areas protected from clearing as the company has always intended to maintain a substantial part of the property as native vegetation. 
     
      
    16 Damian Ireland, sole director of Iroch, swore an affidavit on 19 September 2009. Mr Ireland states that he, with Mr Calman, engaged Gary Williams to carry out clearing work in 2004. He did not believe that the clearing required permission or consent because he believed a certain amount of clearing each year was permissible on a rural property. He states that the aim of the clearing was to improve that land by cultivating and sowing pasture for cropping and/or grazing, to remove dead and dying regrowth suckers to minimise fire hazards and to gain access to the property boundaries for fencing and fire protection. Mr Ireland states that he has since come to understand the importance of the protection of native vegetation and obtaining consents for clearing. He believes that the harm done has been well and truly compensated for by the setting aside of 47 hectares of land for remediation. He states that had consent been sought for the clearing he and Mr Calman would have offered to set aside areas of the property they owned to be maintained as native vegetation. They did not have the intention to remove all native vegetation on the property. Mr Ireland is sorry that the company breached the law and assures the Court that proper enquiries will be made in the future where consent is required. Iroch has not previously been convicted of any offence. Mr Ireland is a part time member of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal and a consultant hand surgeon who runs goodwill teaching excursions to the Pacific Rim and South East Asia.  
     
      
    17 Gary Williams, sole director of Jerilderie Earthmoving, swore an affidavit in September 2009 which was read in part. Mr Williams began Jerliderie Earthmoving twenty years ago. Its business is earthmoving and land clearing. Mr Williams manages the business and has done earthmoving and land clearing for more than twenty years. He has never before been prosecuted for a clearing offence. He states that at the time of the offence he was unaware of the NV Act including the offence provisions and that he was unlikely to have found out about the changes to the legality of land clearing without it having been specifically brought to his attention. Mr Williams attests to having carried out various works for Mr Calman in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. In 2004 Mr Williams had a conversation with Mr Calman and Mr Ireland about clearing some areas on the property. An agreement was reached whereby Mr Williams would clear the area without charge in return for being able to graze some of his cattle on the property. Mr Williams estimated that proper commercial rates for the clearing undertaken in 2006 and 2007 was approximately $55,000 to $60,000. He did not discuss with Mr Calman or Mr Ireland whether permission was required and he believed that no permission was required. He believed he was not permitted to clear within 50m of the Murray River and he did not clear any trees next to the river. He intended to sow native grasses on the cleared areas. Mr Williams states that he always intended to cooperate with the DECC investigation and that he answered questions in his interview with a DECC officer honestly. Mr Williams expresses regret on behalf of his company and is sorry for carrying out the clearing without the necessary permission. He realises now that he was foolish not to make enquiries as to whether permission was required. He states that in the future he will seek permission for clearing where required. Mr Williams attests to his company having made annual donations to local community organisations. 
     
      
    18 Character references for each of the directors of the Defendants who gave evidence, namely Mr Williams, Mr Calman and Mr Ireland, were tendered. Each character reference acknowledged that the clearing offence had been committed by the Defendants and attested to the excellent character of each of the directors.  
     
      
      
      Purposes of sentencing  
      
    19 Section 3A of the CSP Act identifies the purposes of sentencing as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        3A Purposes of sentencing 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows:  
         
          
          (a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
           
          (b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
           
          (c) to protect the community from the offender, 
           
          (d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
           
          (e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
           
          (f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
           
          (g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community. 
          
         
        
       
      
    20 In Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Rae [2009] NSWLEC 137 Preston J identified a number of purposes of sentencing in the context of the same type of offence at [9]–[12] in light of the objects of the NV Act. These included the need for general deterrence for offences of clearing native vegetation, particularly as this is highly likely to be carried out for commercial gain. His Honour considered commercial gain for agricultural purposes at [12], referring to Minister for the Environment and Heritage v Greentree (No. 3) (2004) 136 LGERA 89 (Greentree (No 3)). 
     
      
      Objective circumstances of the offence 
      
    21 An appropriate sentence is to be determined after consideration of the objective and subjective circumstances of an offence given that: 
     
      
       
        
        …a basic principle of sentencing law is that a sentence…imposed by a court should never exceed that which can be justified as appropriate or proportionate to the gravity of the crime considered in the light of its objective circumstances (see Veen v. The Queen (No. 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465, at pp 472, 485-486, 490-491, 496).

       (1989) 167 CLR 348 at 354 (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ). 
      
    22 Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd (2006) 145 LGERA 234 concerned an offence under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 and the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974. The matters relevant to sentencing discussed by Preston J at [134]-[158] apply to environmental offences such as these matters. In Bentley Preston J held at [163] that: 
     
      
       
        
        Amongst the objective circumstances that the Court may consider are: 
         
        (a) the maximum penalty for the offence; 
         
        (b) the objective seriousness of the offence having regard to its peace  
        [sic – place] 
         in the statutory scheme; 
         
        (c) the harm caused to the environment, and particularly the components of the environment harmed in the short and long term by the commission of the offence; 
         
        (d) the state of mind of the offender in committing the offence; 
         
        (e) the foreseeability of the risk of harm; 
         
        (f) the practical measures to avoid foreseeable risk of harm; and 
         
        (g) the reasons for commission of the offence. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
           
         
        
       
      
      
      Prosecutor’s submissions  
      
    23 The Prosecutor submits that factors (a), (b), (e), (f) and (g) listed in s 3A of the CSP Act are most relevant to each of the Defendants.24 The Prosecutor states that it is important to have regard to the objects of the NV Act, set out in s 3 of that Act, to give context to the offending conduct. A principal means by which these objects are achieved is by the prohibition on clearing of native vegetation unless consent is applied for and obtained, which process requires an environmental impact assessment to be undertaken. Clearing without consent undermines the environmental impact assessment process and the purposes of ecologically sustainable development including intergenerational equity and biological diversity, see Bentley at [65]-[71], [168] and [169], Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Hudson (2009) 165 LGERA 256 at [76] and Rae at [18]-[19].25 As there is no statutorily prescribed criteria for assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, those criteria identified in Bentley at [163] are appropriate. The high maximum penalty of $1.1 million for the offence reflects the seriousness with which Parliament views the offence of clearing of native vegetation contrary to s 12(1) of the NV Act, see Rae at [13], Bentley at [145].26 There was considerable environmental harm. Approximately 21 hectares of land were cleared and most of the trees cleared were mature, see SOAF at par 52 and 65-71. The report of Mr Lucas, natural resources project officer with DECC, states that the vegetation generally dated from re-establishment in the early 1970s, see SOAF par 52.27 The harm of clearing 21 hectares of native vegetation was foreseeable and could have been avoided by the compliance with the legislative scheme. Had the Defendants made a request to the relevant regulatory authority, an appropriate evaluation would have occurred. The Defendants chose to ignore this process.  
     
      
    28 In terms of the Defendants’ state of mind, the SOAF makes it plain that the Defendants should have known that the NV Act applied to freehold land, knew that the trees were native, knew that clearing could require consent and carried out the clearing for financial gain. Mr Williams, director of Jerilderie Earthmoving, is in the business of land clearing and as a responsible contractor should have made inquiries of relevant authorities such as the local council, catchment management authority or DECC. Such a person in business should ensure they are aware of the law.29 In terms of general deterrence, the Prosecutor submits that a significant fine is required in order for there to be a true deterrent effect on landholders. The decision to illegally clear land is generally taken in a context where the risk of detection is low and the potential financial gain is high. In terms of specific deterrence, the three Defendants continue to farm (and the contractor Defendant continues to run an earthmoving and land clearing business) and a penalty needs to be imposed to ensure that each Defendant does not reoffend. 30 The Prosecutor submits that the objective circumstances of the offence place it in the upper range of seriousness.  
     
      
      
      Defendants’ submissions 
      
    31 The harm to the environment is that set out in the SOAF. It should be noted that it is not alleged by the Prosecutor that the vegetation was of high conservation value, that there was any damage to any endangered ecological community, that there was any impact upon threatened species or that there were serious consequences of the type identified in Rae at [38] including an impact on biodiversity in the region. The environmental harm should be characterised as low to moderate as it is limited to the loss of vegetation in respect of which permission may have been given to clear either by a development consent or a property vegetation plan. Remediation of this harm will be achieved by remediation and the plan to exclude 47 hectares of the property from agricultural activities, which is double the cleared area. Although the harm was foreseeable, the risk of the harm is reduced by the potential for remediation.32 The Defendants’ state of mind at the time of the offence was that they did not know consent was required or that consent may have been required so as to consider making enquiries or seeking advice. The offence was carried out deliberately but without knowledge of its illegality. The failure by any of the Defendants to make inquiries was not negligent. The Prosecutor’s submission that the Defendants, particularly Jerliderie Earthmoving, ought to have known that development consent was required does not establish negligence. The arrangement between the directors of Iroch and Calman with Mr Williams commenced in 2004, the NV Act commenced in December 2005 and the clearing commenced in September 2006. The failure to make inquiries was not negligent, particularly where there is no evidence that information was provided by the Prosecutor or anyone else which would prompt an inquiry. 
     
      
    33 As a matter of objective fact it is accepted that a reasonable person would foresee the risk of harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment by the clearing of vegetation. What should be factored in is the potential for remediation and therefore the risk of harm is less. 
     
      
    34 In terms of mitigating the harm, the Defendants could have refrained from the clearing although they were not aware that there was a need for development consent or the approval of a property vegetation plan.35 In terms of the reasons for committing the offence, it is accepted that Calman and Iroch carried out the clearing in order to improve the agricultural output of the property. The scope of the clearing in relation to the overall operations of the two companies at the property meant it was a very modest improvement. Jerilderie Earthmoving gained no financial advantage from any improvement on the land.36 The Defendants submit that due to the low degree of harm to the environment, the unintentional commission of the offence without knowledge of its illegality and the modest potential increase in the value of the land, the offence should be considered to be of a low objective gravity.  
     
      
      Finding on objective circumstances 
      
    37 The nature of an offence under s 12 of the NV Act is discussed in Rae at [15] – [19]. This must be assessed in light of the objects of the legislation which are aimed at the prevention of broad scale clearing and the promotion of the management of native vegetation, inter alia. Clearing of native vegetation cannot be carried out without consent which in turn requires environmental impact assessment. The need to uphold the regulatory system is recognised in various authorities identified in Rae at [18]. 
     
      
    38 The offences are strict liability so that mens rea is not an element of the offence. Whether the offences were carried out recklessly, intentionally or negligently is relevant to assess the objective circumstances of the offences (Gittany Constructions Pty Ltd v Sutherland Shire Council (2006) 145 LGERA 189 at [123], Hudson at [75]).  
     
      
    39 While aspects of the SOAF were relied on by the Prosecutor as demonstrating that the Defendants should have known the NV Act applied and that the clearing of native vegetation required development consent, there is no evidence to support such a submission beyond the usual principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse. The Prosecutor submitted (par 28) that the SOAF makes plain that the Defendants should have known that the clearing would require consent. The SOAF highlights a different circumstance which is that the Defendants failed to make inquiries of relevant authorities as to whether consent was required for the clearing (SOAF par 57-60). Their evidence is that they were unaware of any requirement such as the NV Act and therefore the need to make inquiries. The issue therefore is whether that failure to make inquiries was negligent, as submitted in oral submission by the Prosecutor.  
     
      
    40 The Prosecutor’s reliance on the condition of development consent granted on 21 September 2004 for the construction of a house on part of the property by Davis Saunders Homes Pty Ltd on behalf of the landholders which refers to restrictions under the NV Act (SOAF par 26) is not relevant. There is no evidence, such as in a record of interview, that the Defendants were aware of this development consent condition. 
     
      
    41 The Prosecutor submitted that the facts in Rae were relevant. The facts of that matter are different to the facts in this matter. In Rae the defendant was aware of possibly needing consent to clear native vegetation on the land which was cleared and made a deliberate decision to clear the native vegetation, without applying for and obtaining consent, in the knowledge that to do so was illegal. Apart from the passage of the NV Act and its coming into force on 1 December 2005, about ten months before the commencement of the offence period, there is no evidence in this matter from the Prosecutor about how the Defendants would be aware of the NV Act such as, for example, whether there was any publicity about the legislation when it was passed.  
     
      
    42 The Prosecutor submits that the Defendants should all have known about the NV Act requirements particularly Mr Williams, given his business of twenty years is land clearing. While that is true and ignorance of the law is no excuse, asserting that fact alone does not give rise to a finding that the Defendants acted negligently. They acted in ignorance and are guilty of a strict liability offence. There was no prior warning about, or knowledge of, the NV Act. There is no evidence of what publicity was provided to the public about the NV Act which came into force in December 2005. This must be weighed up with the fact that a similar offence for land clearing of native vegetation existed since January 1998 in the NVC Act. The Prosecutor has the onus of establishing such matters beyond reasonable doubt in sentencing (R v Olbrich (2000) 117 A Crim R 326). It has not established negligence in the commission of the offence in relation to the failure of the Defendants to make inquiries. 
     
      
       
      Environmental harm caused by the offence 
      
    43 The agreed position on environmental harm is set out above at par 12-13. The table of tree piles observed at the property by DECC officers, which is set out at par 51 of the SOAF, shows that a total of 2383 stems with a diameter greater than 15cm were observed. A sample of diameters in the table demonstrates a number of these stems were mature. This is confirmed by the agreement of the experts as set out in par 13 which refers to the maturity of trees cleared and that smaller trees were probably mulched or burnt as there were none in the woodpiles. The environmental harm caused was significant given the age of the trees cleared and the size of the area cleared being 21 hectares. 
     
      
    44 A relevant consideration in relation to environmental harm is that the NV Act is seeking to address the cumulative effect of clearing native vegetation without adequate environmental assessment on individual properties. The Act is regulating the clearing of native vegetation regardless of whether it is an endangered ecological community or is identified as having other special qualities. Continuing incremental and unchecked loss of native vegetation is also a relevant environmental harm to consider. Loss of mature vegetation removes habitat for native animals and reduces biodiversity in the immediate area. The level of environmental harm was foreseeable and preventable, as the Defendants’ counsel correctly accepted.  
     
      
    45 The level of environmental harm should not be reduced as the Defendants’ counsel submitted because remediation has been and is to be undertaken. Given the scale of clearing, adequate remediation will take many years to achieve. Nor can its success be guaranteed. That is a matter relevant to consider in relation to matters in mitigation. 
     
      
      
      Reasons for committing the offence 
      
    46 The reasons for committing the offence can be taken into account in measuring its objective seriousness, per Axer Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 113 LGERA 35 at 366. The reasons for the offence are referred to in the record of interview summarised in par 57-59 of the SOAF and in the Defendant directors’ affidavits. 
     
      
    47 It is relevant that the clearing was undertaken for commercial gain, in the case of the landowners in pursuit of agricultural activities on the land. Consistent with this use, vegetation was thinned to enable cattle to run, to enable cultivation for cropping and/or grazing, to remove dead suckers to minimise fire hazard and to gain better access, as parts of the property were impassable. There was no plan to use the timber other than for firewood. Jerilderie Earthmoving also gained a benefit by gaining an opportunity to graze cattle on the cleared land, albeit in lieu of being paid for the clearing work. In these circumstances a nominal fine will not provide an economic disincentive for clearing of native vegetation. 
     
      
      Maximum penalty 
      
    48 The Court is to have regard to the maximum penalty applicable, as this is an expression of the seriousness Parliament attributes to the offence: see Camilleri's Stock Feeds Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 32 NSWLR 683 at 698. The maximum fine is $1.1 million. The offence period is from 27 September 2006 to 24 May 2007, a period of approximately seven months. A daily penalty of up to $110,000 per day can also be imposed but that is not sought by the Prosecutor. These are substantial maximum penalties. 
     
      
    49 In relation to the objective circumstances the Defendants’ culpability is low, however the environmental harm is reasonably substantial. 
     
      
      General deterrence 
      
    50 Sentences made in relation to environmental offences must embrace powerful considerations of general deterrence, see Axer per Badgery-Parker J at 367. In Axer, Mahoney J stated at 359: 
     
      
       
        
        The quantum of the fines which the legislation allows to be imposed has no doubt been fixed not merely to indicate the seriousness with which such pollution is regarded but also to deter those engaged in such activities and to procure that they will take the precautions necessary to ensure that it does not occur. 
        
       
      
    51 The Prosecutor argued that general deterrence is an important consideration in light of s 3A(b) of the CSP Act which provides that one of the purposes of sentencing is to “prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences”. As stated in Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Wilton [2008] NSWLEC 297 at [77], there is a need to uphold the integrity of the system of protecting and preserving native vegetation and a strong warning should be sent that offences will result in significant consequences. Offences under the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997, which has the same general aim as the NV Act being protection of the environment, have also emphasised the need for general deterrence in environmental cases, see Camilleri’s Stock Feeds at 701 and Environment Protection Authority v Robinson [2004] NSWLEC 629. Nominal fines will not deter the commission of environmental offences, per Environment Protection Authority v Capdate Pty Ltd (1992) 78 LGERA 349 at 354 and Bentley at [149]. 
     
      
    52 General deterrence is important in light of the aim of the NV Act to prevent clearing of native vegetation without consent; see Rae at [9], Hudson at [81]-[88]. That is important as I agree with the Prosecutor that I can take judicial notice of long standing difficulties for government in managing uncontrolled native vegetation clearances in NSW. 
     
      
      Specific deterrence 
      
    53 None of the Defendants has any prior criminal convictions, which is relevant to specific deterrence. As identified in the majority judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ in Veen v The Queen [No. 2] (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477, past criminal behaviour indicates:  
     
      
       
        
        …whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law.  
        
       
      
    54 The Prosecutor submitted that as the Defendants will continue to farm, the penalty must be sufficient to ensure that they do not reoffend. The contractor Defendant, as an earthmoving and land clearing business, will also continue to clear land. The Defendants submitted that this was their first offence. Each of the directors of the Defendants has expressed remorse and regret on behalf of the company by swearing an affidavit (see Newcastle City Council v Pepperwood Ridge (2004) 132 LGERA 388 at [29]). Each has recognised the mistake, and understands the importance of complying with the Act. They are unlikely to reoffend. I agree. 
     
      
      Mitigating factors/subjective factors 
      
    55 There are a number of mitigating factors that should be taken into account to reduce any penalty, as referred to in s 21A(3) of the CSP Act. 
     
      
      No prior convictions – s 21A(3)(e) CSP Act 
      
    56 The Defendants have no prior convictions. 
     
      
      Good character – s 21A(3)(f) CSP Act  
      
    57 The excellent character of each of the directors of the respective Defendants was evidenced by the character references tendered. I accept that the Defendants are of good character. 
     
      
       
      Contrition and remorse – s 21A(3)(i) CSP Act 
      
    58 All the Defendants, through the affidavits of their respective directors and in character references, have expressed contrition and remorse. The Defendants have accepted responsibility for the offence and have acknowledged the environmental harm caused. They seek to rectify the harm by remediation works, SOAF par 62. It was also submitted that this shows that the Defendants are unlikely to re-offend in the future (s 21A(3)(g)). I accept these submissions. 
     
      
       
      Guilty plea – s 21A(3)(k), s 22 CSP Act 
      
    59 The Defendants pleaded guilty. A plea of guilty entitles a defendant to a discount in penalty under s 22 of the CSP Act 1999 in the range of 10-25 per cent; see R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; R v Sharma (2002) 54 NSWLR 300. The plea of guilty was at the fourth directions hearing and the discount should not be the maximum of 25 per cent, see R v Borkowski, [2009] NSWCCA 102 referred to in Rae at [63. The Prosecutor and the Defendants agree that a discount of 20 per cent is appropriate.Cooperation with law enforcement authorities – s 21A(3)(m), s 23 CSP Act60 The Defendants have cooperated with the Prosecutor at all stages of the investigation of the offences.  
     
      
      Evenhandedness 
      
    61 The principle of evenhandedness requires that the Court consider if there is any sentencing pattern for like offences in order to determine a consistent approach to penalty. This principle must always be applied subject to the particular circumstances of the case before the Court; see Axer at 365. There have been two prosecutions under s 12(1) of the NV Act to date, being Hudson and Rae. Relevant cases under the previous NVC Act (now repealed) are Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Taylor [2007] NSWLEC 530 and Wilton (2008). These and earlier cases such as Wilkinson were considered in Rae also and I refer for completeness to [79] – [83] of that judgment. For the reasons identified by Preston J these cases are not comparable. 
     
      
      
      Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1997 (repealed) 
      
    62 Taylor was a prosecution under s 21(2) of the NVC Act. Approximately 30.5 hectares of native vegetation was cleared. The actual harm to the environment was held by Lloyd J to be significant, including clearing vegetation comprising an endangered ecological community. The defendant knew that there was legislation regulating land clearing but denied knowledge of the precise legislation or the department responsible for administering legislation regulating the clearing of vegetation. The objective circumstances of the crime were considered by his Honour to be of moderate seriousness. Mitigating factors considered were the absence of prior convictions and the early plea of guilty. There was some evidence of contrition and remorse including in the offer to remediate the land although the extent of the contrition was tempered by untruthful and misleading statements made by the defendant in the investigation phase to the prosecutor. Lloyd J considered that the appropriate penalty was a fine of $30,000, discounted by 33 per cent for all mitigating factors, resulting in a fine of $20,000 of a maximum $1.1 million.63 Wilton was another prosecution under s 21(2) of the NVC Act. Biscoe J fined the defendant $30,000 on one charge and $10,000 on another charge for clearing native vegetation on the eastern and western parts of the defendant’s property respectively. The maximum penalty was $1.1 million. His Honour also ordered the defendant to pay the prosecutor’s costs of $30,000 in total. The land cleared in the eastern part was between 13.1 and 13.5 hectares and was 18.3 hectares in the western part. There was actual environmental harm caused by commission of the offence but his Honour held that it was relatively moderate as it had not adversely affected any threatened species, populations or ecological communities. The defendant cleared the land for the purpose of commercial planting and harvesting of trees for profit. The defendant believed that the clearing was exempted from a requirement for development consent under the Act. The Court found that the defendant made a serious and careless error in forming that belief. Mitigating factors considered were the absence of prior convictions, the defendant’s good character, his full assistance to the prosecution, the plea of guilty at the earliest available time, his expression of remorse, acceptance of responsibility for his actions and acknowledgment of the damage caused, a donation by the defendant of the felled timber to charities and compliance with a remediation order. In respect of the charge for clearing the eastern area, Biscoe J added $10,000 to the fine that was considered to be otherwise appropriate with the object of negating the net financial advantage that the defendant would otherwise obtain.  
     
      
      
      Offences under Native Vegetation Act 2003 
      
    64 Hudson, delivered in January 2009 and dealing with an offence committed between November 2007 and March 2007, was the first prosecution under s 12(1) of the NV Act and concerned the clearing of 486 hectares of native vegetation. The defendant pleaded not guilty. In finding the defendant guilty, Lloyd J held that the offence was committed deliberately and after the defendant had been told expressly by an officer of the relevant regulatory authority that native trees must be retained on the land. The offence was committed to make the land more available for agriculture and hence for commercial gain and the harm to the environment caused by the offence was substantial. Lloyd J stated that there was a need for both individual deterrence and general deterrence. The objective gravity of the offence was considered by his Honour to be high. There were few mitigating factors as there was no plea of guilty, no assistance to the investigating or prosecuting regulatory authority, no expression of contrition or remorse and there was no remediation or offer to remediate the environment harmed by the offence. The defendant was, however, a first offender. The defendant was fined $400,000 of a maximum $1.1 million and ordered to pay the prosecutor’s costs. The defendant was also fined $8,000 for failing to comply with a notice issued under s 36(2) of the NV Act.  
     
      
    65 In Rae the defendant pleaded guilty to an offence under s 12(1) of the NV Act. An area of 215 hectares was partially cleared, including an area of 155 hectares which was cleared of 95 per cent of all trees. Most of the trees cleared were mature and some were in excess of 17m in height. The defendant admitted to investigators that he knew that he needed consent for the clearing but went ahead without seeking consent. The clearing was held to be premeditated and intentionally carried out with knowledge of its seriousness. The trees were cleared to improve the property by making it more viable for agricultural purposes and to increase its capital value. The native vegetation which was cleared had significant conservation status and contributed to biodiversity. Preston J held that there was a high degree of environmental harm and the seriousness of this harm was considered an aggravating factor in sentencing. The defendant agreed to a direction by the prosecutor to carry out remediation of the site. Overall the offence was considered to be of medium objective gravity. Mitigating factors considered were the absence of prior offences, the defendant’s good character, the defendant’s guilty plea (though not at the earliest opportunity), his expression of contrition and remorse and his assistance in the investigation. A fine of $160,000 was imposed.  
     
      
      
      Environment Protection And Biodiversity Conservation Act 
       1999 (Cth) 
      
    66 Greentree (No 3) was also referred to in Hudson and Rae. Sackville J imposed a fine of $300,000 on a corporate defendant (maximum penalty $5.5 million) and $150,000 for an individual defendant (maximum penalty $550,000) for clearing of 100 hectares on private land in breach of the Environment Protection And Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth). The clearing impacted on a protected Ramsar wetland area. 
     
      
    67 The Prosecutor submitted that the most comparable case was Rae. The Prosecutor also submitted that Wilton was comparable to this matter as the area cleared was similar and the defendant in that case acted erroneously under a misapprehension about the age of some trees. The objective gravity of the offence in Wilton was said to be less than in the present cases. The contractor, Jerilderie Earthmoving, in particular made a serious and careless error given its business is land clearing. 68 The Defendants submit that this case is significantly less serious than Hudson and Rae and also less serious than Wilton and Taylor. I agree that in this matter the culpability of the Defendants is significantly less than in Rae and Hudson. It is less serious than in Taylor. The circumstances are most similar to Wilton although in that case the defendant was held to have made a significant error in undertaking the clearing. The environmental harm in this matter is similar in that the area of land cleared is similar. I otherwise refer to my findings on environmental harm in par 43-45. 
     
      
      
      Costs 
      
    69 The Defendants have agreed to pay the Prosecutor’s costs of $73,000. The Prosecutor accepts that if such an order is made, this may be considered in the setting of an appropriate penalty, see EPA v Barnes [2006] NSWCCA 246.  
     
      
      
      Totality v parity 
      
    70 The Defendants submitted that a variation of the totality principle ought to apply so that a single penalty should be divided across the three Defendants. The totality principle in sentencing is a well-established principle of sentencing to be applied by the court when sentencing an offender for more than one offence. It requires a judge to determine an appropriate sentence for each offence, consider questions of cumulation or concurrence and then, when reviewing the aggregate sentence, consider whether it is “just and appropriate”; see Johnson v R (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [18]. 71 The three Defendants are essentially co-defendants. The parity principle as between co-offenders was considered by the High Court in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606. Gibbs CJ stated the principle at 609 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        It is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are no[t] always equal, such matters as the age, background, criminal history and general character of the offender and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence have to be taken into account. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      This statement was cited in  
      R v Canino 
       [2002] NSWCCA 76 and is referred to in the Judicial Commission of New South Wales,  
      Sentencing Bench Book  
      (10th edition, October 2008). This principle of parity is the appropriate sentencing principle rather than a variation of the totality principle as submitted by the Defendants’ counsel. The totality principle operates where a single defendant is charged with multiple offences arising from the same circumstances so that the level of penalty for subsequent offences is adjusted downwards to reflect the totality of appropriate punishment for that individual. 
      
    72 In all the circumstances I think that the landholder Defendants’ penalties should be the same. I consider that a fine of $22,000 is appropriate. 
     
      
    73 In relation to the Defendant contractor, while I accept the submission that it did not obtain a benefit from the improvement to the land in the same way as the landholders, general deterrence is an important factor in its case given that its business is land clearing. It should receive the same penalty of $22,000.

    1 JOHNSON J: This is an application for bail by Fadi Ibrahim, who is to appear at Central Local Court on 26 November 2009 with respect to a charge of conspiracy to murder. 
     
      
    2 As s.9 Bail Act 1978 does not apply to a charge of conspiracy to murder, there is no presumption in favour of bail: s.9(1)(c). In addition, there is no presumption in favour of bail as the Applicant is charged with an indictable offence and has previously been convicted of an indictable offence: s.9B(3) Bail Act 1978. Accordingly, there is no presumption for or against the grant of bail in this case.  
     
      
    3 The hearing of this application extended over parts of several hearing days - 22, 23, 27 and 30 October 2009. Oral and documentary evidence was adduced, with particular reference to the Applicant’s state of health and the medical treatment which had been provided to him in custody, and which would be available in the event that he remained in custody.  
     
      
       
      The 5 June 2009 Attack 
       
      
    4 The Applicant is 35 years old. On the evening of 5 June 2009, the Applicant was attacked outside his home at Castle Cove and suffered five gunshot wounds, two to the right chest, two to the right arm and one to the right shoulder. He was conveyed to the Royal North Shore Hospital where he received emergency treatment. The medical evidence before the Court indicates that the Applicant received life-threatening injuries requiring surgical intervention.  
     
      
    5 The Applicant remained in hospital until 29 June 2009. During that period, he underwent a total gastrectomy (removal of his whole stomach) and a partial esophagectomy (removal of part of the oesophagus), repair and patching of the right axillary artery and open reduction and internal fixation of the right clavicle.  
     
      
       
      The Alleged Offence 
       
      
    6 The charge against the Applicant alleges a conspiracy between the Applicant, his younger brother Michael Ibrahim, Rodney Atkinson, Amerigo Gerace and Jim Said Habkouk to murder John Macris. The prosecution alleges that the motive for this conspiracy was mainly in retaliation for the attempted murder of the Applicant on 5 June 2009.  
     
      
    7 The case against the Applicant is dependent upon telephone intercept material, and inferences which the Crown submits can be drawn from visits by alleged co-conspirators to Michael Ibrahim at Broken Hill Gaol, and telephone contact between the alleged co-conspirators thereafter. 
     
      
    8 I note that John Macris has not been charged with any offence relating to the attempted murder of the Applicant on 5 June 2009. 
     
      
    9 The Crown alleges that Mr Atkinson visited Michael Ibrahim at Broken Hill Gaol on 5 July 2009 and that the origin of the plan to murder Mr Macris arose at this time. It is alleged that a mobile telephone has been smuggled illegally to Michael Ibrahim inside Broken Hill Gaol.  
     
      
    10 The Crown alleges that between 10 July 2009 and 24 September 2009, a number of intercepted calls indicated that Michael Ibrahim was attempting to ascertain an address for Mr Macris, and other information, from a number of different people. 
     
      
    11 On 29 August 2009, the Applicant, Mr Gerace and a number of other persons are said to have travelled to Broken Hill Gaol and visited Michael Ibrahim. 
     
      
    12 The prosecution relies upon two telephone conversations between Michael Ibrahim and the Applicant on 9 and 10 September 2009. In neither conversation does the Applicant say words which refer to Mr Macris. The prosecution will contend that inferences can be drawn adverse to the Applicant, but this process will depend upon the totality of the evidence and what can be inferred from it. The prosecution contends that the Applicant arranged for a photograph of Mr Macris to be provided to Mr Atkinson. 
     
      
    13 Other telephone calls were intercepted on the evening of 10 September 2009, including a call where it is alleged that Mr Atkinson was contacted by Mr Habkouk using the same mobile telephone used previously by the Applicant and that, during this call, Mr Habkouk arranged to meet with Mr Atkinson. 
     
      
    14 The Crown alleges that further calls were intercepted between 11 and 23 September 2009. On 23 September 2009, an intercept call identified that a pistol was being delivered to Mr Atkinson that night. 
     
      
    15 On 24 September 2009, a search warrant was executed on Mr Atkinson’s home. Police located a .22 Ruger semi-automatic pistol fitted with a suppressor and silencer hidden inside a kitchen cupboard, and a box of ammunition and a holster for the firearm were located on the floor of a bedroom. Located above a cupboard in the kitchen was a black bag containing two photographs of Mr Macris, an address for Mr Macris, two car registration numbers and a loaded .45 calibre semi-automatic pistol, together with a NSW Police identification badge and warrant card. The address that was supplied for Mr Macris was that of a nearby neighbour and not the actual residence of Mr Macris.  
     
      
    16 It is the prosecution case that the conversations between the accused persons demonstrate that a conspiracy existed to murder Mr Macris from 5 July 2009, and that this was only terminated by the intervention of police. It is said that police were forced to act on the information that was available on 24 September 2009, when it became apparent that Mr Atkinson had obtained a firearm and that a wrong address for Mr Macris had been supplied.  
     
      
    17 The items located inside Mr Atkinson’s premises have been subjected to ballistic and fingerprint testing. Detective Sergeant Abdy of the Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad gave evidence that the photographs were found to carry the fingerprints of Mr Atkinson and other persons yet to be identified, but that the Applicant’s fingerprints were not found on the photographs.  
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s Health 
       
      
    18 The Applicant was arrested on 24 September 2009 and has been in custody since then. A range of information was provided at that time to custodial authorities concerning the Applicant’s state of health, his medication and diet and treatment requirements arising from the significant injuries which he sustained on 5 June 2009. 
     
      
    19 The present application came before this Court on 22 October 2009. A substantial volume of medical evidence was tendered on the application. This included a report dated 19 October 2009 of Dr Steven Leibman, surgeon, who performed emergency surgery on the Applicant at the Royal North Shore Hospital, a report dated 15 October 2009 from Dr Rodney Lane, vascular surgeon, who treated the Applicant in hospital, a report dated 18 October 2009 from Dr Richard Lawson, surgeon, who examined the Applicant in his capacity as a brachial plexus and peripheral nerve surgeon and a report from Dr Ashraf Aboud, the Applicant’s general practitioner. 
     
      
    20 These reports concerned the surgical and other medical intervention required whilst the Applicant was an inpatient, and the range of treatments provided to and proposed for the Applicant in the community. These included the use of strong analgesics for continuing pain, a special diet required as a result of the effective removal of the Applicant’s stomach, physiotherapy and psychiatric and psychological review for anxiety and possible post-traumatic stress disorder. 
     
      
    21 The Applicant had been transferred from the MRRC, Silverwater to the Goulburn Correctional Centre on 12 October 2009. The evidence then available (on 22 October 2009) indicated that limited action had been taken by Justice Health to assess and treat the Applicant’s medical conditions whilst in custody. A real question also arose, on the evidence, as to whether necessary medical and associated treatment could be provided whilst the Applicant was housed at Goulburn Correctional Centre. 
     
      
    22 To allow the Court to have a proper and complete understanding of steps which had been taken by Justice Health concerning the Applicant, orders were made which saw the production of documents on 23 October 2009 and the attendance on that day of Dr Stephen Hampton, the Acting Clinical Director for Primary and Women’s Health with Justice Health. The Court is grateful for the assistance provided by Dr Hampton in attending to give evidence on 23 and 30 October 2009, and in undertaking a range of tasks between those two dates concerning the Applicant. 
     
      
    23 It is not necessary to recite in detail in this judgment the steps taken by Justice Health concerning the Applicant between 24 September and 23 October 2009. I note that, on 24 October 2009, the Applicant was transferred from Goulburn to the MRRC. On 27 October 2009, Dr Hampton spoke to the Applicant at the MRRC and developed a plan for his care and treatment should he remain in custody.  
     
      
    24 The Applicant was transferred to Long Bay Hospital on 28 October 2009 and has remained there since. It is apparent, from the evidence, that Long Bay Hospital is the only satisfactory location where the Applicant could be housed in custody, given his current treatment needs and those which can be reasonably anticipated for the foreseeable future. 
     
      
    25 In a report dated 28 October 2009, Dr Hampton addressed a number of issues including the Applicant’s diet, need for physiotherapy, follow-up specialist appointments, pain management and psychiatric assistance.  
     
      
    26 The involvement of Dr Hampton has assisted the Court in forming a realistic view of the ability of the Applicant’s medical issues being managed properly in custody. Although concerns arise from the state of affairs which presented as at 22 October 2009, I am satisfied that an adequate, but not ideal, regime could be put in place to accommodate the Applicant in custody, at least whilst he was housed at Long Bay Hospital. However, any treatment organised by Justice Health outside the prison system could only be provided through the public health system, with the associated inevitable delays which would result in that respect. If the Applicant was at liberty on bail, however, he would be able to undertake medical treatment as a private patient. Apparently, this is not possible for persons in custody. 
     
      
    27 There is no doubt that the medical needs of the Applicant would place considerable demands upon the resources of Justice Health should he remain in custody. Treatment and assessment would be required both inside and outside the prison. There would be ongoing special dietary needs, and the necessity for physiotherapy, as well as ongoing pain management issues. There has been debate during the hearing concerning the identity of appropriate analgesics for use by the Applicant, and the potential difficulties arising from use of methadone, as opposed to other strong medication prescribed for him before he entered custody. I note that the use of methadone was foreshadowed for the Applicant in custody, but that this has not eventuated pending determination of the present application.  
     
      
       
      Submissions of the Parties 
       
      
    28 Mr Galloway, for the Applicant, submitted that conditional bail ought be granted upon stringent conditions, which would ensure attendance of the Applicant at Court and protect the community, whilst at the same time ensuring that the interests of the Applicant in obtaining appropriate medical assistance could be met in the community.  
     
      
    29 Mr Galloway submitted that the case against the Applicant was a weak one, being essentially a circumstantial case, involving inferences which the prosecution said could be drawn from telephone conversations. He emphasised the limited number of telephone conversations involving the Applicant as a participant.  
     
      
    30 In addition, Mr Galloway pointed to the significant delay which would arise given the length of time required by the prosecution to prepare its brief. He submitted that it was not likely that committal proceedings would take place until 2010, with any trial unlikely to take place until late 2010 at best. 
     
      
    31 In closing submissions on 30 October 2009 (T101-105), the Crown did not oppose the grant of bail to the Applicant. The Crown accepted that the Applicant’s medical condition constituted an unusual circumstance which assisted him on the application.  
     
      
    32 With respect to the strength of the prosecution case, although it was disputed that this was a weak Crown case, the Crown acknowledged that, on the available evidence, the role of the Applicant was more limited than the alleged co-offenders.  
     
      
    33 The Crown did not submit that the Applicant would not appear at Court if granted bail, and did not submit that there was a risk of further offences which ought lead to the Applicant being refused bail.  
     
      
    34 The Court was informed that it was the Crown’s considered position, at the end of the hearing, that bail was not opposed and that it was appropriate for bail to be granted in this case upon the stringent conditions proposed as part of the application. 
     
      
    35 Accordingly, at the end of the hearing, both the Applicant and the Crown submitted that it was appropriate to grant the Applicant conditional bail in the terms proposed by the Applicant. I have regard to the fact that it is the Crown’s considered submission, at the end of the hearing which spread over several days between 22 and 30 October 2009, that bail ought be granted to the Applicant. This is not a case where the Crown has rushed to form a view with respect to bail, so that the Crown submission ought be approached in a qualified way.  
     
      
    36 Bail applications in this Court proceed upon the basis of the Court receiving summary material from the Crown concerning the nature and strength of the prosecution case, the risk of commission of further offences if bail is granted and the risk of flight. It is the police and the Crown who have a detailed understanding of the available evidence which serves to inform the Crown position with respect to bail. Where the Crown has reached a considered view that it is appropriate that bail ought be granted, this Court should be loathe to reach a different view. 
     
      
       
      Factors Under s.32  
      Bail Act 1978 
       
      
    37 I should record a number of specific matters under s.32 Bail Act 1978 which bear upon the application. 
     
      
    38 With respect to the probability of the Applicant appearing in Court in answer to the charge, the evidence reveals that the Applicant has significant community ties. He has a prior criminal history, but there is no record of failing to appear. The material indicates a failure to report on one occasion in September 2004, with the Applicant said to have reported the next day and with no subsequent action being taken against him. The Crown did not dispute this account. 
     
      
    39 The charge against the Applicant is a serious one. I do not accept that it can be properly characterised as a weak Crown case, although it is apparent that the prosecution case will depend upon a series of inferences being drawn to implicate the Applicant. If convicted, a substantial custodial sentence would be likely, given the maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years and a standard non-parole period of seven years. 
     
      
    40 The range of factors bearing upon the probability of the Applicant appearing in Court, for the purpose of s.32(1)(a) of the Act, have led the Crown to form the view that bail should not be opposed. I see no reason to reject the Crown’s approach on this aspect. 
     
      
    41 The medical needs of the Applicant bear heavily upon his interests to be considered for the purpose of s.32(1)(b) of the Act. Both the Applicant and the Crown pointed to the period the Applicant would be obliged to spend in custody, and the conditions under which he would be held in custody, with the potential for adverse health outcomes for him (s.32(1)(b)(i)). Reliance was placed by the Applicant upon the need to be free to prepare for his appearance in Court at future proceedings: s.32(1)(b)(ii). These features operate in favour of the Applicant. 
     
      
    42 With respect to the protection and welfare of the community (s.32(1)(c)), I have already referred to the submissions of the Applicant and the Crown concerning the risk of further offences if the Applicant was released on bail. The Crown does not contend that this is an impediment to the grant of bail. 
     
      
    43 There is no presumption for or against the grant of bail. In the circumstances of the case, the Crown has acknowledged that it is appropriate to grant bail, having regard to the accumulation of circumstances, including the Applicant’s significant medical requirements and the stringent conditions proposed for bail. Having regard to the totality of the evidence and the Crown concession, I propose to grant the Applicant conditional bail. 
     
      
       
      Proposed Bail Conditions 
       
      
    44 The bail conditions proposed for the Applicant are indeed stringent. They include: 
     
      
       
      (a) a daily reporting condition; 
       
       
      (b) a residential condition; 
       
       
      (c) a curfew condition; 
       
       
      (d) the requirement that an acceptable person provides security in the sum of $1 million, to be forfeited in the event that the Applicant fails to comply with his bail undertaking; 
       
       
      (e) the requirement that the Applicant surrender his passport and not attend or enter points of international or interstate departure; 
       
       
      (f) a condition that the Applicant not approach or contact any Crown witness, including John Macris, except in specified conditions; 
       
       
      (g) the requirement that the Applicant not contact or associate with any alleged co-offender. 
       
      
    45 It will be a matter for the authorised Justice, before whom the bail undertaking is entered, to determine whether the proposed acceptable person is appropriate, and whether the form of security which is offered is appropriate and acceptable to the Court. 
     
      
    46 I propose to vary the wording of some of the proposed conditions so as to give them greater clarity. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    47 Bail is granted to the Applicant subject to the following conditions: 
     
      
      (a) That the Applicant enters into an agreement to observe the following requirements as to his conduct whilst at liberty on bail: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (i) He is to appear at Central Local Court on 26 November 2009 and at such time and place thereafter as required. 
         
         
        (ii) He is to reside at 3 Neerim Road, Castle Cove in the State of New South Wales. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (iii) He is to report to the officer-in-charge of the Police Station at Chatswood daily between the hours of 8.00 am and 8.00 pm. 
         
          
         
        (iv) One acceptable person is to enter into an agreement, with security, to forfeit the sum of $1 million if the Applicant fails to comply with his bail undertaking. It will be a matter for the authorised person under the  
        Bail Act 1978 
         to determine the suitability of the proposed acceptable person, and the nature and form of security which is offered in accordance with this condition.  
         
        
        
        (v) He is to surrender his passport to the authorised person who admits him to bail, and is to give an undertaking in writing that he will not apply for a new passport or any form of travel documents, throughout his entire bail period. 
         
         
        (vi) He is not to go within 500 metres of any airport or recognised point of overseas departure. 
         
         
        (vii) He is not to go within 500 metres of any airport or recognised point of interstate departure. 
         
         
        (viii) He is not to contact, directly or indirectly, or otherwise associate with his alleged co-offenders, Michael Ibrahim, Rodney Atkinson, Amerigo Gerace or Jim Said Habkouk. 
         
         
        (ix) He is not to contact, directly or indirectly, or approach or cause any third party to approach the alleged victim, John Macris, or any other witnesses which the Crown proposes to call, save through his legal representatives, and only after written notice has been given to the solicitor with carriage of the matter at the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
        
       
       
        
        (x) He is to be subject to a curfew and is not to be absent from the premises at 3 Neerim Avenue, Castle Cove between the hours of 8.30 pm and 6.00 am each day, and is to present himself at the front door of the premises in the event of a police curfew check. 
         
         
        (xi) He is to be of good behaviour in all respects throughout the period of his liberty on bail. 
        
       
       
      (b) Bail is to be automatically revoked in the event of any breach of any one of these conditions, and the Applicant may thereupon be arrested by any police officer. 
       
       
      (c) Bail may be entered into before any person authorised under the

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: This is an appeal against conviction of five sexual assault offences committed against a child, TL, between August 1999 and October 2001 when the child was between the ages of 6 and 8 years. The offences comprised three counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act (counts 1, 3 and 5), a count of indecent assault of a child under 10 years contrary to s 61M(2) (count 2) and a count of inciting a child under 10 years to commit an indecent act contrary to s 61O(2) (count 4). The appellant was sentenced to an overall sentence of 6 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years. There is no application to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    3 There are two grounds of appeal filed: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. Her Honour erred in failing to give directions regarding the evidence of other acts of misconduct. 
         
         
        2. The verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
        
       
      
    4 The facts can be briefly stated. The evidence to prove the charges was that of the complainant who was aged 15 at the time of the trial. There was no evidence in support of her account. There was medical evidence that was treated at the trial as being neutral. The appellant did not give evidence nor did he participate in an interview with investigating police. The defence at the trial was conducted on the basis that the complainant was unreliable. She had not disclosed the offences until May 2002. 
     
      
    5 In 1997 the complainant’s mother commenced a relationship with the appellant. In 1999 the family commenced to live in Belmore. The appellant stayed at those premises most nights and would often baby-sit the complainant and her sister when the mother went to play Bingo or go shopping. The complainant alleged that on these occasions the appellant sexually interfered with her. The relationship was terminated in September 2001 and the complainant spoke to her aunt about the appellant’s conduct in May 2002. Police interviewed the complainant on two occasions in July 2002. The appellant’s whereabouts were unknown at that time and he was not arrested until 2007. 
     
      
    6 The complainant gave evidence by closed-circuit television. The evidence included the playing of the two interviews with police. During the course of the first interview the complainant became upset after general questions had been asked about the family and the appellant. She was given the opportunity to write down what had happened with the appellant. She wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Every time my mum went shopping he would take all his clothes off and tell [L, (her sister)] to go and have a bath and stay in there for long, and my brother TJ would be at P.C.Y.C. And he would call me and tell me to put my tongue in his mouth, and I had to because he forced me to do it. And he took his undies off and told me to take mine off, and he forced me to do it, otherwise he would pretend he was going to hit me, and white stuff was coming out of his rude part, and when he took off his clothes he put his rude part into mine and move up and down, and when he heard my mum open the door he would get up and quickly run into the room and pretend he was getting changed, and told me to run into the toilet. 
        
       
      
    7 The complainant was then asked: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q247 So, [T], you said here that every time when your mum went shopping, how many times did this happen? 
         
         
        A Every time. 
        
       
      
    8 The complainant later said that she had forgotten to write something down and said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        When I was asleep he was, took his clothes off and he started taking mine off and he put his thing, rude part into mine when I was asleep. 
        
       
       
      She said that he told her to suck his rude part but she did not do it. 
       
      
    9 She said that the first time the appellant did rude things to her he told her to put a skirt on and come back to him when she had done it. He was telling her to put her tongue in his mouth and he pulled her skirt off and took off his pants. He put his rude part into hers. He then heard her sister getting out of the shower and he stopped, telling her to pretend she was drawing. This incident gave rise to the first count on the indictment. She said it occurred when she was aged 7 and on a Saturday because TJ was at the football. The appellant told her not to tell her mum or he would hit her. 
     
      
    10 The appellant told her to go to her mother’s room and lie on the bed. He then got on top of her. He pulled her skirt up and pulled down her undies. He took off the sarong he was wearing and was naked. He put his rude part into her with his hand. She could feel him inside her and it hurt. This continued until her sister got out of the bath and she could hear the water going down the drain. As he was doing this he rubbed her boobs. This conduct gave rise to count 2. 
     
      
    11 In the second interview conducted two days after the first, the complainant said that the appellant stopped doing rude things to her before he went on holidays to Queensland but she could not say when that was. She could not say how many times the abuse took place but it happened every time her Mum went shopping every Monday and whenever she went to visit someone. 
     
      
    12 The complainant gave an account of an incident when she was sleeping in her bedroom. Her sister L was also in the room. It was night and she woke up because a light was in her eyes. She saw the appellant and he was putting his rude part into hers. This incident gave rise to count 3. He had come into the room and taken his boxer shorts and undies off. He did not say anything to her. He moved up and down and it hurt her. 
     
      
    13 On another occasion she was in bed doing her homework. He told her, “Suck my rude part”. She pretended she was not listening. This incident gave rise to count 4. The appellant then told her sister to go and have a bath and he went into the lounge room. It was after school and the complainant was in her uniform. He lifted up her dress and took off her undies. He was wearing a sarong and took down his undies. He told her to put her homework away and then he put his rude part into hers. This complaint gave rise to count 5. 
     
      
    14 During the course of the complainant’s evidence she said that there were only three occasions that something happened between the appellant and her. In cross-examination she agreed that in the interviews she said that something happened whenever her mother went out. She denied that she was lying in the interview but admitted that she was lying in her evidence because she was embarrassed. When asked why she lied in her evidence, she said. “Because I don’t, like it happened more than three times, but like I don’t know like when, it did happen every time I remember now, but like these are like the main story like you said”. She confirmed that she had lied when she said that it only happened three times. She said that she was embarrassed and did not want to deal with it anymore. When asked why she lied to take away the embarrassment, she said, “Because that means I just have to come back to court for the other times too”. 
     
      
    15 The complainant’s aunt gave evidence that the complainant had told her that the appellant had done things to her as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        She said that she, told me that he made her put his thing in her mouth, that he licked her on her thing, he put it in her, in her thing, that’s the word she used with me, he kissed her and stuck his tongue in her mouth, he rubbed white stuff on her over her chest under, like on her bare skin. 
        
       
       
      She asked the complainant how often it happened and she had replied whenever her mum went to Bingo or shopping, whenever she was left there and at night. 
       
      
    16 She gave evidence that the complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [The appellant] used to go in my room at night and he would try to get my undies off and sometimes he would put his finger in my thing. 
        
       
       
      The complainant also said that he “put his finger in my bum”. 
       
      
    17 The complainant’s mother gave evidence about her relationship with the appellant and the sleeping arrangements in the house. 
     
      
    18 The complainant’s elder sister, CP, gave evidence about the sleeping arrangements and confirmed that the appellant looked after her sisters when she and her mother would go to Bingo or shopping. 
     
      
    19 Dr Norrie, a forensic physician, considered the notes of Dr Chan who had examined the complainant in August 2002. That examination revealed a normal hymen with no signs of trauma. There was a small notch or ridge on the hymen that Dr Norrie thought was a non-specific finding and could be either a normal variant or a previous transection, that is a tear or laceration to the hymeneal tissue, that had healed. She expressed the view that the findings were not necessarily inconsistent with the complainant’s version depending upon how far the sexual organs had been penetrated. She stated that, if there were entries of a penis into the vagina once a week over a two-year period, it was unlikely that any damage would have healed. 
     
      
    20 The Crown opened to the jury. She outlined the facts upon which each of the counts in the indictment was based. She also said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Now I expect you’ll hear that from the time [the complainant] was living at the Belmore address until about September 2001, when her mother was no longer seeing the accused, that the accused would often have sexual intercourse with her when her mother would go out of the house. And I expect you will hear that given the passage of time, she is unable to detail every incident. 
        
       
       
      Defence counsel opened to the jury shortly and indicated that the defence case was “that the conduct alleged by [the complainant] did not happen”. 
       
      
    21 At the request of the defence and at the conclusion of the evidence-in-chief of the complainant’s aunt, the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Members of the jury, I should tell you that that evidence of the conversations between the complainant [TL] and [her aunt] is not before you as evidence of the truth of what was said by the complainant, but this evidence is led by the Crown in order to attempt to re-establish the credit of the complainant, that is [TL]. I'll give you further directions at the end of the trial about how you are to treat this evidence of these conversations which is called evidence of complaint in some circumstances, but here its to re-establish credit. 
        
       
      
    22 The summing up was appropriately brief having regard to the evidence before the jury and the way that the trial had been conducted by the parties. At the conclusion of the summing up her Honour was asked to redirect the jury on a number of matters and complied with the requests. After she had sent the jury out to consider its verdict the following occurred (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        Trial Advocate 
        : Your Honour just as I sit here now thinking and I appreciate you've sent the jury out again, whether or not it is appropriate to give a direction in relation - I think your Honour has given a direction about the complaint evidence which referred to uncharged acts.  
        There is no evidence of uncharged acts themselves but there is evidence in the complaint of ""other acts"". 
         Now your Honour said that it is not to be evidence of the truth, I'm just wondering, to be prudent, that they are not to substitute or give a warning in relation to that and the only relevance of that evidence was to, well it actually went to her credibility but I suppose it also went to discredit her, it was used by the defence to discredit her. 
         
         
        Her Honour 
        : Well I suppose I'll send a message in then not to - that there will be - I'm not going to do it now then. Mr Fernandez (defence counsel) I think I should send a message in not to - whether or not they deliberate or not is another thing, well they can't reach a final verdict, but that there will be a further direction after they’ve finished their lunch, say 10 past 2. 
         
         
        FERNANDEZ 
        : Thank you your Honour. 
         
         
        Her Honour 
        : Could you just make sure they have that message, that they are not to reach a final verdict. There will be a further direction given after, say about 10 past two. 
        
       
      
    23 After the luncheon adjournment the following took place: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Her Honour 
        : Just before we have the jury I think I will just clarify with the direction that you suggest Mr Fernandez. I thought I would use the context direction in the bench book but modify it just to refer to the [complainant's] evidence of other alleged acts - 
         
         
        Trial Advocate 
        : It is not - see that is the thing it is not her evidence of other - it is only the events from [the aunt] that there is - so there is no evidence for them to find that there were uncharged acts because there is just evidence that was only led for the limited purpose of her credibility in relation to telling [her aunt] that he put it in her thing, that -  
         
         
        Her Honour 
        : I see, but what about the fact that there are uncharged acts of - every Monday night or whatever that was, they are the other acts as well. 
         
         
        Trial Advocate 
        : Yes. 
         
         
        Her Honour 
        : So that is evidence from her not going to the charges on the indictment -  
         
         
        Trial Advocate 
        : Yes that is right. 
         
         
        Her Honour 
        : - but there is evidence from the complainant that there were other -  
         
         
        Trial Advocate 
        : Acts although they are unspecified yes. 
         
         
        FERNANDEZ: Yes your Honour I did -  
         
         
        HER HONOUR: I think those - but what she told [her aunt] is not evidence of those acts, right and then I would give the direction that you must not use this evidence of other acts as establishing – you must not substitute the evidence of the other acts for the evidence of the specific offences charged. Something as basic as that. 
         
         
        FERNANDEZ: Yes 
         
         
        TRIAL ADVOCATE: Yes 
         
         
        HER HONOUR: So - otherwise it brings in -- 
         
         
        TRIAL ADVOCATE: Yes other irrelevant material. 
         
         
        HER HONOUR: Yes. All right. I will have the jury then thank you. 
        
       
      
    24 When the jury returned to court her Honour directed them as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………..As I have made it clear before you can convict the accused in respect of any count on the indictment, you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that particular offence has been proved to have been committed. Now in addition to the evidence led by the Crown specifically directed to those five counts, you have heard other evidence from the complainant, [TL], about other things that happened – on Monday nights or whenever her mother was out. 
         
         
        You have also heard from [her aunt] about other alleged acts, such (as) touching the complainant on other parts of the body et cetera, but that is not evidence of the truth of those acts alleged. I am directing you that that is not evidence of those acts, in any event.  
         
         
        In respect of the evidence from the complainant that other things happened, unspecified things – but other acts of assault, you cannot substitute the evidence of those other acts for the evidence of the specific offences charged. So, you are only dealing with the specific offences, not some general rolled up allegation of other unspecified acts. I hope that is understandable.” 
        
       
       
      Neither counsel sought any further direction on this topic. 
       
       
      Ground 1 Direction on uncharged acts 
      
    25 The concern raised by the prosecutor about “uncharged acts” related only to the evidence of complaint to the aunt. The prosecutor was not conscious that the evidence of the complainant herself raised “uncharged acts”. But it is clear that her Honour was sensitive to the issue that there was evidence both from the complainant directly and through the aunt, of other sexual acts committed by the appellant against her. The evidence of other acts coming from the complainant’s evidence was very general being merely an allegation that the appellant did things to her whenever her mother went out and he was left to baby-sit her and her sister. The allegations to the aunt were of other incidents specific in detail but unspecific as to when they occurred. 
     
      
    26 In relation to what the complainant said to her aunt, her Honour dealt with the issue by directing the jury that they were not to treat them as evidence of the truth of what the complainant said, but that they went to re-establish her credit. Counsel appearing for the appellant in this Court accepted that the present ground of appeal did not relate to reference in the aunt’s evidence of “uncharged acts”. 
     
      
    27 The complaint under this ground is that the trial judge should have given the jury a direction against using the evidence of the complainant as tendency evidence; that is her Honour should have warned the jury against reasoning that, because the complainant said that the appellant committed sexual acts against her whenever her mother went out, he was more likely to have committed the particular acts set out in the counts on the indictment. 
     
      
    28 As will be noted from the part of the transcript extracted above, it was the prosecution advocate who raised the issue of evidence of “other acts” and whether some direction should be given about them, but only in respect of the evidence of complaint to the aunt. After the luncheon adjournment her Honour brought to the attention of the parties that the evidence of the complainant referred to other acts and suggested that she might use the “context direction in the bench book”. But her Honour was in effect deflected from taking that course by both counsel who expressed agreement with the proposal that the Judge merely direct the jury against substituting general evidence for the particular evidence led in respect of each of the counts on the indictment. 
     
      
    29 In light of what happened at the trial the appellant relied upon an affidavit of defence counsel at the trial to the effect that he overlooked seeking a direction in relation to the “use of the uncharged acts” and that this was a mistake rather than a tactical error. I indicated in R v Moussa [2001] NSWCCA 427; 125 A Crim R 505 that such an affidavit would not necessarily overcome the effect of rule 4 where counsel failed to take a point at trial. With the concurrence of Giles JA and Carruthers AJ, I stated:  
     
      
       
        
         
        [58] It has been my experience, limited as it is, that counsel appearing for the appellant in this Court often consider that it is sufficient to justify the grant of leave under r4 that an affidavit is placed before the Court from trial counsel to the effect that, as best as counsel can recall, there was no tactical reason for the failure to take the point. Often trial counsel admits that he or she never thought to take the objection, or was unaware that a direction or warning, such as that raised on appeal, was required. Frequently the material simply indicates that counsel can no longer recall why he or she did not seek the direction or take the objection that is the subject of the ground of appeal. 
         
         
        [59] It seems timely to repeat again what Hunt J had to say in R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536: 
         
          
           
          ""The requirements of r4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside. One purpose of the requirement that no misdirection or nondirection may without leave be allowed as a ground of appeal unless objection was taken at the trial is to ensure that the trial judge receives the assistance from counsel to which he or she is entitled in the task of giving appropriate directions to the jury. If a summing-up contains some error which could easily have been cured once the judge's attention had been drawn to it and if counsel for the accused to whose detriment the error fails to comply with his or her duties to draw the judge's attention to that error, any suggestion that such detriment automatically entitles the accused to a new trial does not strike a sympathetic chord in the hearts of those who see the right to a fair trial as operating in favour not only of the accused but also of the Crown which prosecutes on behalf of the whole community. The Criminal Appeal Act 1912 does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted under one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which he could and should have raised at the first trial."" 
          
         
         
        [60] It may well be the case that, if the failure to seek a direction or warning was a result of a considered and competent decision made for tactical reasons, it would be virtually impossible for the appellant to obtain leave to rely upon the point because no miscarriage of justice could have occurred. But in my view it should not be taken to be the case that leave will automatically be granted simply because the proffered explanation is that counsel overlooked the point or was unaware of the law on the subject. Nor is it more likely that leave will be granted simply because counsel can no longer indicate why the point was not taken at the trial. 
         
         
        [61] Nor can bald assertions by trial counsel that there was no tactical reason for a failure to take the point always be taken at face value. This is not to suggest that trial counsel would seek to mislead this Court, but counsel cannot be expected, many months after the event, to recall accurately the atmosphere of the trial or the circumstances in which decisions were made during the course of it. Tactical choices are often made on the spur of the moment as the trial takes on a certain complexion, for example, because of a change in the evidence in the Crown case. 
         
         
        [62] Indeed, in light of the experience of this Court over the last ten years, of which the instant case is a good example, a real question arises as to whether the Court should any longer expect an appellant, seeking to overcome the impact of r4, to provide an explanation from trial counsel as to why the relevant objection was not taken or the relevant direction not sought. There may be rare occasions when real assistance can be derived from such material in amplification of the transcript. But generally speaking it seems to me to amount to no more than an imposition on trial counsel for little, or no, good purpose. 
         
         
        [63] At the end of the day the question, with which this Court is concerned, is whether the conduct of the trial may have resulted in a miscarriage of justice and that question is not necessarily answered in favour of the appellant simply because of decisions, errors or oversights by counsel falling short of incompetence. Trial counsel has a duty both to the client and the Court to take objections or seek re-directions where appropriate: R v Roberts [2001] NSWCCA 163. Like other aspects of the conduct of defence counsel during the course of the trial, a failure to seek a direction or warning will not necessarily result in a miscarriage of justice, even if counsel was negligent: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685. If leave is required under r4, then the applicant has to persuade this court that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred before leave is granted: Tripodina and Morabito (1988) 35 A Crim R 183 at 191; R v Williamson and Morrell (NSWCCA, 11 October 1991). On the other hand, if the point is taken at trial, the Crown will have the onus of persuading this Court that there had been no substantial miscarriage of justice: Clarke (1995) 78 A Crim R 226. 
         
        
       
       
      This statement has been applied by this Court on subsequent occasions; see for example  
      Fung v R 
       [2007] NSWCCA 250; 174 A Crim R 169. 
       
      
    30 With respect and appreciating that counsel was not required to give evidence in this Court, it is difficult to understand how defence counsel at the trial could overlook seeking a direction on the topic in light of her Honour’s remarks and her suggestion that she give the “context direction in the bench book”. This was obviously a reference to a direction contained in the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book that is now widely available to members of the profession and the public generally. 
     
      
    31 It is perhaps significant to identify what her Honour would have said had she given the relevant direction from the Bench Book that she initially proposed. The Bench Book contains the following suggested direction on context evidence: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It is important that I explain to you the relevance of this evidence of other acts. It was admitted [ 
        if appropriate: 
         solely] for the purpose of placing the complainant’s evidence of the particular acts relied upon by the Crown to prove the charges in the indictment into what the Crown says is a realistic context.  
         
         
        [Recite the Crown’s submission of the issue(s) in the trial which justified the reception of context evidence.]  
         
         
        Otherwise, you may wonder about the likelihood of apparently isolated acts occurring suddenly without any apparent reason. If a complainant gave evidence of isolated acts of sexual misconduct, you would be entitled to think it was very odd for there to be such isolated acts between these persons. If you had not heard about the evidence that I am talking about now, you may have thought the complainant’s evidence was less credible.  
         
         
        [The following should be adapted to the circumstances of the case:]  
         
         
        If, however, the particular acts charged are placed in a wider context, that is a context of an ongoing history, then that curious feature would disappear. It is for that reason that the law permits a wider sexual history to be provided. It is to avoid artificiality or unreality in the presentation of the evidence. For one or two incidents to be artificially isolated and selected and for a witness to be confined to them could make it very difficult for [ 
        him/her 
        ] to proceed intelligently with [ 
        his/her 
        ] evidence. To pick out, for example, two incidents separated by lengthy periods could leave you with a very strange and unrealistic account.  
         
         
        Therefore, it is open to the Crown to lead evidence of other acts of a sexual nature between the accused and [ 
        the complainant 
        ] … [ 
        explain by reference to the facts of the case 
        ].  
         
         
        However, I must give you some important warnings with regard to this evidence of other acts [ 
        optional: which we can conveniently refer to as “context evidence” 
        ].  
         
         
        You must not use this evidence of other acts as establishing a tendency on the part of the accused to commit offences of the type charged.  
         
         
        You must not substitute the evidence of the other acts for the evidence of the specific offences on the indictment. 
         
         
        You must not reason that, because the accused may have done something wrong to [ 
        the complainant 
        ] on another occasion, [ 
        he/she 
        ] must have done so on the occasions on the indictment.  
        
       
      
    32 Had her Honour followed this direction she would have explained the relevance of the complainant’s allegation that similar acts occurred on other occasions when her mother went out and given the warnings set out including a warning against tendency reasoning, the first of the warnings set out in the suggested direction. As it was, the only part of the direction she gave was the second of the warnings, against substitution of evidence. 
     
      
    33 The submissions on behalf of the appellant in support of this ground of appeal note that no consideration was given at the trial to the evidence of “uncharged acts” arising from the complainant’s evidence, either as to its admissibility or what direction should be given about it until the trial advocate raised the matter after the jury had retired to consider its verdict. Reference was made to the Court’s decision in Qualtieri v R [2006] NSWCCA 95; 171 A Crim R 463 and in particular what was said by McClellan CJ at CL at [80] as to the importance of determining the basis of such evidence and whether it should be admitted in advance of the evidence being given. See also DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272. 
     
      
    34 It is clear in the present case that the evidence was considered to be context evidence, that is as indicating to the jury that the particular complaints that formed the charges in the indictment were not said by the complainant to be isolated incidents of indecent or sexual acts committed by the appellant. There is not the slightest suggestion in the addresses of either counsel that it was to be treated by the jury as other than part of the complainant’s allegations of misconduct by the appellant toward her. This was no doubt because the evidence was so vague, not only as to when it occurred but as to its nature. As has been noted, there was more particularity in the complaints made to the aunt but these were dealt with in the way that I have indicated. 
     
      
    35 The argument of the accused is that, in any case where there is evidence of sexual misconduct falling outside the scope of the charges in the indictment, a full direction should be given explaining the nature of the evidence and warning the jury against tendency reasoning. It was submitted that such a direction must be given as a matter of law and the failure of defence counsel to seek such a direction does not permit the Court to apply rule 4. These submissions should in my view be rejected. 
     
      
    36 A similar situation as that which occurred in this trial was considered by this Court in Rodden v R [2008] NSWCCA 53; 182 A Crim R 227. The applicant, the defacto partner of the child’s mother, was charged with four counts of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child and one count of aggravated indecent assault with a child. During the trial an interview was played to the jury during which the complainant gave evidence of uncharged acts. The complainant said this: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q410 Well, you’ve told me about this one time that you remember happening. How many times do you think this has happened over the time that you (sic) know Matthew, you’ve known Matthew? 
         
        A Mmm. Millions. 
         
        
       
      Later in the interview she was asked: 
       
        
         
        Q631 Okay. And how many times do you think this, this has happened where you’ve watched a movie and that your Dad has come in? 
         
        A Hundreds 
         
         
        Q632 Okay. And when he’s come in, you said that he’s touched you while you’re under the blankets.  
         
        A Yeah. 
        
       
      
    37 There was also in that case evidence of a telephone call between the appellant and the child that could have been used to prove a tendency in the applicant to have a sexual interest in the child. 
     
      
    38 The trial judge gave the following direction in respect of the evidence of the complainant set out above: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Now, you’ve heard pieces of evidence, particularly - well I think, entirely from [the complainant], that she says events such as the particular counts relate to, happened on many occasions. Now you heard that because it’s part of the overall picture of which she speaks, to put the overall situation in context. You are not allowed to use that in any way to fill any gap that you may find in respect of any particular charge. You are not entitled to say, ‘well, we’re not altogether sure about that, because it was going on pretty regularly, so it doesn’t matter’. You are not entitled to do that at all. Each of the charges has been put in a particular way, as I will come to, and you have to be satisfied about the relevant elements in respect of each of them. You cannot use general allegations to fill in gaps in specific charges. 
        
       
       
      No objection was taken to this direction at the trial and no further direction was sought on this topic. 
       
      
    39 There was no ground of appeal filed that raised any complaint about this direction. However, the Court, having raised the issue during the hearing of the appeal, permitted the appellant to file amended grounds of appeal raising a complaint about the adequacy of this direction and the parties filed written submissions. 
     
      
    40 In his judgment, with which the other members of the Court agreed, Hall J stated at [102]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The nature of the relationship evidence as given by the complainant was, if the complainant was accepted as a reliable and truthful witness, extremely prejudicial to the appellant. In those circumstances, it was essential that proper directions be given to the jury as to how such evidence could be used and how it could not be used. 
        
       
       
      His Honour held [at 107] that the directions on relationship evidence given “were inadequate and did not convey the limitations upon its use”. 
       
      
    41 Hall J ultimately concluded that the trial had not been conducted according to law. 
     
      
    42 On the face of it the decision might be taken to support the submission made on behalf of the appellant although neither party referred the Court to the decision. With respect to those that might have a different view, I cannot agree with the passage of Hall J’s judgment in paragraph [102] if it refers only to the fact that the complainant said that the conduct occurred millions or hundreds of times. I cannot accept that such a vague, generalised and clearly exaggerated reference to other misconduct could suggest to a jury by itself that they might indulge in tendency reasoning such that the failure to give a warning against the use of that type of reasoning could result in a miscarriage of justice. If the evidence of the complainant stood alone, then I can see nothing wrong with the direction given by the trial judge. The absence of complaint would have given rise to the application of r 4 and for my part I would have been far from satisfied that a miscarriage of justice had occurred. However there were two aspects of the trial in Rodden that, with respect, clearly indicated that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred. 
     
      
    43 First, there was specific evidence before the jury that could have been used to prove a tendency on the part of the appellant to have a sexual interest in the child. The Court held that the trial judge failed to give adequate directions to the jury on the use to be made of this evidence. 
     
      
    44 In a case where the issue of tendency is raised for the jury’s consideration by reason of some evidence that is placed before the jury for the purposes of proving a propensity on the part of the accused to commit sexual acts against the complainant, the failure to give a tendency warning in respect of other evidence not being used for a tendency purpose could amount to a serious defect in the summing up. The jury, having been alerted to the concept of tendency reasoning, should be directed as to when such reasoning was available and when it was not. The distinction should be drawn between evidence admitted to prove a propensity and evidence not admitted for that purpose. The jury should be directed in clear terms that, if they reject the tendency reasoning arising from the specific evidence, they could not use that reasoning in relation to other evidence that was not admitted for that purpose. 
     
      
    45 Further it was a relevant fact in Rodden that the Crown in addressing the jury referred to the evidence of the other acts of misconduct arising from the complainant’s allegations that it happened “millions” of times and told the jury that this was evidence that the accused had been “conditioning” the child from an age when she was unable to understand the nature of the misconduct: see at [119] of the judgment. The Crown was referring to this evidence, not just to give context to the specific complaints of the child, but in terms that could be taken by the jury to indicate that it was a part of a course of conduct designed to make it easier for the appellant to commit the specific offences set out in the indictment because the child would be compliant and fail to complain. In effect this was tendency reasoning. This was a matter that the Court took into account in determining whether the direction given to the jury was adequate. 
     
      
    46 The Court in Rodden recognised that the risk of miscarriage arising from the failure to give the warning had to be real and not fanciful and that it was not sufficient that the warning or direction should simply have been desirable rather than necessary: see at [120]. The Court concluded in the circumstances of that case that a warning against tendency reasoning was necessary in relation to the general evidence of other acts of misconduct. 
     
      
    47 In my opinion Rodden is not authority for the proposition that the failure to give a tendency warning where there is any evidence of misconduct falling outside the scope of the charges in the indictment results in a fundamental defect in the trial. I do not believe that the law requires that such a warning must be given whenever the evidence of the complainant suggests that sexual misconduct occurred on more occasions than those contained in the charges in the indictment. It may be desirable to give a direction such as that recommended in the Bench Book and set out above, but it is not mandatory in every case, regardless of how vague and general the evidence of other acts might be. 
     
      
    48 Of course if there is anything said in the trial that might suggest a tendency on the part of the accused or the evidence is used in a way that might indicate a tendency, then a warning should be given. But if there is nothing in the evidence or its use by the Crown to indicate the real possibility of tendency reasoning on the part of the jury, then I do not believe that the Court is prevented from applying r 4 where there was a failure to request the warning. I am not convinced that in such a case a failure to give the warning results in a fundamental defect in the trial. 
     
      
    49 In other words, in my opinion each case should be considered on its own facts and an assessment of whether a tendency warning was required as a matter of law in the particular circumstances of the case will depend upon whether there was a significant risk that the jury might have embarked on impermissible tendency reasoning having regard to the evidence placed before it and the arguments of counsel. I accept that one of the considerations in determining whether such a direction is warranted is that the complainant’s evidence is unsupported by other evidence but I do not believe that this fact can be decisive. 
     
      
    50 In the present case the trial advocate said this in her final address in relation to the evidence of other misconduct: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Members of the jury the Crown says that you would be satisfied that the accused had sexual intercourse with [the complainant] in respect of the three counts on the indictment. Remember members of the jury he is not charged with having sexual intercourse with [the complainant] every week for two years and you might think in relation to that evidence of [the complainant] when she told the police it was every time that that was the unintentional exaggeration of a nine year old who simply said that because it felt like every time her mother went out. She told you in evidence towards the end of her evidence that it was more than the three times she described in her interview and she told police that it was more times than the three times she described in her interview. 
         
        
       
      
    51 Defence counsel used the allegation that sexual acts had occurred every time her mother went out in criticism of the credibility of the complainant. He asked the jury not to find it was an “unintentional exaggeration” having regard to the number of times that she had made that or a similar allegation. He pointed to evidence in the trial to submit that such an allegation could not have been true. 
     
      
    52 The evidence that had the most potential to give rise to tendency reasoning was the complaints made to the aunt, simply because they were more specific as to the nature of the sexual conduct on the other occasions. But the jury were told they could not use what the complainant had said as evidence of the truth. Therefore, as counsel for the appellant accepted, that evidence could not have supported tendency reasoning. That evidence was seen at the trial as being relevant only to the credibility of the complainant. 
     
      
    53 It may have been preferable for her Honour to have given the recommended direction in the Bench Book as she proposed to do. At least no argument could then have been raised about the sufficiency of the directions. Counsel for the prosecution should not have been so cavalier in relation to the evidence of other acts in light of the care that this Court has insisted should be given to the admission of that evidence. But neither party saw the evidence as having any value other than going generally to the credit of the complainant and defence counsel used it to the appellant’s advantage. 
     
      
    54 In the circumstances of this particular case the direction given by the judge was sufficient to address the real issues between the parties and there was in my view no real prospect of the jury misusing the evidence by embarking upon tendency reasoning. I am not persuaded that, in the absence of any request by defence counsel at the trial for any further direction, a miscarriage of justice has occurred. The ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 2 Unreasonable verdict 
        
       
      
    55 It is unnecessary to set out the approach upon which this Court determines such a ground of appeal. In essence the Court is required to consider all the evidence at the trial and determine whether the jury should have had a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused notwithstanding its advantage in having seen the complainant give evidence: see the discussion in TK v R [2009] NSWCCA 151. 
     
      
    56 It must be said that this ground was argued somewhat faintly during oral argument. However, in written submissions the appellant relied upon the fact that the complainant had admitted telling lies during the course of her evidence and that there were “major inconsistencies between the version given to police and other witnesses”. 
     
      
    57 As to the issue of the complainant admitting to having told lies, I have already referred to the fact that the complainant said to the Crown that the misconduct had occurred on only three occasions yet she agreed that she had told the police the truth. When in cross-examination it was pointed out to her that her evidence was contradictory as she had told the police that it had happened on more than three occasions, the complainant stated that what she had said to the police was true and what she had said in evidence was untrue. She explained this conduct on the basis that she was embarrassed and she became emotionally upset. When the cross-examiner returned to this topic, the complainant said that she feared having to go to court on another occasion to deal with the other allegations. 
     
      
    58 In my opinion it was well open to the jury to determine that the contradictory evidence and her explanation for it did not affect her general credit and the reliability of the particular complaints that gave rise to the charges in the indictment. They were in a far more advantageous position than this Court to evaluate the significance of that evidence in having seen her demeanour during this part of her testimony. 
     
      
    59 I appreciate that in many cases demeanour can be an unsafe guide to reliability or at least a tribunal of fact can give too much weight to demeanour. But in this case the jury had seen her demeanour at the time she made the interviews with the police and it would have been obvious from what is apparent in the transcript that she was reticent in telling the interviewer what she alleged the appellant had done to her. It will be recalled that the interviewer offered her the opportunity to write down her complaint because she was having difficulty in verbally answering questions. She was a teenager at the trial trying to tell a jury what happened to her at the age of 8 and became distressed at having to give evidence. Clearly the jury were willing to excuse her dishonesty about a matter that did not go to the heart of the charges because they understood why she had said what she did. I would take the same view even without having seen her giving the relevant evidence. 
     
      
    60 Similarly the jury would have understood why there was a discrepancy between what she told police and what she told her aunt. It would not be difficult for a jury to accept that a 10 year old child, who was reticent with the police over revelations that clearly embarrassed her, would be more forthcoming with her aunt. 
     
      
    61 The appellant also submitted that the medical evidence was not neutral, as it was categorised during the trial, but was inconsistent with the complainant’s allegation as to the frequency of the conduct. In my opinion it was open to the jury to accept the prosecution argument that this was a case of “innocent exaggeration” by the complainant who was merely indicating that sexual misconduct of some form or other happened frequently when her mother was not at home. The jury could well determine that the complainant was not to be taken literally and certainly not to the extent of suggesting that on every occasion she was left alone with the appellant he indulged in penile penetration of her. 
     
      
    62 It was also argued that the complainant’s evidence was unreliable because it was apparent that she could not recall the specific incidents upon which the prosecution case was based at the time of the trial. Reliance was placed upon the number of times that the complainant had answered questions asked in cross-examination with “I don’t know” or “I don’t remember”. However, the question for the jury was principally whether her account given to the police seven years earlier was reliable. A relevant matter was the effect of cross-examination upon her, but it did not follow that the jury should have rejected her initial complaint made years earlier. 
     
      
    63 The appellant submits that the Crown case contained such discrepancies and was so inadequate that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied of the complainant’s evidence beyond reasonable doubt. I do not agree. 
     
      
    64 Having considered the whole of the evidence, but taking into account that unlike the jury I have not seen the complainant give evidence, I am unpersuaded that the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable or that there is a significant possibility that an innocent man has been convicted. This ground should be rejected. 
     
      
    65 The appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    66 HISLOP J: I agree with Howie J.

    2 BUDDIN J: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    3 HALL J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by Graham ADCJ in the District Court on 8 August 2008. The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to two counts of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm contrary to s.54A(4) of the Crimes Act 1900. Both offences arise from an incident on 5 September 2006. 
     
      
    4 The offence carries a prescribed maximum penalty of imprisonment for 11 years. After allowing a 25% discount for the applicant’s early plea, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a total term of three years and six months, comprised of a non-parole period of two years and a balance of term of 18 months. That ratio of the total effective non-parole period to total effective parole period was 57%. The individual sentences were:- 
     
      
       
      (1) On the charge relating to Andrew Coppin, a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 8 August 2008 to expire on 7 February 2010 with a balance of term of 18 months to expire on 7 August 2011.  
       
       
      (2) On the charge relating to Alan Brennan, a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 8 February 2009 to expire on 7 August 2010 with a balance of term of 18 months to expire on 7 February 2012.  
       
      
    5 Additional matters of drive unregistered and drive uninsured were taken into account on a Form 1 in relation to Andrew Coppin. Charges concerning such matters attract maximum penalties by way of a fine only. 
     
      
    6 An agreed statement of facts had been put before the court. On 5 September 2006, the applicant had been drinking at the Brew House Hotel, Blacktown with two friends who were the two victims in these proceedings, Andrew Coppin and Alan Brennan. At about 2.30 pm, the applicant and his two friends got into the applicant’s vehicle, an unregistered custom built hot rod, with the applicant driving. The applicant was travelling at a speed of 60 kilometres per hour in a 50 kilometre per hour zone. The applicant lost control of the vehicle and mounted the curb. The vehicle continued to roll a number of times with all occupants of the vehicle ejected as no seat belts were fitted. The vehicle collided with a tree, a steel power pole and then a front boundary fence of a house. 
     
      
    7 The occupants were admitted to Westmead hospital with serious injuries. The applicant’s blood alcohol content was 0.162 g/100 ML. The applicant suffered serious leg and vertebrae fractures. 
     
      
    8 In the written submissions for the applicant, reference was made to the submissions on sentence concerning the applicant’s injuries and physical ailments. Those submissions referred to a range of medical problems afflicting the applicant. The submissions were expressed in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… The glass eye, the hearing aids, the body brace, the walking stick, the hip replacement. You’ve heard that when he needs to clean his feet or bend down he has to get his wife to help him to reach those extremities of his body. So clearly we have a man who, because of his large number of problems, will find life in gaol very difficult. He’ll find it difficult because he won’t have anyone to help him. He will find it difficult because he can’t defend himself if he needs to. He will find it difficult because he can’t, if he’s having a shower, he doesn’t have his hearing aids in, he can’t hear anyone approaching him, if he’s got his glass eye out he’s only got the vision of his left eye. 
        
       
       
        
        And that would mean that, it’s not only harder in gaol but it’s much more dangerous for Mr Brooks in gaol, so in my submission your Honour could mitigate the sentence because of the very difficult time that Mr Brooks is going to experience in gaol.” 
         (Transcript, 25 July 2008 at pp.27.3 to 27.20) 
        
       
       
      The ground of appeal 
       
      
    9 The single ground of appeal relied upon by the applicant is that his Honour failed to take into account the extra curial punishment suffered by the applicant as a matter in mitigation.  
     
      
    10 At the sentencing hearing, the applicant presented medical evidence concerning his injuries in the form of a report from Dr S P Ng. The applicant also gave oral evidence as to the difficulties he had been experiencing as a result of his injuries. The Crown does not contest that the applicant suffered a number of injuries as a result of his conduct. 
     
      
    11 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge did not take into account the extra curial punishment suffered by the applicant, and that patent error has been established. Mr Dennis of counsel for the applicant recognised that the sentencing judge did make some allowance for the injuries sustained by way of special circumstances, in particular, for the hardship that the applicant would experience in custody. However, it was submitted that the sentencing judge did not categorise the applicant’s injuries which arose from the commission of the offences as “extra curial punishment” and, therefore, failed to take them into account in mitigation. 
     
      
    12 The Crown, on the other hand, submitted that his Honour did have regard to the injuries suffered by the applicant in the course of committing the offences.  
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence – references to the applicant’s ill health 
       
      
    13 At pages 7 to 8 of his Remarks on Sentence, the sentencing judge referred to the applicant’s injuries, including the fact that as a result of lumbar fractures, he continued to suffer from persistent back pain and was required to wear a back brace for support. The evidence indicates he already had chronic lower back pain due to an L5/S1 disc protrusion apparently related to a work injury in 1996.  
     
      
    14 In the Remarks on Sentence (at p.8), his Honour stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “His treating general practitioner reported that he sustained a closed head injury, L1 and L2 wedge fracture and a laceration of the left arm. The lumbar fractures were managed conservatively with a back brace, the wound on his left arm recovered with no complications and there were no further problems with the head injury. He was an in-patient at Westmead for 17 days. He continued to suffer from persistent back pain and continued to wear the back brace for support. He was still complaining of the back pain twelve months after the incident and complained of difficulty with prolonged sitting and standing a difficulty in getting around. He was referred to an orthopaedic surgeon for further opinion, but treatment remained conservative. The GP indicates that there are no active treatments for crush fractures.” 
        
       
      
    15 Later in the Remarks on Sentence (at p.17), his Honour stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “By way of reminder of what happened on this occasion, he continues to wear a back brace as a result of the injuries which he sustained in this collision.” 
        
       
      
    16 Finally, at p.20 of his Remarks on Sentence, his Honour referred to the back pain which the applicant continued to suffered from due to the crash incident on 5 September 2006. 
     
      
    17 I note at this point that no criticism has been made as to the accuracy or adequacy of the sentencing judge’s references to the nature of the injuries and disabilities resulting from the offence. 
     
      
    18 His Honour referred to the view of the applicant’s general practitioner that he would have “difficulty coping in a gaol environment should he be sentenced to full time custody. He had difficulty with lifting, bending, trunk twisting, prolonged sitting, or standing” (at p.8 of Remarks on Sentence). His Honour further commented on the applicant’s health in relation to sentence at page 17 of his remarks on sentence as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        It is submitted that his own poor health (he has a range of major health problems and had some difficulty even in washing his feet) would mean that life in gaol would be very difficult for him. He would not be able to obtain the assistance which he needs in washing. He would also be limited in his capacity to defend himself in custody and his hearing loss means that he would not be able to hear anything while he was in the showers because he would have to remove his hearing aid during that time. 
        
       
       
        
        Clearly, there are a number of considerations which would sound, at least, by way of special circumstances, particularly his state of health … 
        ” 
        
       
      
    19 The sentencing judge proceeded to structure the sentences to reflect the special circumstances in the case, in particular, the circumstances of the health of the applicant and the additional hardship of any term of imprisonment (at p.20 of Remarks on Sentence).  
     
      
    20 Whilst the phrase “extra curial punishment” was not employed as a relevant factor in assessing an appropriate sentence, the Crown contended that his Honour did take the applicant’s injuries into account in a manner that adequately reflected the fact that the applicant suffered, and continues to suffer, the physical consequences of his offending.  
     
      
       
      The relevant principles 
       
      
    21 While it is the function of the courts to punish those who have committed crimes, a sentencing court, in determining what sentence it should impose, can properly take into account that the offender has already suffered some serious loss or detriment as a result of having committed the offence: Regina v Daetz; Regina v Wilson (2003) 139 A Crim R 398 at 411; cf Regina v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 and Regina v Clampitt-Wotten (2002) 37 MVR 340.  
     
      
    22 While the health of the offender is relevant to the type and length of sentence imposed, generally speaking it will only be a mitigating factor when there is evidence to show that there is a serious risk that imprisonment will be a greater burden on an offender, by reason of ill health, or where there is a serious risk that imprisonment will have a grave adverse effect on the offender’s health: Regina v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 589, cf Regina v Badanjak [2004] NSWCCA 395, Regina v Burrell (2004) 114 A Crim R 207 and Regina v Azar [2000] NSWCCA 26. 
     
      
    23 This is because the court is required to take into account all material facts and is required to ensure the punishment the offender receives is appropriate and not excessive. How much weight a sentencing judge should give extra-curial punishment depends, of course, on all the circumstances of the case: Regina v Daetz; Regina v Wilson (supra) at 411. 
     
      
    24 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the decision in Whybrow v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 270 has similar features to the present case. The applicant in that case also drove a vehicle while intoxicated, causing death and serious injury to three other road users. He sustained serious injuries in the collision. Although the sentencing judge referred to his injuries, the Court of Criminal Appeal inferred that he did not take the matter into account in sentencing the applicant. In the present case, the sentencing judge, as I have previously stated, specifically noted that the applicant’s injuries were taken into account by way of special circumstances. This is not a case where the sentencing judge failed to mitigate the sentence at all by reason of the applicant’s ill health.  
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    25 There was a need for the sentencing judge to ensure that, in the evaluation of all relevant matters and in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, the sentence to be imposed was one that adequately reflected both the objective gravity of the offences and the applicant’s culpability in relation to them.  
     
      
    26 The sentencing judge referred to a connection between the applicant’s problem with alcohol and his criminal history and observed that aspects of retribution remained as strong in the case of a person who has demonstrated over many years:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… a defiance of the law, particularly in relation to drink driving and driving whilst disqualified … There remains some need for individual deterrence. It cannot be overlooked that, in the past, the offender has been sentenced to terms of imprisonment as well as other less stringent orders, as a result of driving either while disqualified and/or driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol. Those sentences, in the past, did not seem to act as any significant deterrent.”  
        (Remarks on Sentence, p.18) 
        
       
      
    27 In sentencing the applicant, the sentencing judge properly took into account the applicant’s extensive history of driving offences. In the period 24 February 1974 to 10 May 2004, he was convicted of the offence of drive manner dangerous (two separate offences), the offence of negligent driving (three separate offences), the offence of dangerous driving, several offences of drive motor vehicle with a higher than prescribed concentration of alcohol, and on 16 June 1988, an offence of culpable driving occasioning grievous bodily harm for which he was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of two years and six months with a non-parole period of 18 months.28 In exercising the sentencing discretion, his Honour was entitled to give appropriate weight to the objective criminality of the offence and to ensure that the sentences imposed reflected the seriousness of the offences. The degree of accumulation in this case (six months) was not excessive.  
     
      
    29 The applicant’s history of repeated offending associated with driving motor vehicles plainly indicated a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. It is apparent that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was an appropriate one, having regard to the matters to which I have referred, including in particular, the applicant's past criminal history. 
     
      
    30 It is, in my opinion, plain beyond argument that his Honour specifically had full regard to the applicant’s ongoing disabilities, including, in particular, his continuing back pain. In respect of his disabilities, his Honour observed “… He is, in that sense, deserving of some consideration by way of leniency and much of that consideration has flowed into the finding of special circumstances …” (Remarks on Sentence, p.20). 
     
      
    31 An examination of the transcript of the proceedings on sentence on 25 July 2008 indicates that counsel then appearing for the applicant did not in fact refer in the course of submissions to the concept of ""extra-curial punishment"". 
     
      
    32 The fact that the sentencing judge did not in terms refer to “extra curial punishment” does not indicate that his Honour failed to appropriately and sufficiently mitigate the sentences. His Honour took into account the effect and extent to which the applicant’s injuries sustained during the offence would have upon his health, and his experience generally, in gaol. It was upon that basis that his Honour found special circumstances such as to warrant a measure of leniency. His Honour may not have used the phrase “extra-curial punishment”, however, it cannot be said that he failed to take the matters which this phrase entails into account when sentencing the applicant.  
     
      
    33 I am of the opinion that the ground of appeal relied upon is without substance and that the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    34 Accordingly, I propose the following orders:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (2) Appeal dismissed.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Jeffrey John Mason appears for sentence today, having pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a most serious offence. That is an offence of aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence. The serious indictable offence he committed was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon a person by the name of Mervyn Hamill. The circumstance of aggravation relied on by the Crown in the charge is that the offender maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm upon Mr Hamill, but the Crown could have relied on other aggravating features of Mr Mason’s conduct, a matter I will return to when considering the appropriateness of the standard non-parole period for the present offence.2 Mr Mason pleaded guilty in the Local Court, as I have mentioned, to this offence and so the sentence I will ultimately impose is reduced by 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty.3 Mr Mason and Mr Hamill were neighbours. They got on reasonably well, sharing meals occasionally, but there was a problem with Mr Mason’s mental state. He had been receiving treatment from a community based crisis team for some time because of problems he was having, in particular, paranoid schizophrenia. He was on antipsychotic medication for a while, which controlled his aggressive behaviour. However, Mr Mason told the crisis team lies. He told them that he was doing well and not experiencing fits of rage, when these in fact were not true. The crisis team, no doubt due to scarce resources, accepted what Mr Mason said, and so his regular injections stopped. This led to a further deterioration of his behaviour, culminating in the attack on Mr Hamill on 1 January this year.4 Early that morning, Mr Hamill was in bed. The offender knocked on his door but was told to go away. A short time later he cut through the wire of the screen door, which allowed him access to the other door. He entered the flat, armed with a metal pole. Mr Hamill was asleep in bed. He was thus vulnerable to Mr Mason’s attack. Mr Mason hit him a number of times to his head and body, causing serious injuries to him. Those injuries are graphically depicted in photographs tendered this morning. A significant wound is apparent to Mr Hamill’s right wrist, right elbow and right upper arm. Other bruising, consistent with the use of a metal pole, can be seen on Mr Hamill’s arm. There is also a deep wound to Mr Hamill’s head.5 After the offender left, he threw the pole away. Police were called a few hours later, by ambulance officers who had attended the scene.6 Mr Hamill was taken to John Hunter Hospital. A doctor there noted the lacerations that I have mentioned. He identified tendons visible through the laceration, such was the severity of them. Although Dr Loton told Mr Hamill that these injuries required surgical repair, Mr Hamill refused treatment and checked himself out.7 I record that Mr Hamill has since died from an unrelated illness. It is important to emphasise that Mr Hamill’s unfortunate death has nothing to do with the attack upon him by Mr Mason.8 After police had been called by the ambulance officers, they went to the offender’s unit. He was asked about what occurred and he immediately admitted assaulting Mr Hamill with the metal pipe. He was asked, “Mate, can you tell me anything about the assault on Merv,” to which the offender replied, “Wait a sec,” and he then appeared to think for a while.  
     
      
       “He has been niggling at me for the past few weeks. He has been trying to touch me up. I had enough and I was sick of it, so I hit him with the pole.” 
      
    9 The offender showed police where the pole was. It was seized and the offender was placed in custody.10 Later on, the offender spoke to Dr Westmore, a psychiatrist who interviewed him and who prepared a report for the benefit of the court. The offender expanded on why it was that he hit Mr Hamill repeatedly. It is clear that the prime factor causing the offender to act the way he did, that is, to viciously assault Mr Hamill, was the offender’s mental illness.11 The offender has had a lengthy history of mental illness. Dr Westmore was able to see hospital notes covering the period 2002 to 2007. He commented that he was unable to find hospital notes for 2008, but of course, that is explained by the fact that the offender was not being treated by the crisis team because he had told them lies which suggested that he did not need their assistance any more.12 Dr Westmore concludes that the offender has a relapsing chronic mental illness. His illness is characterised by paranoid thoughts, auditory hallucinations, depression and self-harming behaviours.13 Part of Mr Mason’s problem is that, on top of his mental illness, he takes, or has in the past, taken illegal drugs. One of the matters which would improve Mr Mason’s future and reduce the risk of him further offending involves the offender rehabilitating himself from his use of drugs. It is in the community’s interest that Mr Mason get off the drugs that he has been on, because that will significantly reduce the risk of his mental illness relapsing such that he commits a further offence of violence such as this.14 For that reason, I will find special circumstances in this case. There will be an extended period of eligibility for parole at the expense of the non-parole period.15 The offender has a criminal history but, in the light of the offence that he committed on 1 January this year, it is notable that he has no convictions for violence in the past. In fact, his criminal history is relatively light, consisting merely of driving offences and one offence of break enter and steal for which he received initially a sentence of periodic detention for three months, although that was later cancelled. 16 There are a couple of other minor offences, for example, failing to produce evidence of entitlement to a concession card, but it is remarkable that, at thirty-four years of age, with a history of mental illness, the offender’s criminal history has not involved in the past any other offences of violence.17 This does tend to suggest that if the offender complies with his medication and treatment regime prescribed for him, it is likely that he will not commit further offences of violence in the future.18 It is very important, therefore, that the criminal justice system do what it can to ensure the offender’s compliance with treatment and medication prescribed for him.19 It will not be me who is setting the conditions of Mr Mason’s parole, it will be the Parole Board, but it is my strong recommendation to them that the conditions of his parole include matters designed to ensure Mr Mason’s compliance with medication and treatment regimes.20 I mentioned before that this offence has a standard non-parole period. That, of course, is not of direct application, given the plea of guilty, but it remains as a guidepost to the sentence I should impose upon the offender. 21 I find that this offence is significantly higher than the middle of the range for offences of this type. In making that finding, I take into account that the offence occurred in Mr Hamill’s home. That may be a usual circumstance in which offences of this type occur, but it is not invariably the case.22 I take also into account that the actual bodily harm was serious and significant. I take into account that in the list of circumstances of aggravation to be found in section 105A, this circumstance of aggravation relied on by the Crown is more serious than many others, and I take into account that other circumstances of aggravation were present as well. Mr Mason knew that Mr Hamill was home, and he was armed with a weapon.23 For those matters, I make a finding that the objective gravity of the offence was significantly higher than the middle of the range.24 On the other hand, there are factors tending to suggest a sentence which has a lower non-parole period than the standard be imposed. They relate primarily to the offender’s mental state, his plea of guilty, and the need that I mentioned earlier to have a lengthier period of eligibility for parole. That would be the case in the absence of a finding of special circumstances.25 The fact that the offender has the mental illness diagnosed by Dr Westmore and others suggests that it is inappropriate to impose upon the offender a sentence which has within it a substantial component of general deterrence. That is not to say, as Mr Booth concedes, that personal deterrence becomes unimportant. The offender must realise that if he is to break the law in the future in a serious way, then he will go to gaol. 26 He must also realise, as he now does, the connection between lying to the community crisis team and the offence which he committed on Mr Hamill.27 Part of the sentence I will impose upon the offender is designed to bring home to him the need for him to do what is required of him, because if he does not, and if he commits a further crime, then he will go to gaol.28 The offender has been in custody since 10 March 2009 and so it is appropriate that the sentence I impose upon him will commence on that date.29 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years and a head sentence of four years to commence on 10 March 2009. This means that the offender’s non-parole period will expire on 9 March 2011, on which day he is eligible to be released to parole.

   JUDGMENT1. Mark Andrew Hughes was seriously addicted to drugs. He has been a drug addict for all his life. For most of that time he was able to hold down a job and remain out of trouble with the law. However in 2008 his addiction to the drug known as “ice” turned his life into a very seriously wrong direction. 2. First, he was not able to maintain a job which he had held for some thirteen or fourteen years. Then his daily habit, he found, was costing him over $400. 3. In order to provide himself with the funds to support that daily habit he embarked on a rampage of crime from about the middle of September to November 2008. He broke into businesses, warehouses, workshops and private homes. He ransacked some of those places. He destroyed property in some of those places. He stole thousands of dollars worth of belongings from most of those places. In one instance, the most serious, he bailed up a householder who, unfortunately, came home when he was in the process of ransacking the house.4. The Court of Criminal Appeal in this State has made its views clear about the approach which judges have to take to sentencing offenders such as Mr Hughes who have committed these crimes. In Maher [2004] NSWCCA 177 at [44] the Court said that judges need to “send a very clear message to others who may be minded to conduct themselves in a similar fashion that if they come before the courts they will be punished severely”. In Scott [1999] NSWCCA 434 the court said at [17] that the incidence of break, enter and steal throughout New South Wales was a “cause for grave disquiet”. It added that “the community are understandably angry and frustrated at the seeming immunity enjoyed by the burglar.” It further observed that it is “a notorious fact that householders face huge premiums, as well as the vast expense of making their homes secure”. The Court of Criminal Appeal in that case said that the “community has the rightful expectation that judicial officers will act responsibly and impose meaningful penalties on the rare occasion when the burglar is apprehended and convicted. Other would-be burglars just might be deterred when it is learnt that the crime of break, enter and steal is regarded as being grossly serious and will attract serious punishment.”5. Mr Hughes’ rampage of break enter and steal offences has resulted in him facing six charges, most of them for that offence. In addition, in sentencing him on two of those charges I am asked to take into account other offences which are on a list of additional charges under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.6. The six charges in the order in which he committed them are break and enter and steal committed between 1 and 4 October 2008. That is an offence against the law of this State contained in s 112(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum of fourteen years. There was a further offence of breaking, entering and stealing committed between 5 and 8 October 2008. In sentencing him for that offence I take into account one offence of stealing a car which is on a Form 1 under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Between 25 and 27 October 2008 he committed the third offence, which was a further break enter and steal; and between 2 and 3 November 2008 he committed the fourth offence, which was also a break enter and steal. On the same occasion he committed the fifth offence of destroying property. The offence of damaging property is a crime under s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum of five years’ imprisonment.7. The most serious offence is the most recent, committed on 11 November 2008. That is an offence of aggravated break and enter and steal. When sentencing him for that offence I must take into account no fewer than thirteen offences on a Form 1. The maximum for the aggravated break, enter and steal is twenty years’ imprisonment. In addition Parliament regards that offence as so serious that it has fixed a standard non-parole period of five years to that crime.8. It is important when judges sentence offenders for the judge to record briefly the circumstances of each offence so that there is a public understanding of just how serious each offence was. 9 Between 1 and 4 October 2008 Mr Hughes broke into a RailCorp substation at Emu Plains and helped himself to copper cable worth some $2000.10. Between 5 and 8 October 2008 Mr Hughes jemmied open the screen door in a Castle Hill home. He set about destroying various alarms in the home and ransacked the house. He stole a television, an amplifier and speakers and a remote control, Playstations, a set top box, five compact disc players and their remotes, personal papers, an acoustic guitar, a laptop computer, costume jewellery, an iPod, a Walkman and a safe. He broke into a car that was at the house. When police arrived they found clothing and personal items all over the floor and items of furniture out of place. The alarm had been smashed with a hammer, which was nearby. I take into account, in sentencing him for that offence, an offence of stealing a car which is set out, as I said, in a Form 1 which has been signed on behalf of the prosecutor and signed by Mr Hughes and I now sign that document as well. The car which he stole was a very expensive car, valued at about $140,000 when it was bought and insured for some $83,000. He stole about $15,000 worth of goods and it can be readily appreciated from the list of items which he stole what an impact it must have had on the owner or occupants of the house to find their personal belongings and personal records lost when they got home.11. The third matter I am sentencing him for occurred between 25 and 27 October 2008, when he used a crowbar to get into premises occupied by Safe Access Scaffolding at St Marys. He forced a locked door and stole a laptop computer and mobile phones, as well as lots of tools. The value of the property he stole was some $20,000. Once again, one can imagine the inconvenience and distress which the theft of computers and mobile phones must have had on the managers of that business.12. Between 2 and 3 November 2008 he forced entry into the office of Jay & Lel Excavations at Glendenning. He cut a hole in one of the walls of the building. He ransacked the office. He caused damage to the walls within a demountable office, as well as damaging the office furniture and the office alarm system, the doors and a truck and the locks of a float. He damaged lots of other things and the damage he managed to cause in that ransacking exercise was over $14,500. Not satisfied with that, he took it upon himself to steal things such as cash and a camera. The items he stole amounted to a value of over $6000. The business submitted what was called a “Vandalism Report”, which listed the damage to all of the items and fittings at its premises. It makes very sober reading. That activity, as I said, resulted in a charge of destroying and damaging property as well as the break, enter and steal.13. The final offence I am sentencing him for is, as I have said, the most serious and occurred on 11 November 2008, when he took it upon himself to break into a private home at Croydon. The home was occupied by a clergyman and his wife. The clergyman was out on his morning walk and his wife was out shopping. When the clergyman got home he let himself in and saw glass which had been shattered in the lounge room. He was confronted by a man standing in the middle of the lounge. The man was holding in one of his hands what the witness described as looking like some “wire cutters or snips”. The intruder rushed at the clergyman, waving what he had in his hand. The clergyman said that the man “got me in the hallway before entering the lounge room. I remember him holding the snippers in his left hand, because as he came towards me I grabbed his left arm because he was holding the snippers in that hand. I was trying to keep the snippers away from me. I was afraid he was going to hit me with the snippers. We ended up in a struggle. I had hold of his right arm and he was pushing against me.”14. The intruder was yelling at him and making loud noises to scare him. Understandably the clergyman was taken by surprise and must have been terrified. In fact the facts, which are agreed between the parties, record that the clergyman “was convinced that he was to be the subject of a homicide”. The clergyman went on to say that the man “overpowered me and we struggled into the front bedroom. He forced me into the front bedroom that is also known as the computer room. This room is at the front of the house to my right as I walked into the house. The guy forced me into this room and said to me, ‘Lay on the bed and I won’t hit you.’ I did what he asked. He still had his pair of snippers in his hand.”15. The man was concerned that his wife might turn up at any time and so he alerted the intruder in the hope that the intruder would leave. The intruder tied up the clergyman’s hands and put a gag in his mouth. He rummaged around in the house a little further and then left the home.16. Needless to say, this must have been an extraordinarily terrifying experience for the clergyman, whose home was used to commit this crime by Mr Hughes. I should have added that on his way out he helped himself to some cameras and opals and other property worth over $3000, as well as ransacking the home.17. I am asked by the parties to take into account in sentencing Mr Hughes for that offence thirteen offences to which he has pleaded guilty which are listed on a Form 1 which is signed on behalf of the parties and by Mr Hughes and now by me. They are mostly break and enter and steal offences with some other offences concerning property and cars.18. Mr Sandilands, who appeared for Mr Hughes, tendered two exhibits and helpfully called his client to give evidence. One of the exhibits was a Probation and Parole Service pre-sentence report, which had been prepared earlier this year for some Local Court proceedings but which contained very useful information about Mr Hughes’ personal circumstances.19. Mr Hughes’ personal background included being a child in a family where the parents separated when he was very young. His mother formed a relationship with another man, who became Mr Hughes’ stepfather, but that relationship involved alcohol and violence, and resulted as well in eventual separation and divorce. Mr Hughes said his own mother had a problem with abusing prescription medication, as well as some mental health issues.20. Mr Hughes himself married in 1991. That marriage produced three children, one of whom, a little boy, died tragically at the age of seven months. The two surviving children are girls who are now teenagers and with whom there is little or no contact by Mr Hughes or on their part as well. That marriage was dissolved and he remarried in 1996. That marriage produced two sons, who are now aged eight and ten, with whom Mr Hughes communicates by phone from custody every Sunday. That marriage, too, resulted in a divorce in 2005.21. Mr Hughes left school in the middle of his secondary education and has had various unskilled jobs over the years. The longest employment was some thirteen or fourteen years when he was working in a recycling factory.22. He has always had a drug problem. He commenced with cannabis aged twelve, and tried heroin at the age of fifteen. The probation officer reported that he has undertaken some lengthy periods of residential treatment for what became an addiction, but has to date been “unable to successfully manage times of personal crises without resorting to substance abuse in order to escape the reality of his situation”. He went on in more recent years to use drugs such as speed and ice and told the probation officer that, regarding the most recent offences, he was using such large volumes of those drugs that he needed to remain drug-affected so that he would not be affected by the consequences of “coming down”.23. He has minimal contact with his family. I should at this stage make a note of the evidence which Mr Hughes gave when he was called by Mr Sandilands. He acknowledged his personal history and the fact that the accounts he gave to the probation and parole officer and to a psychologist, to whom I will refer shortly, were true and correct. I accept those histories. His family had in effect cut him off although, as I said, he maintained contact with his two younger children, the boys aged eight and ten. He acknowledged that he had hit rock bottom. He acknowledged the shame and remorse he felt for the offences which the probation officer noted as well, and said that he had written to the clergyman apologising for his behaviour. He realises in prison, being aged forty-seven, that he is amongst the older inmates by many years.24. When he is released from prison he hopes to be offered accommodation by a sister-in-law, who has indicated that she would be willing to put him up, and would be keen to undertake counselling in a program which would be offered by the psychologist. He acknowledged that he had stopped counselling before committing these crimes, or perhaps during it, because of the impact of drugs. He acknowledged also that the relationship with his second wife was a very important one to him but that his drug addiction had effectively killed that relationship.25. As I said, Mr Sandilands tendered a report by W John Taylor, a well-known clinical forensic psychologist. Mr Taylor’s report picked up a number of the items which the probation and parole officer had reported on so far as his personal history was concerned. He noted Mr Hughes’ saying, concerning his most recent drug addiction, that he was “so far out of control on drugs I couldn’t stop. Ice and speed. I didn’t have the strength to stop myself.” He noted that he felt ashamed at his behaviour. He noted the lack of significant family support.26. He thought Mr Hughes had a conduct disorder in his early teenage years and was apparently suffering from depression at the moment and clearly had a drug abuse disorder. He thought Mr Hughes had a moderate risk of general recidivism and a low to moderate risk of violence recidivism. This could improve if he persevered with drug rehabilitation and is able to successfully resolve his drug abuse. (I should add at this stage he is on a methadone program in custody at present.) He said Mr Hughes was highly motivated to overcome his drug problem. There needs to be taken into account in assessing his prospects of recidivism the lack of social and emotional support. Mr Taylor referred to a program conducted by himself called the “Ex-Inmate Program”, which would be available to Mr Hughes on release from custody and which would assist him in dealing with his drug addiction.27. Mr Hughes has a prior criminal record, but it is not a significant one for a forty-seven year old man who has had a drug problem for most of his life. Apart from a charge involving some sexual relations as a juvenile with another juvenile and a break and enter when he was a child, he has convictions for false pretences and theft and drug use which were recorded when he was aged twenty-two. Then his record is clear until late last year, when there are convictions for driving offences, goods in custody and larceny. He has obviously, as I said in my opening remarks, managed to lead a law-abiding life despite that life being controlled by his drug addiction to a significant degree.28. To his credit, Mr Hughes pleaded guilty to all of the charges which he faced. To some extent that was inevitable, because he left DNA traces in almost all of the crime scenes that he had attended. Whilst that may be taken into account so far as his remorse is concerned, the impact of his pleading guilty at what Mr Kiru, who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, acknowledges is the earliest opportunity, has a significant impact on the administration of justice in this State. For that reason the sentences which I will shortly impose will be discounted, each of them by twenty-five per cent, to reflect the impact which that plea has had on the process of administering criminal justice in this State.29. I was assisted by both Mr Sandilands and Mr Kiru in their submissions. Mr Sandilands argued that the aggravated break, enter and steal was just below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. He pointed out that the crime is commonly described as a home invasion, but this was not a case where the intruder burst into the home which was already occupied by the owner. He acknowledged the Form 1 offences and their impact. He referred to the guideline judgment issued by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 and submitted that none of the offences was professional and planned, but opportunistic. I accept that submission.30. He acknowledged that his client had obviously committed a multiplicity of offences. He also acknowledged that some of the offences were committed whilst his client was on conditional liberty. Those offences were the offences committed 25 to 27 October 2008: when he broke into Safe Access Scaffolding, he was on bail; the offences committed between 2 and 3 November 2008 at Jay & Lel Excavations in Glendenning when he was on bail; and the offence committed at Croydon on 11 November 2008 when he bailed up the clergyman, when once again he was on bail.31. He correctly observed that his client did not have a significant record. He drew to my attention his client’s genuine remorse and the significance of the early plea of guilty, both of which I take into account.32. He submitted that I may be able to find that his client had good prospects of rehabilitation, although he acknowledged that they must be guarded, given the report by the psychologist and his client’s personal history and the lack of family support. I am not convinced on the balance of probabilities that his client’s prospects are good. I hope for his client’s sake that his client takes the course which Mr Sandilands points out a man in his late forties at the crossroads of his life should take, but his history and lack of family support do not enable me to find on the balance that his prospects are so good that I can take them into account positively. I think that would be unrealistic.33. He argued that there are special circumstances which would warrant me adjusting the ratio between the non-parole period and the additional term of the sentence. It is his client’s first time in custody and there must be a degree of accumulation in the sentences. Mr Kiru acknowledged the force of that submission and I will adjust that ratio.34. Mr Kiru highlighted the significance of the thirteen offences on the Form 1 attached to the aggravated break, enter and steal. He pointed out that most of them are themselves break, enter and steal offences and argued that the aggravated break, enter and steal must be close to the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I took that submission to mean that it was within the range and in the middle of that range.35. I have been helpfully been provided with statistics issued by the JIRS service provided by the New South Wales Judicial Commission. I have taken into account the seriousness of the crimes committed by Mr Hughes and the submissions made by both parties and I have determined that the following sentences should be imposed.36. For offence number 2, 1 to 4 October 2008, break, enter and steal from RailCorp, I would regard an appropriate sentence as a fixed term of twelve months, but I will discount that by twenty-five per cent and impose a fixed term of nine months to commence on 1 December 2008 and expire on 31 August 2009. 37. For the offence numbered 6 of breaking and entering and stealing from the Castle Hill home between 5 and 8 October 2008, taking into account the matter on the Form 1 and the other aspects of that offence which render it more serious such as vandalism, I regard an appropriate sentence as eighteen months, however because Mr Hughes pleaded guilty I propose to discount that sentence. I will discount it for convenience, erring in his favour, by more than twenty-five per cent to twelve months’ imprisonment. That twelve months will commence on 1 March 2009 and expire on 21 February 2010. There will be, it is noted, some accumulation between the first and the second sentences. There will in fact be a cumulation spread over a number of these sentences, because each of them represented a separate crime so far as the victims were concerned.38. Turning to the offence numbered 3 in exhibit A of breaking and entering and stealing from Safe Access Scaffolding at St Marys, that was committed whilst he was on bail and I regard an appropriate sentence as twelve months, but because of his plea of guilty I will discount that by twenty-five per cent to a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment. That will commence on 1 September 2009 and will expire on 31 May 2010.39. The offence numbered 4 in exhibit A is breaking and entering and stealing from Jay & Lel Excavations at Glendenning. That was committed on bail. I regard an appropriate sentence as one of eighteen months’ imprisonment, but erring in Mr Hughes’ favour I discount that by more than twenty-five per cent to twelve months imprisonment because of his plea of guilty. That twelve months will commence on 1 March 2010 and will expire on 28 February 2011.40. For the offence numbered 5 in exhibit A of intentionally destroying or damaging property, also committed at Glendenning, I regard an appropriate sentence as six months, but because of his plea of guilty I will impose a sentence of four months’ imprisonment. That will commence on 1 January 2011 and expire on 30 April 2011.41. Turning to the offence numbered 1 in exhibit A of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, that too was committed whilst Mr Hughes was on bail. I need first, however, to assess where it lies in the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind. For that reason I do not take into account the fact that he was on bail. I regard this as a serious instance of that crime. The nature of the aggravation itself which was pleaded was significant, namely that the victim was deprived of his liberty, although I acknowledge that was for a relatively short time. But in addition the victim was assaulted in the sense of being approached whilst Mr Hughes was armed with an offensive weapon or instrument, namely the pliers, and there was a degree of manhandling involved in the struggle, although no actual bodily harm.42. I regard that offence as falling within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. That would require me, according to s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to set the standard non-parole period as five years as the non-parole period for the offence, but I may set a shorter non-parole period if there are reasons which are contained within s 21A of that Act for setting a lesser period. 43. Mr Sandilands has drawn my attention to the fact that his client pleaded guilty to this offence, and I regard that as an appropriate reason for not fixing the standard non-parole period in this case. Stepping away from consideration of the standard non-parole period, I regard this as a serious crime. It was committed whilst Mr Hughes was on bail and apart from that, in determining the appropriate sentence I need to take into account the fact that he has pleaded guilty to thirteen offences, many of a similar kind, on the Form 1.44. I would regard an appropriate overall sentence for this crime as eight years, however he has pleaded guilty to this charge so I propose to reduce that overall sentence to six years’ imprisonment. I regard the accumulation of the various sentences and the fact that it will be Mr Hughes’ first time in prison as being special circumstances to warrant an adjustment in the ratio between the non-parole period and the parole period. Accordingly I fix a non-parole period of three years, to commence on 1 May 2011 and to expire on 30 April 2014. The balance of the term will be three years, to commence on 1 May 2014 and to expire on 30 April 2017.45. By my calculations the overall sentence which I am imposing on Mr Hughes is eight years and five months, commencing on 1 December 2008 and expiring on 30 April 2017. The non-parole period component of that overall sentence is five years and five months, commencing on 1 December 2008 and expiring on 30 April 2014.HIS HONOUR: Now in a moment I will discharge my statutory obligation to explain the sentence to Mr Hughes, but first are there any factual errors which I have made?KIRU: I’m not sure whether your Honour has convicted the prisoner, because--46. No, thank you. In addition I convict Mr Hughes of each of the six offences which I have earlier described in my remarks on sentence.Any factual errors?KIRU: No, your Honour.SANDILANDS: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Now the mathematics?KIRU: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I think it adds up, and the ratio should be around the mid sixties. It’s not seventy-five per cent, it’s more like sixty-five, sixty-six per cent. I think that’s right, okay. I don’t think the compulsory drug treatment centre is relevant.SANDILANDS: It’s not, your Honour.KIRU: No, your honour.HIS HONOUR: And finally, Mr Kiru, what--KIRU: In relation to the two 166 certificates, your Honour, that’s item 12.HIS HONOUR: There are two of them.KIRU: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: What do I do?KIRU: The first 166 certificate, your Honour, is item 13 in the first Form 1, so the file may be noted that it was placed on a Form 1, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: So what do I do there? I note--SANDILANDS: Taken into account on Form 1.47. I note that the offence on the certificate issued under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and dated 8 July 2009 is an offence which I have already taken into account on the Form 1, which contained the thirteen offences.KIRU: The second matter on the 166 certificate was taken - only one matter on the second Form 1, your Honour.48. I note in respect of the certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 dated 16 September 2009 that that offence is the same offence as the offence I took into account in sentencing Mr Hughes and which was contained on the Form 1, itself containing one offence of taking and driving a conveyance without consent.49. Mr Hughes, you have heard the sentences which I have imposed. They are mostly fixed sentences. The last one has the parole period at the end. The last one is the most serious for the reasons which I said. Overall your sentence commences - I have backdated it by five days to 1 December to take into account about five days you spent in custody in October, so it is backdated by that period, and the overall sentence I have imposed is just short of eight and a half years; it is eight years and five months. That overall sentence will expire on 30 April 2017.50. You will be in custody overall for five years and five months. That period commences on 1 December 08 and the first date on which you are eligible for consideration for parole is this date, 30 April 2014 - 30 April 2014. On that date you are eligible for parole. The Parole Authority considers your parole, as to whether they grant it or not. I do not order it. Then you are on parole for the balance of three years during which obviously you must behave yourself or you could lose your parole. Do you understand that?PRISONER: Yes sir.HIS HONOUR: Good luck.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR : Both prisoners pleaded guilty on 27 October 2009 to murdering Frederick Doldissen at Broken Hill on 21 March 2008. The offence of murder carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and attracts a standard non parole period of 20 years. The prisoner Willetts also pleaded guilty to a charge of damaging property by fire pursuant to s 195(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. That offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 The prisoners stand to be sentenced on the basis of an agreed statement of facts which is part of Exhibit A. The basis of the charge of murder, had the matter gone to trial, was that the prisoners were participating in a joint criminal enterprise, namely an assault upon the victim, with the intention to kill him or inflict serious injury. In the alternative, the Crown alleged that the prisoners were participating in a joint criminal enterprise, namely to rob the victim whilst armed and in company, and the victim was fatally wounded either immediately before, or at the time of, or immediately after the robbery. This latter basis is known in the law as felony murder. It does not require the formation of an intention to inflict serious bodily injury or to kill. 
     
      
    3 In the light of the circumstances surrounding the death of the victim, in particular the number, location and severity of the wounds on his body, I have reached the conclusion that the prisoners were engaged in a joint criminal enterprise to kill the victim, and that that agreement was formed immediately prior to the fatal assault upon him. The fact that the prisoners may have gone to the victim's premises with the intention of robbing him is not inconsistent with the subsequent formation of an agreement to kill. 
     
      
    4 The victim was known to both of the prisoners as a drug dealer in Broken Hill. On the night of 20 March 2008, Gurney went to the victim's home to purchase amphetamines. Having used the drugs, he returned to the victim's home and expressed his dissatisfaction with their quality. He asked the victim for the return of his money or the supply of better quality drugs. The victim refused. Gurney’s hostility toward the victim was fuelled by this encounter and by Gurney’s long association with the victim, whom he had known since Gurney’s teenage years. Gurney claimed to have been sexually assaulted by the victim as a child. Later that night, Gurney communicated this to the prisoner Willetts, together with the allegation that the victim had sexually assaulted a childhood friend of Gurney's, who later committed suicide. 
     
      
    5 Gurney arrived at Willetts’ home, which was a short distance from the victim’s home, at about 10pm. The prisoner Willetts was living with Mr James and his wife. Also present at the home was Willetts’ half brother Mr Harvey. Over the course of the evening and into the early hours of the next day, Willetts, Gurney and Harvey drank a quantity of bourbon. Gurney engaged in some sword play with a weapon belonging to Willetts. At some stage there was a discussion about obtaining amphetamines. The prisoners persuaded a female acquaintance to come to the house, picked them up and drive them to a Shell service station ATM so that Gurney could withdraw money to purchase drugs. Harvey left the premises shortly after 4:12 am with his wife. 
     
      
    6 Gurney ultimately withdrew $300 in cash from two ATMs in Broken Hill. The prisoners obtained $300 worth of amphetamines from their female acquaintance, who drove the prisoners to Willetts’ home and left shortly before 4:30am.  
     
      
    7 Some time after 4:15 am and before 6:45 am on 21 March 2008, the prisoners walked to the victim’s home and jointly inflicted a series of wounds upon him, one of which consisted of a stab wound to the left of centre of the lower chest area that passed through the anterior chest wall into the chest cavity, through the left ventricle of the heart, and into the posterior chest wall. This wound caused immediate and heavy blood loss, rendering it unlikely that the victim could have remained conscious for more than five minutes after the infliction of this wound. This wound and another wound which consisted of the amputation of the victim's penis were most likely inflicted using a knife. The remaining six wounds were slash type wounds inflicted by a weapon such as a sword. Those wounds were :- 
     
      
      i) to the upper outer left arm which penetrated through to the underlying muscle,  
       
      ii) to the left wrist, which penetrated through to the tendons and muscles,  
       
      iii) to the outer aspect of the upper left thigh area, that extended through to underlying muscle,  
       
      iv) to the outer aspect of the lower left leg, that penetrated to the underlying muscle and caused deep cuts in the fibula and tibia (including a fracture to the fibula). This wound was likely inflicted after the victim had fallen to the ground.  
       
      v) to the right chest wall area, causing the lateral fourth, fifth and sixth ribs on the right-hand side to fracture.  
       
      vi) to the outer aspect of the right lower leg that penetrated through to the femur. This wound was also inflicted after the victim had fallen to the ground.  
       
      
    8 In addition, there were a number of facial injuries, such as lacerations to the lower lip, an associated fracture of the teeth, and wounds to the left cheek area. The injuries to the face were consistent with the application of blunt force from a wooden axe handle, later found at Willetts’ home.  
     
      
    9 It appears that the assault upon the victim commenced in the front yard of the premises. A quantity of the victim’s blood was smeared on three motor vehicles in the front yard. A large pool of the victim’s blood was also found on the front porch of the house. These factors point to the infliction of both the facial wounds and some of the slash type wounds before the victim was dragged into the house, where further wounding occurred, notably the fatal wound to the chest and at least wounds iv) and vi) above. The prisoner Gurney also severed the victim’s penis, following a conversation with the victim wherein the victim made threats of a sexual nature to Gurney’s family. The victim was left on the floor between the lounge room and the kitchen, while the prisoners searched the victim’s home for valuable items.  
     
      
    10 After stealing a quantity of personal items and property, the prisoners left the scene. Shortly before 7am the fire brigade was called to the property which was well alight. The victim’s badly burnt body was discovered by fire brigade officers in the kitchen/lounge room area. The Crown does not submit that the prisoners were responsible for the fire at the premises.  
     
      
    11 Both of the prisoners took bags containing the stolen property to Willetts’ home. Thereafter, Willetts took steps to destroy and/or conceal the weapons used to murder the victim. He enlisted the help of a male acquaintance to dispose of the sword used in the assault, together with another sword belonging to Willetts. Both swords were cut into pieces, using a borrowed angle grinder, and buried in a concrete pour at a building site, where they were later recovered by police. The knife and the personal property stolen from the victim were burnt and buried by Willetts in a creek bed on the Silverton road. Willetts later took police to this location. These facts are the basis of the additional charge to which Willetts has pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    12 Following the arrest of both offenders, the victim’s blood was matched to staining on items of clothing and footwear belonging to each of them. 
     
      
    13 As will be self-evident from this account, the objective gravity of the offence of murder is of a high order. It must be stated unequivocally at the outset that the taking of a human life remains the paramount consideration. As the victim impact statements of 3 of the victim’s 11 children attest, the victim was a loved father who contributed in meaningful ways to the lives of his daughters. This offence deprived his children and grandchildren of an important family member. It is not to the point that the inherent worth of the victim’s life is thought by the offenders, and perhaps by some in the community, to have been forfeited by his alleged conduct towards Mr Gurney and others. The rule of law is the mark of a civilised society. It allows all of its citizens to live under its protection, confident and secure in the knowledge that if punishment is to be meted out for criminal behaviour, it will only be justified by the observance of the due process of the law. The respect of the community for the rule of law is essential to its maintenance. For these reasons, the penalty must reflect the law’s denunciation of acts of violence carried out by some members of the community against others, in the name of revenge or retribution, no matter how abhorrent the behaviour of those sought to be summarily punished. 
     
      
    14 Given the contents of the reports prepared upon Mr Gurney’s behalf (Exs 1, 2, 3 and 4), and his responsibility for severing the victim’s penis, I accept that the sexual assaults upon him described in those reports probably took place. Whilst Mr Gurney never reported the assaults to anyone in authority, there is sufficient evidence of his disclosure of sexual assaults at the hands of the victim to a health professional in 2004 and 2005 to establish that fact to the requisite standard : see R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47. To the extent that this constituted a partial, perhaps primary, motive for the assault upon the victim, the other motive being dissatisfaction with the quality of the drugs supplied by the victim, it is relevant to Mr Gurney’s moral culpability for the offence and to the question of personal deterrence. It may also be relevant to an assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation, but in my view it has no bearing on the need for general deterrence to be reflected in the sentence to be imposed. There is no suggestion that Mr Gurney’s capacity to appreciate the consequences of his conduct was in any way impaired.  
     
      
    15 On any view, this was a sustained and vicious attack, committed while both of the prisoners were on conditional liberty. The victim, a 61 year old man, was met with the combined force of two armed men, each approximately half his age. The confrontation occurred in the early hours of the morning. It seems likely that the victim was called out from his home into the front yard. The sword was obviously struck repeatedly at the victim with considerable force, given the depth of the wounds. The fatal wound indicates that the knife was literally plunged into the victim’s chest, at a time when the victim had already lost a considerable amount of blood and was obviously completely at the mercy of the offenders. As I have already noted, the brutality of the assault, and its continuation after the victim was prone on the floor, is eloquent of an intention to kill. The gratuitous cruelty meted out to the victim by genital disfigurement aggravates the gravity of the offence.  
     
      
    16 The prisoners went to the premises armed, suggesting that they anticipated the use of violence towards the victim, extending beyond the need to simply defend themselves if the victim should prove aggressive. I am of the view that they had resolved to punish the victim to some extent, together with extracting whatever “compensation” they could for the poor quality of the victim’s drugs, but that the agreement to kill him did not crystallize until the assault commenced. Both of the prisoners were significantly disinhibited by their consumption of drugs and alcohol, but this in no way operates to excuse their actions. Once the assault began, they each gave full expression to their own anger, albeit the genesis of that anger was different in each case. For these reasons, I would not be prepared to find that the murder was premeditated. Rather, it was a spontaneous understanding between the prisoners that the victim should die for the wrongs they believed he had committed. 
     
      
    17 The Crown submits that the objective features of the offence and those subjective features that are causally connected to the commission of the offence, namely a diagnosis in Mr Gurney’s case of post traumatic stress disorder arising from sexual abuse as a child and the lesser role played by Mr Willetts in the infliction of the wounds upon the victim, place this offence in the high range of objective gravity, close to a worst case. The submission from the prisoners’ counsel is that the objective gravity of the offence is no higher than mid range. My assessment of the offence is that it falls between those two positions, that is, markedly above the mid range for offences of this type, although not approaching the worst case. Without the contribution of Mr Gurney’s psychological condition to the commission of the offence, to which I shall return, and the relatively spontaneous nature of the offence, I would agree with the Crown’s submission. Mr Willetts had no such personal motive, but it is accepted that he did not engage in the mutilation of the victim’s genitalia.  
     
      
    18 Given this assessment and the prisoners’ pleas of guilty, the standard non parole period, whilst remaining a guidepost or check for the purposes of determining the non parole period to be imposed, ought not diminish the significance of the maximum penalty in this case.  
     
      
    19 I would assess the objective gravity of the offence under s 192 of the Crimes Act as relatively low. It was committed by Mr Willetts as part of his attempts to destroy the evidence of the principal offence. In that regard, it forms part of the objective circumstances surrounding the murder. The Crown does not submit that any additional penalty is warranted for this offence. 
     
      
    20 The extent of the discount to be afforded to the prisoners for the utilitarian value of their pleas of guilty is a matter of some controversy. It may be accepted that the timing of the plea and the complexity of the case are the paramount considerations, but both of the prisoners claimed that there were cogent reasons for the failure to enter pleas at the earliest opportunity, that is, at or immediately after committal.  
     
      
    21 In Mr Gurney’s case, it is said that he had always indicated that a plea of guilty would be entered and that he would provide assistance to the Crown, but whether the plea would be to manslaughter, on the grounds of substantial impairment, or to murder was an issue he could not resolve until all the psychiatric reports were received. Thus, he confirmed a plea of guilty to murder and the provision of assistance on 2 October 2009. It is also submitted that this communication in open court exercised some indeterminate influence over Mr Willetts’ decision to change his plea of not guilty, entered on 4 August 2009, to one of guilty of murder. Mr Willetts’ change of heart was foreshadowed on 9 October 2009. 
     
      
    22 In Mr Willetts’ case, it is said that his solicitors were refused legal aid for the purposes of briefing from the private bar on the basis that a public defender was briefed in the matter. This appears in a letter of 9 September 2009. However, on 23 September 2009 the Public Defender informed Mr Willetts’ solicitor that a brief in the matter could not be accepted. It was only then that Mr Clarke, who now represents Mr Willetts, was briefed to appear. In those circumstances, it is submitted that Mr Willetts was compromised in his ability to enter a plea of guilty at any earlier time. That said, Mr Willetts has been represented by the same firm of solicitors since his committal. 
     
      
    23 It is often impossible for the Court to draw reliable conclusions with respect to the reasons for the entry of a plea of guilty at a particular time. In some cases it may be purely speculative, in others there may be evidence upon which a conclusion may be based. The submissions by the prisoners on this issue overlook the fact that until the Court is assured of a plea of guilty, the Crown must proceed on the basis that the matter will go to trial. That necessarily involves the expenditure of public monies and the retention of a lengthy trial date at a remote sittings. That is why the emphasis in the nomination of a discount lies on the fact of the plea and when it occurs relative to the start of the trial. That is the only measure that allows the Court to determine to what extent the plea has saved the community the expense and inconvenience of a trial. 
     
      
    24 In this case, the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty is more than token. The pleas were communicated to the Court and to the Crown sufficiently in advance of the trial date to allow witnesses to be called off and other resources to be saved. The trial was likely to be of 4 to 6 weeks duration, given that the Crown case depended to some extent upon a quantity of forensic evidence. In these circumstances, I would discount the sentence to be imposed upon Mr Willetts by 15%. 
     
      
    25 Mr Gurney stands in a somewhat different position, in so far as he offered to provide assistance to the Crown and his willingness to co-operate with the authorities prompted to some extent the change of plea by Mr Willetts. The Crown maintains that Mr Gurney’s interview with police on 16 October 2009 would have been of limited assistance in the trial against Mr Willetts, and that Mr Willetts had already made admissions as to his involvement in the offence. Nonetheless, Mr Gurney is entitled to some recognition for that offer of assistance. In his case, I would discount the sentence to be imposed by an aggregate discount of 20%. Any greater discount would, in my opinion, result in a sentence that is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence. 
     
      
    26 I turn to the subjective features of each of the offenders. Before doing so, I note that neither prisoner expressed genuine remorse, beyond statements to others that suggest regret for the consequences of their actions, rather than contrition. 
     
      
    27 The prisoner Gurney is presently 29 years of age. He was born in Broken Hill and lived with his parents and older brother in a supportive family environment, completing secondary school to year 10 and then completing a four-year TAFE course whilst apprenticed as a diesel mechanic with the RTA. When he left that employment he was abusing illicit drugs, principally cannabis and amphetamines, the latter intravenously from the age of 18. He formed a relationship with a woman who overdosed, which prompted the prisoner’s transfer to Melbourne where he lived with his brother and worked for Telstra. He formed another relationship in Melbourne. When he returned to Broken Hill, his then partner and their child, now 5, went with him. He had a number of jobs repairing machinery. His drug abuse continued to escalate to a point where he attended a detox centre in Adelaide. The prisoner appeared to develop psychotic symptoms, which resulted in his admission to Glenside Psychiatric Hospital in that city. 
     
      
    28 Unsurprisingly, the prisoner’s drug abuse coupled with excessive consumption of alcohol resulted in sleeping difficulties. A benzodiazepine was prescribed and added to the prisoner’s cocktail of drugs. Ultimately, the prisoner’s waking and sleeping moments were almost entirely drug regulated. The memories of sexual abuse, both by the victim and other males, contributed to a heightened anxiety around adult males. Since entering prison and ceasing his drug abuse, the prisoner's health has improved, both mentally and physically. 
     
      
    29 Dr Quadrio made a number of psychiatric diagnoses, including chronic/complex post-traumatic stress disorder, drug-related psychotic episodes, a personality disorder of mixed type, poly substance abuse/dependence and hypoactive sexual disorder/post-traumatic disorder. The post-traumatic stress disorder is thought to be an outcome of childhood sexual abuse, which leads directly to personality disorganisation and associated substance abuse. Dr Quadrio's opinion is that the prisoner was in a chronic state of mental disturbance arising out of these conditions at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    30 All of these conditions, together with the consumption of amphetamines, alcohol and Serepax on the night of the offence contributed to its commission. The prisoner's behavioural instability, intense anger and aggression found full expression in the assault against the victim. Whilst this disordered state was not sufficient to constitute substantial impairment for the purposes of reducing the offence from murder to manslaughter, it reflects on the prisoner's culpability for the offence. In short, the prisoner was not able to exercise the judgement and self-control of a reasonable person. 
     
      
    31 The prisoner's criminal history is also consistent with the type of offences committed whilst affected by drugs. It begins in 1999 with a number of public order offences and continues in 2000 and 2001 with offences related to the damage of property and assaults. Similar offences in relation to assaults and destruction of property occurred in 2002 and 2006. In 2006 the prisoner received an 18 month suspended sentence for an offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm. That bond was breached and the prisoner was called up and sentenced on the 22nd of September 2008. In the result, the prisoner is presently serving an aggregate sentence for a series of offences, that sentence dating from 1 April 2008 and expiring on 29 December 2009. Some measure of concurrency will be allowed in order to accommodate the principle of totality. 
     
      
    32 Despite the prisoner's abuse of drugs and alcohol, he appears to function within the average range. He has been receiving counselling within the prison system and has reported a marked improvement in his concentration and mood. He is taking a relatively high dose of antipsychotic medication as determined by his treating psychiatrist. The prisoner's long-term abstinence from drugs and alcohol remains problematic but there are indications that the prisoner has finally gained some insight into the effects of his substance abuse. I regard his prospects of rehabilitation as guarded, but there is no issue with respect to future dangerousness in my view, principally because the prisoner’s lengthy incarceration will facilitate long-term treatment. It follows that I do not regard specific deterrence as a prominent factor in the sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    33 The prisoner Willetts is presently 37 years of age. Mr Willetts was adopted at birth by a loving and supportive family and lived in the Emu plains area for most of his adult life. His parents gave birth to a sister approximately 3 years after Mr Willetts was adopted. When Mr Willetts was 13 years of age, his father died of a heart attack, an event which the prisoner witnessed whilst at home alone with his sister. His father's death deeply affected the prisoner, according to his sister who gave evidence in the course of these proceedings. 
     
      
    34 The support and stability provided by that family is evidenced by the prisoner's stable school and work history. He completed year 10 and a fitter/machinist apprenticeship before commencing a lengthy employment history. He was always able to find employment and was generally a well adjusted individual, but for his experimentation with amphetamines and opiates from the age of 18. The prisoner began using amphetamines on a regular basis from the age of 20, that consumption escalating to a habit of up to 3g a day prior to the offence. The prisoner's mother and sister noticed significant changes in his personality during these years. 
     
      
    35 At the age of 28, seemingly as a result of a comment by a relative, the prisoner discovered that he was adopted. According to his sister, the prisoner was profoundly affected by this disclosure. Within a matter of weeks he received contact from his birth mother and travelled to Broken Hill to spend time with his family. He established a positive relationship with his birth mother and siblings and obtained employment with a local mining company in Broken Hill. However, ultimately he was dismissed from that employment due to testing positive twice to illicit drugs. The prisoner's birth mother has since passed away. The prisoner met his birth father on two occasions only. 
     
      
    36 The prisoner's health is compromised by a genetic condition which manifests itself in very high blood pressure. The condition requires complex medication. The prisoner was hospitalised in Mildura in February 2008 for a number of days following presentation with a severe headache, severe hypertension and blurred vision. Justice Health records indicate that the prisoner's medical regime is being maintained. 
     
      
    37 The prisoner has a five-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. He has regular contact with his daughter and has maintained a supportive relationship with his ex-partner. That relationship was characterised by mutual illicit drug use and domestic violence. The prisoner enjoys the continuing support of his adoptive family. 
     
      
    38 A report under the hand of Nicole Johnson, a consultant psychologist (Exhibit 5), indicates that the prisoner was difficult to interview in that his conversation was limited and his affect “incongruent with some of the emotionally distressing content of what was being discussed.” The prisoner has no apparent cognitive deficits or personality disorder. He has been seen by a psychiatrist whilst in custody in Wellington and was prescribed antidepressant medication. 
     
      
    39 Ms Johnson was unable to determine whether the prisoner was experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety at the time of the offence. There is no doubt that the prisoner was heavily affected by amphetamines and that his long-term substance abuse affected his ability to function generally. The prisoner also reported that his heavy consumption of alcohol on that night was uncharacteristic. The evidence from the prisoner's sister however appears to support the conclusion that the prisoner's behaviour changed for the worse in the months and years following the discovery of his adoption. In these circumstances, it appears to me to be a reasonable conclusion that the prisoner was suffering from depression at the time of the offence. However, I am not persuaded that such a condition compromised the prisoner's capacity to form rational judgements to a significant extent. 
     
      
    40 The prisoner’s criminal history commences in 1999. He came to notice initially through the commission of driving offences. It is significant that the first recorded convictions for assault occur in Broken Hill in 2005. Other convictions for assault and drug offences followed in 2007. The prisoner has never served a sentence of imprisonment. This was the basis for a submission that the Court should find special circumstances, but the structure of the sentence to be imposed allows for a sufficiently lengthy period of conditional liberty. 
     
      
    41 The prisoner has been in protective custody at his own request. The prisoner Gurney also potentially faces some form of protection if his willingness to give evidence against his co-offender becomes known in the prison system. There was no evidence before me capable of establishing that either prisoner would suffer harsher conditions of incarceration than the general prison population, to the extent that their sentences would necessarily be more onerous. I do not regard the status of either prisoner to warrant a reduction in the sentence that is otherwise appropriate to the commission of these offences. 
     
      
    42 Mr Willetts’ prospects of rehabilitation are difficult to assess in the light of his reluctance to come to terms with his conduct. One can hope that he will acquire insight over time. He is sufficiently intelligent to re-assess his life and resolve to cease drug abuse, particularly given his risk of high blood pressure. I do not regard him as a vehicle for specific deterrence. 
     
      
    43 Taking all of these matters into account, I propose to sentence as follows :- 
     
      
      Ryan Gurney, you are convicted of the murder of Frederick Doldissen. You are sentenced to a non parole period of 18 years, to date from 23 March 2009, expiring 22 March 2027, with a balance of term of 6 years, expiring 22 March 2033. You are eligible for release on 23 March 2027.  
       
      
    44 Aaron Willetts, you are convicted of the murder of Frederick Doldissen. You are sentenced to a non parole period of 19 years, to date from 22 March 2008, expiring 21 March 2027, with a balance of term of 6 years and 6 months, expiring 21 September 2033. You are eligible for release on 22 March 2027. 
     
      
       
      You are also convicted of the offence of damage property by fire. You are sentenced to a fixed term of 2 years, to date from 22 March 2008, expiring 21 March 2010.  
       
      
    45 I recommend that you be permitted to serve your sentence at Wellington correctional facility.

   JUDGMENT1. Danuta Cini appeals to this court from a conviction imposed at the Blacktown Local Court on 27 July 2009 by Magistrate Keady. Mrs Cini was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, which is a crime against s 59(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.2. She argues in this court, through Mr Gunning of counsel, that I should not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of her guilt of that crime.3. Mr Kiru, who appears for the respondent Director of Public Prosecutions argues that the evidence is such that I can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.4. There were tendered in the appeal the exhibits before the magistrate, including a record of interview between the police and Mrs Cini. In addition, I have read the transcript of the evidence before the learned magistrate.5. The prosecution called three witnesses, a police officer named Constable Weisback and a security officer named Andrew Burrows, in addition to the person who claimed to be the victim of the assault, Mirjana Speljko.6. Mrs Cini gave evidence herself before the magistrate.7. There were no eye witnesses to what happened, apart from Mrs Cini and Ms Speljko.8. The events giving rise to Mrs Cini being charged occurred in a shopping centre car park on 17 December 2008 at Blacktown. Mrs Speljko said that she came back to her car in the car park and suspected that Mrs Cini had damaged her, Mrs Speljko’s, car. 9. I should observe at this stage that Mrs Cini and Ms Speljko are neighbours; they live next door to each other. There is evidence from both witnesses that there has been hostility between them for many years.10. Returning to Ms Speljko’s account, she noticed when she returned to her car that her car had been scratched. She suspected that the scratch had been made by Mrs Cini. She saw Mrs Cini about to leave the car park in her own car. She put her hand out on to Mrs Cini’s arm, saying “You can’t go anywhere. I want to talk to you, we need to sort this out.”11. Ms Speljko said what happened then was that “Mrs Cini then came out of her car, she stopped her car, she came out of the car and she said that not to touch her, and she just went for me”. Ms Speljko’s evidence was that Ms Cini grabbed her and was too strong for Ms Speljko. Ms Cini, Ms Speljko said, grabbed her by the hair. She was not strong enough to defend herself. The fight was broken up by other people.12. Hair was pulled out of Ms Speljko’s head by Ms Cini. The other people who broke up the fight may not have given evidence - I say may not have given evidence because Mr Burrows did, but his evidence clearly relates to events after the fight. 13. Ms Cini’s account of the events on the same day was that she returned to the car park and was about to get into her car when she received a blow to the back of her head which knocked off her glasses, poking her in the right eye. She turned around and found that Ms Speljko was there. She tried to push her away, but Ms Speljko kept coming back, punching her. Eventually she got away by pushing her away. She denied scratching her car before these events.14. Mr Burrows, the security officer, turned up. He found a clump of hair on the ground. Ms Speljko reported the matter to the police. The police interviewed Ms Cini, who gave a detailed account in the record of the interview.15. The question for me is whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Cini is guilty of the charge. There are no eye witnesses who were called by the prosecution who could give a direct account of the altercation between the two persons.16. There was, in my opinion, clearly a physical altercation. Both persons received injuries. I accept that a photograph of Ms Speljko’s head shows a patch where there is missing hair. I accept that the hair on the ground clearly came out as a result of the fight.17. On the other hand, there is photographic evidence produced by Ms Cini of injuries which are consistent with her account of her glasses being knocked off.18. There is, as I said, a long history of hostility between these two persons.19. I am not in a position, because I have not seen either give evidence, and because it is not otherwise obvious, to determine that either of them is not telling the truth. However, it must be the case, in my view, that they should not be regarded as independent observers to these events. Their evidence must be seen as coming from, in each case, the point of view of a person who felt a great deal of hostility to the other person involved.20. There are unsatisfactory aspects about the evidence of both witnesses. Both Mr Kiru and Mr Gunning highlighted those aspects. 21. As Mr Kiru pointed out, the evidence given by Ms Cini before the magistrate was inconsistent with the account given by her to the police insofar as what happened immediately before the physical altercation. It was, as Mr Kiru said on that point, the complete opposite. He pointed to the evidence of the hair on the ground as being corroborative of the prosecution case. The evidence of the hair, in my view, is corroborative of the fact that there was a physical altercation between the two persons, but not strongly corroborative of the view that Ms Cini was guilty of an unlawful assault on Ms Speljko. 22. Ms Speljko’s evidence had some unsatisfactory aspects as well. In her cross-examination by Mr Gunning, who appeared in the Local Court for Ms Cini, as well as here, she was not forthcoming in answering questions about whether she had placed her hand on Ms Cini’s arm as Ms Cini was attempting to drive away from the car park. She acknowledged in cross-examination that she had said to Ms Cini, “You are not going anywhere from here. We have to talk to security.” She acknowledged, after three or four attempts by Mr Gunning to ask the same question, that she had tried to hold Ms Cini by her right arm.23. There was also an unsatisfactory aspect of her evidence in that the security officer witness, Mr Burrows, gave evidence that Ms Speljko had told him that her car had been swiped or scratched whilst Mrs Cini was driving out. He confirmed that Ms Speljko said to him that “Mrs Cini had brushed her car whilst driving out”. He said that “the exact words that she used at me” were “that it had been brushed or scratched”.24. When Ms Speljko was asked whether she had told Mr Burrows that Ms Cini had brushed her car whilst driving out, Ms Speljko replied “I have never said that, because she wasn’t next to my car.”25. Mr Gunning also says that the prosecution has not excluded the reasonable possibility that Ms Cini was acting in self-defence. That submission is based upon the admission by Ms Speljko that she tried to hold Ms Cini by her right arm, saying “You are not going anywhere from here. We have to talk to security.”26. To my mind, the state of the evidence is such that I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Cini is guilty of this offence. There are, as I have said, unsatisfactory aspects about both witnesses’ evidence, but it is the evidence of the witness who supports the case against Ms Cini that I have to be satisfied of beyond reasonable doubt in this case. The aspects of that evidence which I have found to be unsatisfactory mean that I cannot reach that degree of satisfaction about Ms Cini’s guilt. Also, I accept the submission of Mr Gunning that, on the evidence which I have referred to, there has not been excluded the reasonable possibility that Ms Cini was acting in self-defence at the time.27. Accordingly, under s 20(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, I determine this appeal against conviction by setting aside the conviction.28. I will return the exhibits to my associate to place with the court file. Anything else?KIRU: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Thank you both for your assistance.SHORT ADJOURNMENTHIS HONOUR: Now, there is something I had to attend to, some other order, some other matter.KIRU: As a consequence of this conviction, your Honour, an AVO was imposed.HIS HONOUR: Is that the subject of an appeal, Mr Gunning?KIRU: If the conviction is set aside, your Honour, there can’t be any AVO, because that’s a consequence of the conviction.HIS HONOUR: So what do I do?GUNNING: I would ask your Honour set aside not only the conviction but the orders that the magistrate had made. That would deal--HIS HONOUR: What’s my power to do that?KIRU: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: What’s my power?KIRU: Because the AVO was the consequence of the conviction, if your Honour could look at the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007, section 39, subsection (1)--HIS HONOUR: Sorry, now just say that again, Mr Kiru. KIRU: The Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence Act) 2007, that’s in volume 1. I can hand u-p--HIS HONOUR: In volume 1, did you say?KIRU: Yes.HIS HONOUR: Where is it, towards the back?KIRU: That’s after the Crimes Act--HIS HONOUR: I’ve got it. And the section was?KIRU: 39, subsection (1).HIS HONOUR: All right, just let me read that. Is this a domestic violence offence? Or is it an offence against section 13? How does that - section 13--KIRU: Even though they say domestic, it says apprehended violence order, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: What’s the definition of a domestic violence offence? See section 11. How was it that such an order was made? How does it fit into section 39? There had to be a domestic relationship, according to this. I assume there wasn’t.GUNNING: Your Honour, perhaps if I could assist with a fairly short point. Firstly, I apologise for your Honour having to come back. Your Honour did ask if there were any orders that needed to be made, and I didn’t say so. The appeal, the notice of appeal states that Ms Cini appeals on the following grounds, (a)--HIS HONOUR: I’ll just look at the papers, thanks.GUNNING: So if your Honour has the front page there--HIS HONOUR: I do.GUNNING: It will say, below the details of the appellant, “I am appealing on the following grounds - cross out which is not applicable: (a) I am appealing the above conviction/order because I am not guilty, and (b)” - so because one of the grounds is an appeal against conviction or order, “because I am not guilty”, that would enable your Honour to not only of course set aside the conviction, but the order as well, the AVO, and in any event, the AVO, as I understand it, followed the conviction for an assault.HIS HONOUR: How?GUNNING: I don’t have the particular provision of the Crimes--HIS HONOUR: Mr Kiru says it’s section 39. I don’t see - was it her Honour or his Honour?GUNNING: His Honour.HIS HONOUR: Did his Honour say anything in the transcript about - I’m just wondering what power the magistrate had to make such an order.GUNNING: Having a look at the transcript again, your Honour--HIS HONOUR: What does it say in the transcript?GUNNING: On page 50, lines 47 to 53--HIS HONOUR: He says, “I am also going to make the apprehended violence order sought.”GUNNING: Yes. So what we are seeking by the appeal is not only, of course, for the conviction to be set aside, but for that order to be set aside as well, which is stated on the notice of appeal.HIS HONOUR: So you’ve appealed against the - yes, there is an appeal against - it looks as though it’s on this file as well. All right. Is it under the same - the appeal provisions for - section 84. It looks as though section 84 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 subsection (2) is what you need to be looking at: 
     
      
      “An appeal may be made to the District Court by the defendant against the making of an apprehended violence order by the Local Court. An appeal under subsection (2) may be made under part 3 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act,” 
       
      
    which is the same part, 
     
      
      “ 
      in the same way as an application by a defendant against a conviction.” 
       
      
    Okay, and you’ve appealed against that as well, is that right?GUNNING: Yes.29. I will add to my orders, under section 84 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007, and section 20 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, I determine the appeal against the apprehended violence order by setting aside the order. Does that deal with it?GUNNING: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I thought there was, there was separate legislation, the domestic violence legislation deals with appeals, and so in effect there have been two appeals, not one. There is an appeal against the conviction and an appeal against the order. That’s the way it seems to me. Does that sound right?GUNNING: I think so, your Honour, yes.KIRU: Yes.

   JUDGMENT1. Francis Tolentino was a young man who was in a vulnerable position. He was vulnerable because of an addiction to drugs. Another person, who was clearly a criminal, took advantage of that vulnerability and convinced Mr Tolentino to supply him with the private information of persons on the databank of the bank that Mr Tolentino worked for. 2. This was discovered and Mr Tolentino was charged with four offences under the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995. Each of the four offences was the same. The offence is called dishonestly dealing in personal financial information and is again s 480.4(1) of the Criminal Code Act. Each of the four offences committed by Mr Tolentino carries a maximum of five years imprisonment, fixed by that Act. 3. It is important in all cases where a judge sentences a person for the judge to set out what the criminal behaviour was so that an assessment can be made of how serious the crime was in the particular case. 4. Mr Tolentino was employed by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. He had been employed for some years and in the course of his employment had access to the bank’s computer systems including the financial and personal details of the bank’s customers. He was approached by a man whose surname was Ying. Mr Ying asked Mr Tolentino for information from the bank’s computer system. In some instances he named the persons whose information he wanted. It is important in appreciating the nature of the crime to say something of the circumstances in which Mr Ying convinced Mr Tolentino to supply him with the information on the four occasions that he did.5. Mr Ying was a friend of a friend from Mr Tolentino’s past. Mr Tolentino had a troubled background, which I will refer to in more detail later, but at one stage he mixed with undesirable people and got into the habit of taking illegal drugs. He was approached by Mr Ying some time in 2007 and asked for the information. Mr Tolentino was reluctant to provide the information, understandably because he was concerned for his job, perhaps also because he knew it was the wrong thing to do. Mr Ying made it clear to Mr Tolentino that there would be trouble for Mr Tolentino and his family if Mr Tolentino did not provide the information sought by Mr Ying. 6. Mr Tolentino, who was called by Ms Hampel, who appeared for him, to give evidence, made several attempts to avoid giving the information to Mr Ying. For example, he gave him incorrect information a couple of times, hoping that that would demonstrate that he, Mr Tolentino, was an unreliable source of information, but Mr Ying persevered. On other occasions Mr Tolentino did not answer telephone calls from Mr Ying, but still Mr Ying persevered. Mr Ying threatened Mr Tolentino on some occasions. He made it clear that other persons who had not cooperated with him had been kidnapped and tortured. Mr Ying showed Mr Tolentino a taser weapon which Mr Ying had. In fact Mr Ying said that Mr Tolentino should not say no to Mr Ying’s request because Mr Ying knew where Mr Tolentino worked and where he lived and said “You need to do it”. 7. In the process of supplying the information on the four occasions that he did Mr Tolentino was not offered any money for the information but did take the opportunity to use heroin to which he had been addicted on the occasions that he met up with Mr Ying. Mr Ying too was a heroin addict and made it available to Mr Tolentino. There was, I accept, no agreement, specific agreement between Mr Tolentino and Mr Ying to supply the information in return for heroin but as I said the heroin was used in the context of meeting with Mr Ying to supply the information.8. The police discovered the leakage of information, not as a result of any confession by Mr Tolentino, but because they executed a search warrant in Queensland and found documents containing the personal information. They then executed a search warrant on Mr Tolentino’s place and found another document containing personal information. All in all four documents were found containing information, such as credit card, personal bank accounts, dates of birth of four specified persons. Mr Tolentino was arrested by agents of the Australian Federal Police and interviewed over two days on 4 and 5 December 2007. He was cooperative in both interviews and supplied details of his own offences and as much information as he could about Mr Ying. Over a year later on Christmas Eve last year a court attendance notice was issued and served on Mr Tolentino, charging him with the four offences that I am sentencing him for. He pleaded guilty in January 2009. 9. In his evidence Mr Tolentino confirmed information contained in a helpful pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation and Parole Service. He had a difficult background. He was born in the Philippines. His parents separated when he was at a young age. His mother emigrated to Australia before he did. He was left with elderly relatives whom he had to look after. At one stage he was kidnapped for some hours. He himself came to Australia when he was about ten years old and lived with his mother and his stepfather. He did not get on well with his stepfather and was the victim of verbal abuse. He left High School in Year 10 and, as I said, started mixing with the wrong people. He commenced using heroin, which he smoked from about the age of sixteen or seventeen and his criminal record reflects the fact that he had a troubled childhood. He is now twenty-five and when he was about sixteen he committed the crimes of larceny and armed robbery for which he was dealt with by the Children’s Court. As an adult his main offences have been summary offences concerning possession of drugs. 10. He has had fairly steady employment since he left school. In fact his best job was probably with the bank from which he was dismissed once his dishonesty had been discovered. He has had other employment since then including over a year with Optus. He has a friend whose father employs him in times of need and he is presently employed by his friend’s father at the father’s business. 11. He has been connected for some eight years now with Maria Hacinas and they have been engaged for some four years. They have two children, including one who is very young. Ms Hacinas to her credit has always supported Mr Tolentino. In fact at one stage he managed to get himself out of his drug habit by attending a rehabilitation centre daily. 12. He expressed remorse and regret for his offences and appreciated the impact which it would have on the persons whose information he disclosed. Unfortunately he slipped back to drug usage after successfully completing the rehabilitation and the offences which I am sentencing him for arose, as I said, from his vulnerability to drug addiction and the persons with whom he mixed. Maria Hacinas is employed part-time with a pathology company and gave evidence of Mr Tolentino’s remorse and of the difficulties that she would have with the children if he were to be sentenced to full-time imprisonment. 13. Despite being charged with these offences, almost a year ago now, Mr Tolentino has once again meddled with illegal drugs. According to the pre-sentence report he has tested positive to opiates and methamphetamines in the middle of this year. Mr Tolentino explained that those occasions were the result of peer pressure and he resorted to drugs when he became depressed. He now has an arrangement where his salary is paid directly into Ms Hacinas’ account so that he has no access to funds. Surprisingly he has not had specific counselling directed to his troubled background, nor apart from the drug rehabilitation course, any recent counselling focused on his drug addiction. 14. The Probation and Parole officer who prepared the helpful report had reservations about Mr Tolentino’s commitment to rehabilitation. Mr Pintamalli in his helpful written and oral submissions emphasised the seriousness of the crimes committed by Mr Tolentino, with particular emphasis on the fact that they involved a breach of trust. He emphasised the importance of general deterrence so far as bank employees are concerned, as well as the importance of the community knowing that breaches of privacy so far as their information is concerned will be punished sternly so that their information will remain protected.15. Ms Hampel in her helpful submissions emphasised the circumstances in which her client committed the crimes, and put stress on the threats that her client had been subjected to. There was, she said, a significant level of duress. The threat to be kidnapped or at least the reference to another person being kidnapped would have as she said, hit a raw nerve so far as Mr Tolentino was concerned. She acknowledged the need for her client to address his drug addiction and emphasised also the fact that there was no evidence of any specific loss to any victims of the offences. She emphasised also the resistance which her client had originally put up to Mr Ying who was approaching him about committing the offences.16. I need to assess the objective seriousness of the crimes committed by Mr Tolentino. They do involve as Mr Pintamalli argues, a significant breach of trust. Employees of banks are given custody of information about all of us on the basis that they will not disclose that information. Mr Tolentino breached that trust which was the basis of his employment.17. On the other hand it was not, I am satisfied, a straight commercial transaction where Mr Tolentino received money for information. Indeed I would not characterise it as receiving drugs for the information. As I said, the drugs were supplied in the context of him re-engaging in the criminal milieu that he had mixed with previously, in particular, Mr Ying it seems was a drug taker himself. 18. Another aspect which mitigates in my opinion the seriousness of this offence is the real fear which I accept Mr Tolentino experienced in the threats which Mr Ying posed to him and to his family. It also mitigates the seriousness of his offending that he made efforts to be an unreliable source of information so that Mr Ying would not persevere in taxing him for what he wanted him to provide. There were also, I am satisfied, fortunately no losses sustained by the persons who had their information disclosed apart from the loss of privacy involved in the fact of committing these offences.19. The crimes were committed over some months as Mr Pintamalli points out, and they are the sorts of crimes which are difficult to detect. In this case, as I said they were discovered as a result of search warrant. I do not accept that the action of Mr Tolentino involved the deliberate supply of information to a criminal syndicate in the sense that it should be classified in that way.20. Subjectively, as I have said, Mr Tolentino has acknowledged the seriousness of his offending and is clearly remorseful about what he has done. His plea of guilty and a confession to the police, combined with his supply of information about Mr Ying indicates in my view a clear intention to facilitate the course of justice. Although he has respectable and good character references from persons who know him, these crimes are the sorts of crimes which are committed by persons with a clean record and therefore his good character does not carry as much weight as it might otherwise as Mr Pintamalli correctly argued. 21. His criminal record was mostly as a child and, as an adult, reflects his drug taking habits. His background is a troubled one as I have said, and as the Probation and Parole officer said, he experienced a disordered early childhood and has ongoing drug use issues. The impact of a fulltime custodial sentence on his family would obviously be significant but I am not satisfied that it is a factor which reaches the level of significance required by the authorities for it to be given significant weight.22. I need to ensure as s 16A(2)(p) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 provides that Mr Tolentino is adequately punished for the offence. As I said, general deterrence and reassurance of the public is important for offences such as this. I have determined that a custodial sentence is appropriate but I have determined that it should in effect be suspended. Such a sentence in my view would combine the seriousness that the community regards this crime as carrying, but at the same time provide Mr Tolentino with an opportunity to finally get his life back into order as a young man of his age should do.HIS HONOUR: Now I will just suspend my remarks there because I will just need your assistance Mr Pintamalli and Ms Hampel regarding the nature of the sentence which I impose. Is it s 20(1)(b)?HAMPEL: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: That’s it. And so I sentence him to imprisonment but direct that he be released upon giving security--PINTAMALLI: Request that he be released forthwith pursuant to the reconnaissance release order.HIS HONOUR: Good.PINTAMALLI: And then your Honour would begin the process of basically imposing the reconnaissance release order setting a fee for a security, a surety for a period to be of good behaviour for up to five years.HIS HONOUR: Okay.PINTAMALLI: And then any conditions that your Honour may or may not wish to place.HIS HONOUR: I’ll do that. Okay.PINTAMALLI: And obviously your Honour will have to indicate the date that the reconnaissance commences and the date that it ends.HIS HONOUR: And I have to specify a sentence as well, don’t I?PINTAMALLI: Yes you’ll have to specify custodial sentence and you say however for x amount of time, however you will be released forthwith pursuant to the reconnaissance release order, yes.HIS HONOUR: Yes. And I don’t specify a non-parole period, do I?PINTAMALLI: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: That would occur if he breached the reconnaissance and came back for sentence.PINTAMALLI: If he comes back and then he’s - were to be convicted for a breach of the reconnaissance order, then yes, that will then trigger--HIS HONOUR: Thank you. I’ll commence the process and then I might need to just get - you agree with what--HAMPEL: I agree with that your Honour, yes.HIS HONOUR: Okay thanks.23. I regard an appropriate sentence for each of the four charges as two years imprisonment. I propose to deal with the case under s 20 of the Crimes Act 1914. 24. Accordingly, the orders which I make are these. Under s 20(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), I convict Mr Tolentino of the four offences of dishonesty dealing in personal financial information, and I sentence him to two years imprisonment in respect of each of the four offences. But I direct by order in accordance with s 20(1)(b) that Mr Tolentino be released forthwith upon giving security forthwith. Now I’ll suspend it there. HIS HONOUR: With surety or without surety?PINTAMALLI: Technically, once the individual signs, will have to enter some sort of nominal fee.HIS HONOUR: A surety?PINTAMALLI: That can be either a self-surety as it’s called incorrectly, or a surety, which means a security of any amount that your Honour sees fit. That money doesn’t actually--HIS HONOUR: All right. What’s the usual that would be imposed in a case such--PINTAMALLI: $500 to $1,000 your Honour is the range that most, it doesn’t actually mean that - to assist the defendant it doesn’t mean he actually has to pay that money.HIS HONOUR: No, no. I understand.PINTAMALLI: Yes.HIS HONOUR: All right I’ll return to the remarks. 25. With a surety in each case of $500 by reconnaissance, the security being that he will comply with the following conditions: that he will be of good behaviour for two years; that he will during the period of two years, comply with these conditions; that he subject himself to supervision by the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service, and accept their reasonable recommendations and directions so far as the following - referral for counselling in relation to unresolved drug issues, random urinalysis to monitor any drug use, referral for intervention in relation to current financial situation, and referral to a psychologist for assessment in relation to childhood issues. 
     
      
    26. For the purpose of that supervision, he is to report to the Blacktown District Office of the Probation and Parole Service on or before Monday 16 November 2009. Now Mr Pintamalli and Ms Hampel, are there any formal orders I need to--PINTAMALLI: Just to confirm your Honour that the reconnaissance release order commences on 9/11/2009 and ceases on 8/11/2011.HIS HONOUR: Thank you. PINTAMALLI: And also your Honour, the Crown--HIS HONOUR: Just a moment. 27. The reconnaissance commences today 9 November 2009 and ceases on 8 November 2011. Yes.PINTAMALLI: The Crown will also be seeking identification orders pursuant to s 3ZL your Honour, either fingerprint or a photograph of the offender.HAMPEL: That’s not opposed your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right, what’s the section and what Act?PINTAMALLI: Section 3ZL of the Crimes Act your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Of the Crimes Act?PINTAMALLI: Yes.28. Under s 3ZL of the Crimes Act 1914 I order that Mr Tolentino provide identification to the authorities either by fingerprints or photographs.PINTAMALLI: And your Honour can direct that he go to a particular police station within x amount of time in order to get those.29. For that purpose, he is to attend Blacktown Police Station on or before Friday 20 November 2009.HIS HONOUR: Now are there any other formalities I need to attend to?PINTAMALLI: No your Honour.HAMPEL: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Ms Hampel?HAMPEL: No.HIS HONOUR: Okay. 30. Mr Tolentino, you stand up now. You have got a sentence of imprisonment of two years, but I have directed that you be released upon your promising to be of good behaviour for the next two years and that you be supervised by Probation and Parole, and that you follow their directions and recommendations about your drug taking and getting psychological help to assist you with the issues in your past. Do you understand that?OFFENDER: I do.31. All right. If you breach the good behaviour order, for example, if you are found to be taking drugs again, then you will be brought back before me and you are likely to go to gaol. Do you understand that?OFFENDER: I do.32. You’ve committed serious crimes. I have described the reasons I have decided not to send you to gaol. You have a strong family, in particular your fiancée is backing you in these circumstances. This is your opportunity to stop this problem with your life to do with drugs. You must do that or you will be back before me or another judge on more serious crimes I expect. You are vulnerable because of your drug taking, you must get rid of that from your life, get back to normal with your family and get your life back on track. If you don’t, you will be even in more serious trouble, you will lose your family because you will be in gaol. Do you understand that? You must take this opportunity. Probation and Parole will help you. They are trained, they are trained to help people like you who have a drug problem, who have personal issues, they know what they are doing. You obviously have issues in your past which you need help with. If you get the right help, things will be a lot easier for you, you’ll be surprised. So let them help you, it will make life a lot easier, do you understand?OFFENDER: Yes I do.HIS HONOUR: All right, good luck. Okay, anything else that I need to do?HAMPEL: No your Honour.PINTAMALLI: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right.

   1 At the Sutherland Local Court, the appellant was convicted of the offence of negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm contrary to s 42 (1) (b) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. The appellant appealed.The Accident2 At 2:40 p.m. on Sunday 28 October 2007, the appellant was driving his white station wagon out of the driveway of a unit block in Elouera Road, Cronulla. He visited the units frequently and was familiar with the surrounding traffic conditions. Elouera Road runs north/south. As he exited the driveway, the appellant’s vehicle was facing east. The appellant intended to cross the northbound lane of Elouera Road and turn right into the southbound lane. The traffic was moderate. The appellant stopped his vehicle in the gutter and waited for the traffic to clear. The driveway was about 95 m north of the intersection of Elouera Road and the Kingsway. The North Cronulla Hotel was located between the Kingsway and the unit driveway. Parked vehicles obstructed the appellant's view to the right, towards the Kingsway. When he thought that the northbound lane was clear, he proceeded to move across it. 3 The intersection of Elouera Road and the Kingsway was controlled by traffic lights. When the lights turned green, a motorbike was the first vehicle through the lights. It turned left (north) into Elouera Road, passed the driveway to the North Cronulla Hotel, and accelerated ""moderately harshly"" to reach a speed in excess of the 50 km per hour speed limit.4 When his vehicle was well into the northbound lane, the appellant saw the motorbike proceeding towards his vehicle at speed. The motorbike was 25 to 30 m away. The motorbike braked. When it was about 20 m from the appellant's vehicle, the motorbike skidded. It collided with a point on the appellant's vehicle that was about two thirds of the way between the front and rear of the driver's door. 5 The motorbike rider sustained a complete C5 spinal cord injury resulting in tetraplegia and associated disabilities.The Issues6 The issues before the Local Court and on appeal were: 
     
      
      1.The speed of the motorbike.  
       
      2. Whether the appellant negligently failed to keep a proper lookout.  
       
      3. Whether the injuries sustained by the motorbike rider may have been attributable to the excessive speed at which he was riding rather than to the appellant’s negligence. 
      
    The Speed of the Motorbike7 Except to the extent that it may have impacted upon the appellant’s conduct and the assessment of whether his conduct was negligent, in these proceedings the Court is not concerned to identify fault on the part of the motorbike rider. Although the nexus was not clearly articulated, the appellant did assert that the speed of the motorbike affected an assessment of whether the appellant's conduct was negligent.8 Mr Reeves, an off-duty police officer who was crossing Elouera Road at the Kingsway at the time of the accident, estimated that the motorbike accelerated to a speed between 60 and 70 kph. Mr Moullet, an eyewitness with eight years experience as a motorbike rider, estimated the speed at between 50 and 70 kph. Mr Barsch, who witnessed the incident from the North Cronulla Hotel, estimated the speed at 70 to 80 kph. Mr Lennon, an expert called by the prosecution (over objection to his qualifications) used North Cronulla Hotel CCTV footage to calculate that, when it was approximately 75 m north of the appellant, the motorbike may have been travelling at 64 kph. I infer that the motorbike may have accelerated past that point.9 Mr Sculthorpe, the expert called by the appellant, opined that the motorbike was travelling at 92 kph when the motorbike rider applied the brakes and that it was travelling at 82 kph on impact. As noted by the Local Court (para 58 of the reasons for decision), Mr Sculthorpe's opinion was based on a conclusion that the appellant's vehicle moved sideways on impact. That conclusion depended on the interpretation of marks on the road as depicted in photographs, and battery acid marks that Mr Sculthorpe observed on the roadway in December 2008. Mr Sculthorpe did not inspect the appellant’s vehicle and was therefore unable to give reliable evidence about the aetiology of battery acid leakage from the vehicle. I agree with the Local Court that an opinion based on such matters is unreliable. 10 I accept the evidence of Mr Reeves that the motorbike was travelling at up to about 70 kph, well in excess of the speed limit of 50 kph. Mr Reeves was an experienced police officer. His evidence was consistent with that of other eyewitnesses and Mr Lennon.11 Had the motorbike travelled at an average speed of 60 - 70 kph over the 95 m from the corner to the point of impact, it would have covered the distance in 5 – 6 seconds (at 16 to 19 m per second). Even an average speed of 90 kph (very fast, as the motorbike had been stationary at the traffic lights and braked before impact), it would have taken 3.6 seconds to travel from the corner to the point of impact (at 25 m per second). The Appellant’s Negligence12 The issue is whether the appellant exercised that degree of care which the ordinary prudent driver would have exercised in all the circumstances, including the circumstances set out in s 42 (3): DPP v Yeo [2008] NSWSC 953, approving Simpson v Peat [1952] 2 QB 24.13 Section 42 (3) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        ""42 (3) In considering whether an offence has been committed under this section, the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following: 
         
        (a) the nature, condition and use of the road or road related area on which the offence is alleged to have been committed, 
         
        (b) the amount of traffic that actually is at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road or road related area.” 
        
       
      
    14 At the time of the accident, it was a sunny Sunday afternoon. Elouera Road was in apparently good condition. The traffic volume was substantial or “busy”. On the western side of Elouera Road, to the appellant's right and between his vehicle and the Kingsway, were three parked cars, then the driveway servicing the North Cronulla Hotel car park. There were three or four large palm trees with thick trunks and several other trees (see the photographs and Exhibit 10).15 In evidence, the appellant said that he had a “clear line of sight up to the traffic lights"" and had ""made sure"" that the northbound lane was clear before he drove into the lane. He said that, when the front wheels of his vehicle were in the gutter, he had a clear view through the windows of the parked cars. More realistically, in an electronically recorded interview, the appellant said that his view was ""filtered"" and that obstruction by parked cars had ""always been an issue"" when exiting the driveway to the units.16 Although incomplete, the CCTV footage recorded by two cameras at the North Cronulla Hotel provided useful information as to the timing of events. A master control ensured synchronisation of the times on each of the two cameras. In para 6, figure 1 of its reasons, the Local Court set out a helpful summary of the camera - recorded events, which is partially reproduced and supplemented by comments below.

       14.40.47 
       Collision has occurred, the motorbike is under the front of the car and appellant starts to open driver’s door. Front of appellant’s bonnet is at painted median strip. 
        
       
      
    17 Having regard to the CCTV evidence, I find that, at 14.40.41, a 4-wheel drive vehicle passed in front of the appellant's car, leaving the northbound lane clear apart from the motorbike. The appellant checked for oncoming traffic, but did not see the motorbike because his view was obstructed by parked vehicles. At that point, the motorbike was approximately 70 m (3.6 seconds at 70kph, 2.8 seconds at 90 kph) from the appellant's vehicle. At 14.40.42, the appellant nudged his vehicle forward.18 At 14.40.43 the appellant’s bonnet moved just beyond the line of parked cars, affording a better - but not entirely clear - view of oncoming northbound traffic. Had the appellant's vehicle remained in that position or moved slightly forward to check for northbound traffic, there would have been ample opportunity for the motorbike to pass. However, the appellant moved his vehicle forward so that the front of the bonnet was at or very near the painted median strip, entirely blocking the northbound lane. When the appellant and the motorbike rider saw each other, the distance between their vehicles was only 25 to 30 m (at most, two seconds of travel time for the motorbike). The appellant observed that the motorbike ""didn't have much hope of stopping before he collided with me"" (ERISP, question and answer 9).19 The appellant's conduct was understandable. He probably had an adequate view of northbound cars and he may have failed to consider the possibility of motorbikes. Given the busy traffic, he may have been anxious to move forward during an apparent break in the traffic. However, a prudent driver would have adverted to the possibility of motorbike traffic and would have appreciated that his or her view of motorbike traffic was obstructed. A prudent driver would have moved forward more slowly, would have observed the oncoming motorbike well before the bonnet of his or her vehicle reached the painted median strip and would have stopped the vehicle to allow the motorbike to pass. The appellant was negligent.The Cause of the Injuries20 At least in part, the injuries sustained by the motorbike rider were attributable to the appellant’s negligence. Had the appellant seen the motorbike earlier and halted his vehicle only part way into the northbound lane, the motorbike could have avoided the vehicle, either by proceeding straight ahead or by deviating only slightly to the right.21 The appeal against conviction is dismissed.

     CICCIARELLO v REGINA 
     
     
     HEADNOTE 
      
    Mr Cicciarello pleaded guilty to two charges, namely supplying not less that a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine based on Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), s25(2) and possession of an unlicensed firearm based on Firearms Act 1996 (NSW), s7A(1).The sentencing judge assessed the seriousness of the drug supply offence as within the midrange of objective seriousness taking into account that the crime was committed for “financial gain” and that the offence involved a series of criminal acts. Mr Cicciarello was sentenced to a total term of seven and a half years with a non-parole period of five years, being comprised of seven years for the drug supply offence and one year for the firearms offence, accumulated by six months. The applicant sought leave to appeal from the sentences imposed.The appeal grounds against sentence included: 
     
     1. the sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the drug supply offence; 
      
     2. the sentencing judge erred in finding that an aggravating factor to be taken into account was that the drug supply offence was committed for financial gain;  
      
     3. the sentencing judge erred in finding that an aggravating factor to be taken into account was that the offence comprised a series of criminal acts.  
    Held granting leave to appeal against sentence, allowing the appeal, quashing the sentence below and re-sentencing the applicant:The Court (Allsop P, Fullerton J and McCallum J) 
     
     1. There was evidence before the sentencing judge which His Honour accepted that the proceeds of the supply were used to fund the applicant’s own drug addiction and therefore it was an error to characterise the circumstances of supply as selling for financial gain: [13] – [17]. 
      
      
     2. When the series of criminal acts leads to the more serious criminal charge being laid against the applicant, the prohibition against double counting is undermined if the same series of criminal acts is taken into account as an additional aggravating factor, in turn leading to an erroneous characterisation of the offence as one in the midrange of seriousness: [19].  
     
     
     3. Given the above errors it was an error to characterise the offence under the  
     Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
      as falling in the mid-range of objective seriousness and a less severe sentence was warranted in law:[20] – [21].

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: The applicant seeks an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal and leave to appeal from sentences imposed on him by a judge of the District Court (Sorby DCJ) on 22 August 2008 in respect of two offences to which he pleaded guilty. Those offences were: 
     
      
       
      1. Between 27 February 2007 and 12 April 2007 he supplied not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. 
       
       
      2. On 12 April 2007 he possessed an unlicensed firearm. 
       
      
    2 The former charge was based on the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), s 25(2) for which the maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period is 10 years. The latter charge was based on the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW), s 7A(1) for which the maximum penalty is five years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 On a Form 1 there was one charge of possession of ammunition without holding a licence or permit or authority pursuant to the Firearms Act, s 65(3). 
     
      
    4 The applicant was sentenced to a total term of seven and a half years with a non-parole period of five years. With respect to the first charge, the drug offence, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of four and a half years commencing on 12 October 2007 and concluding on 11 April 2012, with a balance of term of two and a half years concluding on 11 October 2014. With respect to the second charge, the firearm offence, he was sentenced to a fixed term of one year to date from 12 April 2007 and concluding on 11 April 2008. Thus, the two offences were accumulated by six months. 
     
      
    5 There was an agreed statement of facts before the sentencing judge from which the following facts were derived. On 1 February 2007, Redfern Police commenced an investigation and operation into the alleged supply of commercial quantities of prohibited drugs including crystal methylamphetamine or “Ice” by the applicant from his premises in Surry Hills. On 14 February 2007, in a controlled operation, an undercover policeman was authorised to purchase prohibited drugs from the applicant. On 20 February 2007, a warrant was granted by the Supreme Court to monitor and record conversations of the applicant and the undercover officer.  
     
      
    6 The facts of the first offence, being the supply of not less than a commercial quantity (390.31 grams) of methylamphetamine were as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. On Tuesday 27 February 2007, the undercover officer contacted the applicant at various times on a mobile phone and arranged the purchase of “eight ball” of Ice for $1,100. The applicant agreed and arranged for the undercover officer to attend the premises. He did attend and the applicant supplied him with 3.47 grams of Ice. This is in excess of three grams which is a trafficable quantity under the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
      .  
       
       
      2. On Thursday 1 March 2007, (two days later) the undercover officer contacted the applicant again at various times on a mobile phone and arranged the purchase of a quantity of Ice for $2,200 dollars. The applicant agreed and arranged for the undercover officer to attend the premises. He did attend and the applicant supplied him with 6.93 grams of Ice. 
       
       
      3. On Friday 9 March 2007, the undercover police officer again contacted the applicant at various times on a mobile phone and arranged to purchase a further quantity of Ice for $4,000. The applicant agreed and arranged to meet the officer at Mutch Park in Pagewood. The undercover officer drove there, met the applicant who supplied him with 13.9 grams of ice. 
       
       
      4. Between 16 March 2007 and 11 April 2007, a mobile telephone number belonging to the applicant was the subject of lawful interception and calls were intercepted containing both open and coded conversations relating to the supply of Ice. The transcripts of 14 of those calls were before the Court. They revealed a number of agreements to supply Ice under the extended definition of supply in the  
      Drug Misuse and 
        
      Trafficking Act 
      , s 3. 
       
       
      5. Of the 390.31 grams the subject of count one, 24.30 grams were supplied to the undercover officer and the balance the subject of agreements to supply. 
        
       
      
    7 The facts of the second offence, being the firearm offence, were that on Thursday 12 April 2007 police attended the applicant’s premises with a search warrant. Upon announcing their presence, the police heard footsteps within the premises, forced the door open and entered the premises. They observed the applicant climbing over a wall into the neighbouring premises. After a struggle the applicant was arrested and escorted back inside. He was wearing a “bum bag”, a search of which revealed a Colt .38 calibre automatic pistol containing a magazine with six rounds of ammunition, though no round of the ammunition was chambered. 
     
      
    8 The remarks on sentence by the sentencing judge were summarised by the Crown on the application as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) Both offences were objectively serious and general deterrence and specific deterrence must play an important part in the sentencing exercise. 
       
       
      (b) The applicant’s attempts at rehabilitation so far and his determination to do more were accepted by the sentencing judge as special circumstances to allow him to vary the statutory ratio of non-parole to parole periods. 
       
       
      (c) The applicant was entitled to a 25 per cent discount for his pleas. 
       
       
      (d) The applicant had relatively minor criminal history with no similar offence. 
       
       
      (e) This is the applicant’s first experience of full-time custody which was to be taken into account as another special circumstance. 
       
       
      (f) The applicant was unlikely to reoffend. 
       
       
      (g) The offences were not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. 
       
       
      (h) The offence under s 25(2) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
      involved a series of criminal acts and was committed for financial gain.* 
       
       
      (i) The firearm offence was committed without regard to public safety, there being live ammunition in the firearm and the applicant was carrying the weapon. 
       
       
      (j) The drug offence falls into the mid-range of objective seriousness.* 
       
      
    9 The two subparagraphs marked with asterisks were said by the applicant to contain material error.10 The applicant raised initially six grounds of appeal. Grounds 4 and 6 were not pressed. Only grounds 1, 2 and 3 need be dealt with. 
     
      
    11 Grounds 1 and 2 were central to the application and appeal by the applicant. They were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ground 1. The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the drug supply offence. 
         
         
        Ground 2. The sentencing judge erred in finding that an aggravating factor to be taken into account was that the drug supply offence was committed for financial gain.” 
        
       
      
    12 The applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. His evidence was clear that he sold the drugs and agreed to sell drugs to support his addiction to Ice. That addiction had begun after the break-up of his marriage. While he was in the personal difficulties he found himself under, he began seeing escorts or prostitutes who introduced him to the drug Ice. He testified that he was not making any profits from his supply in the sense that all the proceeds went into obtaining drugs for his own use. When the Crown Prosecutor began to investigate this in questioning, the sentencing judge indicated that he did not want any further information. It appears from the whole of the transcript that the sentencing judge accepted the applicant’s claim that all the proceeds of his supplies went to support his own drug habit. This very proposition was submitted to the sentencing judge by counsel for the applicant to which the sentencing judge replied: “have to be, yes”. 
     
      
    13 In Day (1998) 100 A Crim R 275 at 277 Wood CJ at CL said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The objective criminality of an offender who traffics in drugs to feed a personal habit is somewhat less than that of a trafficker for greed …” 
        
       
      
    14 In Way [2004] NSWCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at 186-187 [86] Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Some of the relevant circumstances which can be said ‘objectively’ to affect the ‘seriousness’ of the offence will be personal to the offender at the time of the offence but become relevant because of their causal connection with its commission. This would extend to matters of motivation ( 
        for example 
         duress, provocation,  
        robbery to feed a drug addiction 
        ) …” 
        
       
       (emphasis added) 
      
    15 In Bowden [2009] NSWCCA 45 at [55]-[60] a distinction was drawn between selling drugs for commercial gain and for feeding a habit.16 Notwithstanding the material that was before him which he apparently accepted the learned sentencing judge assessed the seriousness of the offence as within the mid-range of objective seriousness taking into account that the crime was committed for “financial gain”. 
     
      
    17 Whilst one should be careful about generalising in relation to such factors outside the circumstances of any particular case, here, quite clearly, when one understands the background of this young man and what he was doing, he was not selling for greed or for financial gain, he was selling to feed a drug habit that he had acquired. This does not detract from the fact that he committed a serious offence, but what it does mean is that it was an error, and an important one, to characterise this as selling for financial gain and thus to characterise it as an offence falling within the mid-range. In our view, that latter conclusion must clearly have been affected by the finding of financial gain because no other basis in the facts could found such a conclusion. 
     
      
    18 In our view, there was an error of the sentencing judge in this regard. This error led to his Honour characterising the objective criminality of the offence as more serious than it was. It was not within the mid-range of objective seriousness. It was lower than that, in particular given that it was to feed his habit. A less severe sentence was warranted in law: the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3). For this reason the sentence on the first charge should be quashed. 
     
      
    19 Ground 3 concerned the way the sentencing judge took into account as an aggravating factor the fact that there was a series of criminal acts: the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act (1999) (NSW), s 21A(2)(m). The difficulty with this is that those multiple criminal acts were the foundation for the more serious offence with which he was charged, namely supply of not less than a commercial quantity of the drug for which a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment was provided. They were not strictly elements of the offence charged, as for example they would have been in an offence of on-going supply under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, s 25A. In such a case, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 21A would expressly prohibit a sentencing court from having additional regard to such matters as an aggravating factor. The risk of double counting in the assessment of objective seriousness in that case would thereby be avoided. Here, when the series of criminal acts leads to the more serious criminal charge being properly laid against the applicant, the prohibition against double counting is undermined if the same series of criminal acts is taken into account as an additional aggravating factor, in turn leading to an erroneous characterisation of the offence as one of mid-range seriousness. The above is consistent with Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145; 65 NSWLR 740 at 747 [29].20 In these circumstances, in our view, the sentence on the first charge affected as it is by these errors should be quashed and a less severe sentence imposed. No complaint was made about the sentence for the second offence. Nevertheless, for clarity, simplicity and the sake of good order we would quash both sentences and resentence the applicant for both offences. 
     
      
    21 In resentencing the applicant, we would take into account all the other matters legitimately, if we may respectfully say so, taken into account by the sentencing judge which we need not repeat. Counsel for the applicant put to the Court that an appropriate sentence on the first charge would be that suggested by counsel for the applicant below. Adopting that course, counsel for the applicant suggested that a non-parole period of three years with six months accumulation for the sentence for the firearms offence (being a fixed term of one year) would be appropriate. The Crown on appeal did not contest this approach, if it be found by this Court (as it has been) that a less severe sentence was warranted in law. In our view, the sentence suggested by counsel for the applicant at the sentencing hearing and adopted by his counsel in this Court is the appropriate sentence reflecting the objective criminality of the offence. The balance of term should be adjusted accordingly. 
     
      
    22 An extension of time for leave to appeal is required. No submission was put against that by the Crown. Therefore, the orders that we would make are: 
     
      
       
      1. Extend time for the applicant to give notice of intention to appeal or to give notice of intention to apply for leave to appeal to 2 July 2009. 
       
       
      2. Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      3. Allow the appeal. 
       
       
      4. Quash the sentences imposed on the applicant by 
        
      Sorby DCJ in the District Court on 22 August 2008 and in lieu thereof: 
       
       
        
        (a) As to count one, imprisonment for a non-parole period of three years commencing on 12 October 2007 and concluding on 11 October 2010; balance of term of one and a half years commencing on 12 October 2010 and concluding on 11 April 2012. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) As to count two, imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months commencing 12 April 2007 and expiring 11 April 2008.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ AT CL: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: These two applications for leave to appeal are connected in that both applicants were sentenced for the same offence of robbery in company committed on 10 November 2006. Sides DCJ sentenced the applicant England on 19 May 2008 and King DCJ sentenced the applicant Phanith on 24 October 2008. In respect of this robbery both applicants asked that matters be taken into account on a Form 1. In addition Sides DCJ sentenced the applicant England for another offence of robbery in company committed on 17 November 2006. In sentencing her for that offence the Judge was asked to take into account matters on a further Form 1. In addition the applicant England was sentenced for two offences of aggravated break and enter for which she had previously been placed on bonds. There were also three matters dealt with under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act. 
     
      
    3 Each of the robbery offences was contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act for which a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment is prescribed. In respect of the applicant England, the aggravated break and enter with intent offence carried a maximum penalty of 14 years while the aggravated break enter and steal offence carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years. 
     
      
    4 The applicant Phanith was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months dating from 10 April 2007 with a parole period of 18 months. He is eligible for release to parole on 9 October 2011. 
     
      
    5 The applicant England was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 8 years 6 months with an overall non-parole period of 4 years 6 months dating from 15 November 2006. She is eligible to be released to parole on 14 May 2011. 
     
      
       
      The application by Phanith 
      
    6 It is convenient to deal with the applicant Phanith first. He needs to be granted an extension of time in which to apply for leave. Although the reasons to explain the delay are hardly impressive, in light of the relatively short period of delay and the length of the sentence I believe that an extension of time should be granted. 
     
      
       
        
        Robbery of 10 November 
        
       
      
    7 The facts can be briefly stated. For convenience I shall use the last name of the two applicants without intending any disrespect to them. Phanith and England were in a relationship at the time of the offence. At about 8pm on 10 November 2006, Sareth Sor (the victim) was at his family home in Rosemeadow. His parents were inside the premises with him and his girlfriend, Leah Johnson, was outside the house smoking a cigarette. Phanith approached Ms Johnson, whom he knew, and asked to speak to the victim. She replied that he was sleeping. At this point two co-offenders, named Tran and Bobby, approached the house through the carport. Ms Johnson, who did not know these two men, told them they could not go inside. 
     
      
    8 Tran pushed Ms Johnson aside and, opening the sliding door, went inside with Bobby. Ms Johnson also went inside, followed by Phanith. The three males went into the victim’s bedroom, punched him and demanded money. Hearing loud noises, the victim’s mother left her bedroom and saw what was happening in her son’s room. The three men pushed the victim out of the bedroom and into the hallway. 
     
      
    9 Tran went to the kitchen, obtained a small metal “shifter” and a knife. He approached the victim and struck him on the head with the “shifter”. The victim fell to the floor, and his mother lay on top of him to protect him. Johnson pleaded with Tran to stop hitting the victim, but she was punched to the left side of her face.  
     
      
    10 While this was occurring in the hallway, England was in the living room. Tran demanded that the victim and his parents give them all their money, the jewellery they were wearing and hand over their keycards and car keys. The mother removed her gold necklace, which Tran seized. While this was occurring, Bobby was ransacking cupboards in the mother’s room. He took six mobile phones and a purse belonging to the mother.  
     
      
    11 The three men took the family members into the victim’s bedroom. Tran instructed Phanith to tie them up. Having bound Johnson’s hands and ankles with masking or duct tape, Phanith handed the tape to the victim and demanded that he tie up his family. However, Tran returned, snatched the tape from him and bound the hands and ankles of the parents. He also put tape over their mouths. He tied the victim’s wrists with the tape and then ransacked his bedroom. 
     
      
    12 England meanwhile went into the bedrooms of the victim and his mother and returned carrying two bags apparently full of stolen property. Phanith carried a bag containing a Sony mini system and speakers out of the victim’s room. All four offenders moved about the house, taking property that they then put into a motor vehicle belonging to the victim’s mother. 
     
      
    13 A number of pieces of jewellery, electrical items, mobile phones, cash, a handbag containing keycards and other personal items, and two mini bikes were stolen. During this time Tran came into the bedroom where the victims were bound. He was armed with a knife and demanded the PIN number for the keycards stolen from the mother. He threatened that, if they were not the correct numbers, he was going to kill her. She wrote the numbers down on a piece of paper. Tran told her that he knew where she lived and threatened to return to kill her and burn the house down if she rang the police.  
     
      
    14 Phanith said to Johnson, “My girlfriend Crystal is coming”. England came into the bedroom and said, “I’m sorry, I didn’t want this to happen but it had to happen”. Shortly after this conversation, Bobby took Johnson’s concession card, and said, “I know where you live”.  
     
      
    15 The offenders remained in the house for about forty minutes before taking the car keys and leaving in the mother’s motor vehicle. The victim and his parents eventually freed themselves and went to a relative’s house where they called the police. The victim and Johnson recognised both England and Phanith, whom they had previously met. 
     
      
       
        
        Form 1 matters 
        
       
      
    16 There were seven matters placed on a Form 1. They included four offences contrary to s 86(2)(a) of the Crimes Act of detaining the four persons who were the victims of the robbery offence. There were two offences of break, enter and stealing, one committed on 7 January 2005 and the other on 21 November 2006. There was an offence of attempting to escape police custody arising from his arrest on the robbery matter. It should be noted that each of the detention offences would have carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment had the applicant been sentenced for those matters. There needed to be a significant increase in the sentence for the robbery to reflect such serious matters on the Form 1, especially as the two break and enter offences also being taken into account were unrelated criminality. 
     
      
       
        
        Subjective factors 
        
       
      
    17 The applicant was born on 10 October 1982. He was on parole at the time of the commission of the offence. He was released from custody on 21 September 2006. He failed to report to the Probation and Parole Service as required on 21 November 2006. This failure was one of the reasons his parole was ultimately revoked. He served the balance of his sentence until 27 August 2007 and thereafter was on remand for the offences for which he was sentenced. 
     
      
    18 The applicant has a criminal record dating from 1999 for numerous offences of dishonesty including break and enter offences and stealing from the person. He has served a number of periods in custody. His last sentence was a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 18 months with a balance of term of 7 months for using an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension. 
     
      
    19 There was a pre-sentence report in evidence that indicated that, over the history of his criminal record, most community-based orders had been revoked and replaced with custodial sentences as a result of the applicant re-offending by the commission of drug and drug-related offences. There is little in his background of relevance apart from his continued use of prohibited drugs since the age of 15. He has failed in all attempts at rehabilitation. He has been treated as an escape risk while in custody, however, he has been involved in a methadone maintenance programme. He takes medication for depression. The only subjective matter significantly in his favour is his supportive family. 
     
      
    20 There was a psychological report that suggests that the applicant may have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the death of a schoolmate. Although there were expressions of remorse contained in the report, the account given by the applicant to the psychologist was inconsistent with the agreed facts and in effect the applicant denied involvement in a planned robbery. The report suggested that the applicant showed impaired judgment as a result of the use of drugs to relieve his depression, anxiety and his PTSD. 
     
      
       
        
        Grounds of appeal 
        
       
      
    21 The grounds relied upon by the applicant are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The Applicant was left with a justifiable sense of grievance so far as the sentence imposed upon his Co-offender is concerned. 
         
         
        2. His Honour the sentencing Judge made findings of fact which were not open upon the evidence. 
         
         
        3. His Honour the sentencing Judge erred when he found that the objective seriousness of the offence committed by the Applicant was increased by reason of the use of corporal violence by a co-offender. 
         
        
       
      
    22 It is appropriate to deal with the second and third grounds of appeal first as a ground concerned only with the issue of parity assumes that the sentence is otherwise appropriate. If the Court concludes that there is error, it will take into account the issue of parity in deciding whether some other sentence is warranted.  
     
      
    23 The second ground of appeal complains of the following finding by the sentencing judge: 
     
      
       
        
         
         A conclusion can also be drawn beyond reasonable doubt that prior to entry, as part of the contemplated joint criminal enterprise, the offender considered and agreed to the use of a high level of intimidation by threat of violence, to ensure the victims would surrender property. 
        
       
      
    24 The full passage in the sentencing remarks in which this passage occurs is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The offender had known [the victim] since their schooldays and continuing to the date of the offence. The female co-offender similarly knew [the victim], but neither of the other two male co-offenders did. The Court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was the first to approach the house and did so in order to ensure that easy access could be obtained for all of the offenders. 
         
         
        A conclusion can also be drawn beyond reasonable doubt that prior to entry, as part of the contemplated joint criminal enterprise, the offender considered and agreed to the use of a high level of intimidation by threat or violence, to ensure that the victims would surrender property, including a bankcard and the relevant PIN number and be dissuaded from reporting the offence to the police. The offender was well known to the victim [ ] and Leah Johnson. He was readily identifiable to the other victims from the duration of the time spent in the house and in particular from his distinctive tattoos, “one life” and “one chance” on each arm. As the offender was on parole at the time and could so readily be identified to the police, he must have contemplated and agreed to a high level of intimidation by threat or violence to ensure he was not reported to the police for the offence. 
        
       
      
    25 I can see nothing wrong with this reasoning and I am unpersuaded that it was not open to his Honour to make the finding that he did, even beyond reasonable doubt. Further, it is clear that the applicant never raised any objection to the use of violence by the other men and did not desist from his involvement in the robbery when that violence occurred. Rather he continued to assist the co-offenders in carrying out the robbery. His Honour referred to these additional facts later in his remarks as further evidence justifying his finding that the applicant contemplated that violence or threats of intimidation would occur once they entered the house. In any event, it would not have been a matter of great significance in my opinion whether or not the applicant contemplated the possibility of violence or threats before he entered the premises in light of the fact that he clearly continued with the robbery notwithstanding the violence that had taken place in his presence. Further, when people embark upon a robbery in premises where it is known that there are a number of people present, I find it impossible to understand how at least the possibility of violence of some form was not contemplated by all of the participants in the robbery. This ground fails. 
     
      
    26 The third ground of appeal complains that the Judge took into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence the fact that a co-offender used corporal violence on the victim. In light of my rejection of the second ground of appeal, this complaint has no merit. If it were in his contemplation that a co-offender might use actual violence in the course of the robbery, it was a matter aggravating the objective seriousness of the offence that such violence was in fact used, whether it involved a weapon or not. 
     
      
    27 The second and third grounds of appeal in my view confuse the task of finding facts for the purpose of sentencing and the task of finding facts for the purpose of extending criminal liability for a different offence committed during the course of a joint criminal enterprise. In the present case it must have been well within the contemplation of the offender that there was the possibility that physical violence would occur. I do not think that it is of major significance for the purpose of sentencing whether that violence occurs with or without the use of a weapon. That distinction might be an important one if, for example, the victim had died by the use of a weapon. Then the issue would be whether the applicant should be found legally responsible for the killing. But in any event the applicant made no complaint to his co-offender about the use of the weapon, he took no steps to protect the victim and he did not withdraw from the enterprise after the weapon was used. In those circumstances I cannot see why he should not be sentenced on the basis that a weapon was used during the course of the robbery. This ground also fails. 
     
      
    28 In my opinion the sentence imposed was well within the sentencing judge’s discretion. There is a complaint that the sentence was at the very top of the range contemplated by the guideline judgment in Henry. If the Henry guideline had any relevance, and I doubt that it was a significant consideration in determining the sentence, it was to indicate that this offence fell well outside the nature of the offending and the type of offender that was considered in the guideline. On almost every aspect of the factors considered in Henry this offence was more serious and the offender’s subjective circumstances less helpful to him. In light of his age and his criminal record, the applicant’s psychological problems and use of drugs had little mitigatory effect. 
     
      
    29 The matters on the Form 1 were serious and had to have a significant impact upon the ultimate sentence imposed. As against a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and in light of the seriousness of the conduct for which the applicant was before the Court, the sentence was in my opinion a lenient one. 
     
      
    30 The complaint on the basis of disparity arises from the fact that Judge Sides sentenced Ms England for this offence to a sentence of imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. Curiously the applicant England complains that she has a justifiable sense of grievance by reason of the sentence imposed upon the applicant by Judge King. 
     
      
    31 One of the major differences between the two sentences was that Ms England received a discount of 25 per cent and had a very favourable finding of special circumstances. The applicant received a discount of 15 per cent and no finding of special circumstances. Those two differences would not give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant about the difference in the sentences imposed upon him and the applicant England for this robbery offence. 
     
      
    32 I will say a little more about the task of this Court when considering a ground of appeal that asserts unacceptable disparity when dealing with the application by Ms England. It is enough to dispose of this ground of appeal to indicate that I am unpersuaded that there were such differences between the two applicants in either their criminality or their subjective circumstances that there is any basis for a justifiable sense of grievance to be held by the applicant. In any event this Court’s power to intervene to correct apparent disparity is a matter of discretion. I would not reduce the sentence imposed upon the applicant, which, as I have indicated, is a lenient one. 
     
      
    33 I propose the following orders: the extension of time to apply for leave to appeal is granted, leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed. 
     
      
       
      The applicant England 
       
        
        Robbery of 17 November 
        
       
      
    34 At about 4am on 18 November 2006, the victim, her two children and a male friend were sleeping in a unit at Liverpool. The victim was awoken by the sound of the security door intercom. She used the intercom to ask who was at the door. The applicant replied: “It is Crystal, I just want to talk to you.” The two women had met about two weeks earlier. 
     
      
    35 The victim allowed the applicant to enter the unit. As she went to close the door, three men forced their way inside. When the victim asked the applicant what was wrong, she shook her head. One of the men grabbed the victim by the arm, pulled her away from the door and told her to get down on the floor. She begged them not to injure her children. The same male offender demanded money. She told him the only money in the unit was in her purse. The men tied her hands. She said to the applicant: “I know you are part of this.” The applicant denied that she was. 
     
      
    36 At the same time another man, who wore a balaclava, grabbed the male friend around the throat as he left the bathroom and threw him to the ground. With the assistance of another man, they tied his hands and legs. He was kicked once in the head, after being told to keep his head down, and he was searched for money. 
     
      
    37 The men brought the two children into the lounge room and sat them down next to the applicant, who had also been tied up to give the impression that she was not a party to the offence. The three men ransacked each room in searching for money and other property. As they did so they demanded money. One of the men tied the victim’s legs with a video cord. He told her to shut up, and hit her with a cushion. He threatened her that she would be raped and he placed a pillowslip over her head. 
     
      
    38 Before leaving, the men told the victim that they were taking the applicant as hostage and would kill her if anything happened. She replied: “You are taking her because she is part of it.” She watched the assailants fill a blue sports bag with an Xbox, two mobile phones, jewellery, a wallet containing a small sum of money, personal cards and a set of house keys. After they left, the victim and the male freed themselves and he ran across the road to a public phone box and telephoned the police.  
     
      
       
        
        Form 1 matters 
        
       
      
    39 In respect of the robbery of 10 November the applicant asked that four matters be taken into account; three offences of detaining contrary to s 86(2)(a) of the Crimes Act and a negligent driving. In respect of the robbery of 17 November the applicant asked that four matters be taken into account being an offence of detaining, an offence of supplying methadone, an offence of possessing a prescribed substance and an aggravated break and steal offence. This last offence involved the theft of a large amount of jewellery valued at almost $40,000 on 21 October 2006. 
     
      
       
        
        Breaches of bonds 
        
       
      
    40 The applicant was sentenced on 4 October 2006 for two offences concerning the breaking and entering of commercial premises. She was in the company with her then boyfriend. Judge Goldring found that she had a minor involvement in the offences. His Honour had before him a psychiatric report and noted that the applicant had mental health problems. Her mother gave evidence that there had been a change in her behaviour. The Judge having regard to the length of time since the commission of the offences determined to place her on bonds. He noted that she was not going to be supervised but suggested that she seek help from a psychologist or mental health team. 
     
      
       
        
        Subjective circumstances 
        
       
      
    41 The applicant was born on 10 July 1979. She has a criminal record dating back to 1998 for offences of dishonesty including break and enter offences. She served short terms of imprisonment in 2000. In 2004 she received suspended sentences for offences of receiving with a condition of the associated bond that she place herself under supervision with drug counselling. All offences up to this stage in her record had been dealt with in the Local Court. As I have already noted, she was placed on bonds in the District Court in 2006. 
     
      
    42 There was a pre-sentence report in which it is noted that the applicant is a single mother of two children. She has been in a number of relationships all of which have involved the use of drugs. The applicant stated that she had used illicit drugs since leaving school and all of her associates use drugs. The report contains the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [The applicant] appears to have matured during the remand period and presents as ashamed and disgusted by the results of her drug lifestyle. It would seem that the offender has demonstrated some change in both attitude and willingness to address her drug addiction and provide for herself a better foundation for the future since undertaking courses in custody and by applying to rehabilitation facilities. 
        
       
      
    43 There was a report of a psychologist. It contains a detailed account of her background. Her father was of the Aboriginal race and an alcoholic. Her parents’ relationship was subject to domestic violence and they separated when the applicant was aged 12. She maintains a strong relationship with her mother who visits her in gaol frequently. The applicant reported abusing alcohol and drugs from the time her parents separated. She has a lengthy psychiatric history involving anxiety and depression. At the age of 21 she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She has taken a variety of medications over the years and was at the time of the report taking Zyprexa. She was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2005. She was on a methadone course while in custody. The psychological test showed that she had an IQ score in the Above Average range. 
     
      
    44 The applicant gave evidence before Judge Sides. She stated that she had completed a number of courses in custody in order to better herself. She hoped to go to live with her mother on release at Watanobbi in the Central Coast in an attempt to break from her drug associates. She had made enquiries about rehabilitation programmes. Her mother also gave evidence and stated that she had noticed a change in her daughter over the period she had been on remand. She indicated a willingness to assist her daughter when she was released from custody. 
     
      
       
        
        The grounds of appeal 
        
       
      
    45 The following grounds of appeal were relied upon by the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance when considering the sentence imposed upon the co-accused, Simon Phanith, in relation to the robbery on 10 November 2006 (Count 1). 
         
         
        2. The individual sentences and the effective sentence are manifestly excessive given the applicant’s role in the offences, her remorse and her subjective case including her prospects of rehabilitation. 
         
        
       
      
    46 In relation to the second ground of appeal it was contended that the Judge had erred in deciding that her criminality for each offence was within the mid range of seriousness as it was below that range. It was submitted that the Judge ought to have given more significance to the applicant’s drug addiction as it had occurred at a very young age before she had the ability to exercise appropriate judgment, relying upon what Wood CJ at CL said in R v Henry (1999) 48 NSWLR 346 at [293]. 
     
      
    47 It was submitted that her role in the offences was consistent with the dynamics of her relationship described by the psychologist as being “characterized by servile behaviour” when the applicant allowed others “to exploit or mistreat her”. 
     
      
    48 It was submitted that the starting sentences before applying the discount for the pleas of guilty were manifestly excessive having regard to the statistics from the Judicial Commission. These, it was said, show that sentences for this offence range from 6 months to 12 years and in only 1 per cent of cases was a sentence of over 8 years imposed. 
     
      
    49 The statistics reveal once again that the sentences being imposed bear almost no relationship to the prescribed maximum penalty. Here the maximum was 20 years imprisonment yet the statistics reveal that, even having regard to consecutive sentences, the highest sentence imposed was 12 years imprisonment. A sentence of 5 years, that is a sentence amounting to a quarter of the maximum penalty, exceeded almost 75 per cent of the sentences imposed for this offence. Of 1583 sentences imposed, 62 per cent fell below 4 years, that is a fifth of the maximum penalty. 
     
      
    50 Each of the offences in which the applicant was involved was an offence towards the most serious type of offences for robbery in company. They were planned offences committed in the homes of the victims. There were multiple victims and there was both the actual and threatened use of violence. The second offence was committed in the presence of the victim’s children. Of course one of the most serious aspects of both offences, the fact that the victims were tied up was placed on a Form 1, in my opinion inappropriately so. 
     
      
    51 In both robberies the applicant was involved in a significant way. In the first she was actively involved in stealing property from the house while the hapless victims were tied up and threatened. She was involved in placing stolen property into the mother’s vehicle. Some weeks after the robbery the offender was driving the stolen vehicle when she was involved in an accident. 
     
      
    52 In the second offence the applicant made the robbery possible by tricking the victim into opening the door. Certainly thereafter she took no part in what occurred, but that was on the pretext that she herself was a victim. In those circumstances she was morally and legally responsible for what happened in that house. She knew from the earlier robbery how the victims would be treated. I do not accept that her role was a minor one rather her culpability should have been treated as being the same as her co-offenders. 
     
      
    53 During the period that she was on the bonds she was supplying methadone for profit, an offence on the Form 1. She was actively engaged in the robbery of the jewellery store and her DNA was found on a claw hammer left at the scene. 
     
      
    54 The offences before Judge Sides amounted to a very substantial criminal enterprise over a period of about a month, even disregarding the offences for which she was subject to the bonds. Her mental health problems and drug usage should have been given less significance than might otherwise have been the case, in light of the fact that she had previously been given the benefit of a suspended sentence subject to counselling and that she was on bonds at the time of the robberies and other offences being taken into account. 
     
      
    55 When placing her on the bonds, Judge Goldring said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        This matter has been before a court since December last year, when she pleaded guilty and was convicted. Ms Duffy, a psychologist, saw her in December and prepared a report for the court. Ms Verrender, a psycho social worker with the Legal Aid Commission, saw her in June this year and prepared another report. Both of those reports indicate that Miss England has some mental health issues. She has tendencies to become depressed and to be anxious. She has had a number of events in her life which have been traumatic, including being the victim of at least two very serious crimes, and as a result of that her relationship with the Probation and Parole Service has not been terribly good. 
         
         
        It seems to me that rather than placing her under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service, that would be to invite disaster, I would simply advise her that she probably does have some mental health issues and to see a psychologist or someone in the Community Mental Health Team could be a very big benefit to her. 
         
         
        ……….. She now has a house in the Campbelltown area and she lives there with her daughter. Her relationship with [her co-offender] is well and truly over, apparently even if he were not in jail. Miss England’s mother has been here today and she says she has noticed a change in Miss England’s behaviour. 
         
        
       
      
    56 I have quoted this passage to show that the personal considerations that are now being put forward with such force before this Court, as they were before Sides DCJ, were almost identical to those taken into account by Judge Goldring in placing the applicant on a bond notwithstanding that one of the offences before him carried a standard non-parole period of 5 years. Despite the opportunity and advice given to the applicant on that occasion, just 17 days later she committed the offence on the Form 1 of aggravated break and enter of the jewellery store. 
     
      
    57 She received this opportunity from Judge Goldring notwithstanding that she had breached bonds given to her in 1999 and 2004 by reason of failing to attend programmes and not reporting to the Probation Service. The 2004 bond was a result of a suspended sentence, yet no action was taken to revoke the suspension of the sentence because of the breach of the bond. In light of this history less significance could be placed upon her personal circumstances. The substantial leniency that is evident in the sentences imposed upon her by Judge Sides, particularly having regard to the overall non-parole period imposed, was completely unjustified. 
     
      
    58 She was given the benefit of a number of findings in her favour that cannot be supported. The Judge found that her criminality in both offences fell within the mid range of seriousness. Because there was no standard non-parole period applicable, it was not strictly speaking necessary to make such a finding. But in any event it was clearly wrong. The offences were well above mid range for offences of robbery in company and in the second offence she provided the means for the robbery to occur. The Judge said that he took into account the Henry guideline. As I have earlier indicated, that guideline was irrelevant to a determination of the sentences for these offences unless it was to indicate that the sentences to be imposed should be well above that suggested in the guideline. 
     
      
    59 The Judge made the sentences for the offences for which Judge Goldring had placed her upon the bond concurrent with the robbery sentences because “the Court took into account the breach of the bond as an aggravating feature and to avoid an unduly crushing sentence”. The first of those reasons had no validity at all. There is no sense of double punishment in taking into account that an offence was committed in breach of a bond and then imposing a proper sentence for the offence in respect of which the bond was breached. There was no justification in making those sentences concurrent with the robbery sentences on the basis of the totality principle.  
     
      
    60 In my opinion a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months, being the minimum sentence to be served for all the criminality that was before his Honour, was so lenient that it is arguably inadequate. It failed sufficiently to reflect the seriousness of her conduct and said nothing about personal deterrence let alone general deterrence. The second ground should be rejected. 
     
      
    61 The first ground is without merit. A ground asserting disparity is concerned with such markedly and unjustifiably different sentences imposed on co-offenders that they give rise to a genuine feeling on the part of an impartial observer that justice has not been achieved because one offender has been unfairly treated having regard to the sentence passed upon the co-offender. Yet frequently, as in this case, the Court is asked to trawl through the sentencing remarks and the facts and circumstances of the two offenders in detail in order to dissect and weigh every aspect of their competing objective and subjective facts to see whether some variation, however minor, should be made to the sentence of the person who, it is asserted, has a grievance. 
     
      
    62 It should be borne in mind that the High Court’s decisions on this area of appellate intervention speak of “gross”, “marked”, “glaring” or “manifest” disparity. These terms are used throughout the judgments in Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606. Another way of considering the issue is to ask whether the two sentences give rise to an appearance that justice has not been done: per Gibbs CJ at 610 and Dawson J at 623. It should be recalled that the sentences being compared in that case were, on the one hand, a sentence of 6 years imprisonment and, on the other, a non-custodial sentence. 
     
      
    63 No different approach was taken in Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295. Dawson and Gaudron JJ in their joint judgment stated at 301: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……………However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in Lowe v The Queen recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to “a justifiable sense of grievance”. If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options. 
        
       
       
      Gummow J stated at 323: 
       
        
         
        The principle for which Lowe is authority appears to be that the Court of Criminal Appeal intervenes where the difference between the two sentences is manifestly excessive and such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance by giving the appearance, in the mind of an objective observer, that justice has not been done. 
        
       
       
      His Honour then quoted with approval from a decision of Callaway JA in  
      R v Taudevin 
       [1996] 2 VR 402 in which it was pointed out that the important words in considering the issue of disparity were “manifestly” “justifiable” and “objective” and emphasising that the difference between the sentences must be “clearly excessive”. 
       
      
    64 It should be borne in mind that in Postiglione the different sentences being compared were, on the one hand, an effective total sentence of 30 years 10 months and, on the other, 24 years 2 months. 
     
      
    65 Kirby J in Postiglione referred to “the removal of serious and unjustifiable disparities”. He stated at 336 (my underlining and footnotes are not reproduced): 
     
      
       
        
         
        3. Out of recognition of the discretionary character of the sentencing function, and the unavoidable scope for disparity where that function is performed by different judicial officers, it is well established that, when performing their function, sentencing judges must be accorded a wide measure of latitude which will be respected by appellate courts. So long as the sentencing judge has taken into account the relevant considerations of law and fact,  
        the appellate court will not ordinarily intervene merely because some arguable discrepancy appears between the sentencing of otherwise apparently connected or like offenders 
        ……………. 
        
       
      
    66 And later, after referring to numerous decisions on this issue, he wrote at 338 (my underlining and footnotes are not reproduced): 
     
      
       
        
         
        6. Those tests express the criteria for intervention in language which is necessarily very broad.  
        Mere disparity is not enough 
        . What is needed is that the disparity engenders a “justifiable sense of grievance” on the part of the prisoner or “give the appearance that justice has not been done”. It has been stated many times that the fact that the prisoner feels a sense of grievance is not determinative. Say what they may, appellate courts cannot “prevent an unjustified sense of grievance from arising in the minds of sentenced persons”. But the object of the language chosen is to make it plain that  
        some disparities, being inevitable, must be tolerated out of respect for the discretion of sentencing judges 
         and a modest appreciation of the capacity of appellate courts to rectify discrepancies without causing new or different problems…………………….. 
        
       
      
    67 With respect it seems to me that on occasions this Court has sought to address disparity that could not be said to be “manifest”, “glaring”, or “gross”. In one case, to which the Court was taken in the application by Phanith, this Court intervened even though it described the difference in the sentences as “small”. 
     
      
    68 Whatever be the disparity between the sentence imposed upon this applicant and that imposed upon Phanith, I do not consider it is of such a degree that it would warrant this Court intervening. The simple fact is that the applicants were involved in a joint criminal enterprise to rob the victim and his family in their own home and they both continued in that enterprise notwithstanding that they were aware of violence being inflicted upon one of the persons and the members of the family being tied up. They were both drug addicts who had been given ample opportunities to address their addictions and both were in breach of conditional liberty. They also had offences on a Form 1 of a similar type. Judge King was aware of the sentence imposed upon this applicant when sentencing Phanith and purported to apply parity. This Court should pay due regard to the exercise of his sentencing discretion and that of Judge Sides. 
     
      
    69 In any event, Judge Sides ordered an accumulation between the sentences for the two robberies of a period of only 2 years. Having regard to the seriousness of the two offences this was a very lenient result. Even if the Court were to reduce the sentence for the first robbery, in my view it would not make the slightest difference to the overall effective sentence imposed upon the applicant. I have already indicated my view that the non-parole period was very lenient and it could not possibly be reduced. 
     
      
    70 Leave should be granted to appeal but the appeal dismissed.

      Introduction 
       
       
      The applicants Cao and Phan were each charged on indictment that: 
       
       
        
        “Between about 1 April 2005 and about 10 May 2006 at Sydney, New South Wales and elsewhere, [the Applicant] did conspire with [certain named persons] and divers others, to import into Australia goods to which section 233B of the Customs Act 1901 applied, namely, prohibited imports consisting of a quantity of heroin, being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to heroin, contrary to section 233B(1)(a)(iii) Customs Act 1901 & section 11.5 Criminal Code 1995.”  
        
       
       
      The maximum penalty for the offence is life imprisonment and/or a fine of $825,000. 
       
      
    4 The applicant Nguyen was similarly charged though only in respect of the period “Between about 1 November 2005 and about 10 May 2006”. 
     
      
    5 None of the three applicants had any prior convictions. Each pleaded guilty as charged. Cao was sentenced to 24 years imprisonment to commence on 10 May 2006 with a non-parole period of 14 years 6 months to commence on 10 May 2006 and to expire on 9 November 2020. Phan was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment to commence on 10 May 2006 with a non-parole period of 11 years to commence on 10 May 2006 and expire on 9 May 2017. Nguyen was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment to commence on 10 May 2006 with a non-parole period of 8 years 6 months to commence on 10 May 2006 and expire on 9 November 2014. 
     
      
    6 The background to these offences, as outlined in the remarks on sentence, was that Cao, Phan and Cao’s brother, Vu Khahn Nguyen, all of whom were residents of Sydney, organised a series of importations of heroin into Australia from Vietnam during 2005 and 2006. The group used Vietnamese-Australians as couriers to bring into Australia suitcases with heroin concealed inside on their return flights from Vietnam. The main point of entry for these importations was Perth International Airport. The police investigation into the syndicate commenced in October 2005, and interception of the mobile phones used by various syndicate members commenced on 11 November 2005. Police ultimately identified six importations of heroin which had been organised by the syndicate. The evidence established that they occurred on: 
     
      
       
      12 November 2005, the courier being Kim Ut Ly; 
       
       
      16 November 2005, the courier being Vinh Phat Tan; 
       
       
      20 December 2005, the courier being Duc An Tran; 
       
       
      5 February 2006, the courier being Kim Anh Ly; 
       
       
      28 February 2006, the courier being Thi Thanh Ng Ho; 
       
       
      18 April 2006, the courier being Vinh Phat Tan. 
       
      
    7 Each of the applicants has sought leave to appeal against sentence. Each alleges that her Honour erred by overstating the quantity of heroin imported and that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    8 Additionally, Nguyen has asserted that she has a justifiable sense of grievance as a result of a lack of parity with the sentences imposed on her co-offenders and in particular, those imposed on Anh Dung Vu and Kim Anh Ly. Cao alleges a lack of parity with the sentence imposed upon Phan.  
     
      
       
      Background and roles of the applicants 
       
       
      Cao 
       
      
    9 Cao was born in 1975. He is the partner of Phan. He was educated in Vietnam until nine years of age and subsequently attended school in Australia. He left school after completing year nine of high school to work as a tailor in the family business. In 2002 he separated from his wife, with whom he has three children of primary school age. He had a problem with gambling, which he attributed as the reason for the breakdown of his marriage and for his initial involvement in this offence. His motivation was greed. The applicant expressed his remorse and in particular his sorrow for involving other members of his family. Her Honour accepted he genuinely regretted involving his two sisters and brother-in-law. Her Honour considered it difficult to assess his prospects for rehabilitation given the inevitably lengthy period he must remain in custody, but considered they would appear to be reasonable. Her Honour allowed a 25 per cent discount for an early plea. 
     
      
    10 Her Honour described the role of the applicants, Cao and Phan, as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “[Cao and Phan] were principals in this criminal enterprise. Each of them recruited couriers, financed the couriers airfares, expenses, and fees for the importation, liaised with the man Bay Chanh in Vietnam, who on behalf of the syndicate oversaw the couriers activities and their payment while they were in Vietnam, helped organise one of the other syndicate members to meet the couriers on their arrival in Perth, and to escort the suitcases to Sydney, organised two people to meet the courier Tan, who was expected to arrive in Darwin on 18 April 2006, maintained regular phone contact with the couriers while they were in Vietnam, maintained regular telephone contact with those who had been sent to meet the couriers on their arrival, and had telephone contact with people about the supply of the drugs and the payment of money. Peter Cao had other responsibilities in that he instructed Bay Chanh when to collect the suitcases with the heroin concealed inside from the supplier, Tan (the uncle) and to hand it over to the couriers, just prior to their return to Australia. He did not liaise personally with the uncle who supplied and concealed the heroin in the suitcases, rather Mr Cao liaised with his brother-in-law, Mr Vu, who in turn had direct contact with the man referred to as Uncle. In this way Mr Cao kept himself at arms length from the supplier and from the risks that direct contact would entail. He and Vu Khahn would then on-supply the heroin to various purchasers in Sydney.” 
        
       
       
      Phan 
       
      
    11 This applicant was born in 1957. She came to Australia from Vietnam in 1990 and is an Australian citizen. She has been married three times and has seven children (none by Cao), as well as caring for two grandchildren aged six and seven whose mother is serving a term of life imprisonment in Vietnam for drug offences. Her Honour said that to the limited extent she was able to do so, she had taken into account the hardship the children will suffer by their mother and grandmother being in prison. The applicant’s sentence was discounted 25 per cent by reason of an early plea. 
     
      
       
      Nguyen 
       
      
    12 This applicant was born in 1979. She is the sister of Cao. She arrived in Australia in 1985 and attended school from year three, leaving in year ten and then working in the family business as a machinist. She has two children who are in the care of their maternal grandparents. The care of the grandchildren is difficult as neither grandparent is in good health and they are aged 65 and 68 respectively. Her Honour allowed 15 per cent discount for her plea of guilty which had been entered at a relatively late stage. 
     
      
    13 Her Honour described her role in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “[She] was involved in the importations of December 2005, 5 and 28 February, and 18 April 2006, a total of approximately five kilograms of pure heroin. Her role was to meet the couriers on their arrival in Perth. Specifically she travelled to Perth to meet Vu Khahn and Tran on their arrival from Vietnam on 20 December 2005. With Vu Khahn she oversaw Tran’s trip to Sydney on 20 December 2005 with the imported heroin. She accompanied the courier Ho to Perth in January 2006 to assist Ms Ho’s passport application and the purchase of airline tickets and necessary visas for Ho and her children to travel to Vietnam. She travelled to Perth with her husband Vu, to meet the courier Kim Ahn Ly. She oversaw Kim Ahn Ly’s trip to Sydney of 5 February 2006 with the imported heroin. She travelled to Sydney with her sister My Hanh to meet the courier Ms Ho on 27 February 2006. She relayed instructions from Peter Cao to her husband Mr Vu. She remained in regular telephone contact with the offender Cao and Phan and carried out their instructions. She also kept her husband, Mr Vu, appraised of developments. She could accurately be described as a trusted lieutenant, or second-in-charge of the principals, Peter Cao and Ana Phan.” 
        
       
       
      Dung Vu 
       
      
    14 Vu was born in 1973 in South Vietnam. He married the Applicant Nguyen in January 2000. He led a fairly simple life in Vietnam, his parents being vegetable sellers at the market and he worked at their stall. He came to Australia in 2001. His marriage is apparently completely broken down. Her Honour found his prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable. He was charged with the same offence as Nguyen. He pleaded not guilty, went to trial and was found guilty. He was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment commencing on 12 December 2006 and expiring on 11 December 2022 with a non-parole period of 9 years and 6 months commencing on 12 December 2006 and expiring on 11 June 2016.  
     
      
    15 His role in the conspiracy, as found by her Honour, was: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the evidence presented in his trial which the jury must have accepted, this offender’s role in the agreement was to liaise directly with the heroin supplier and the person who concealed it in suitcases in Vietnam, a man variously referred to as Ong Lun, Than, Shortie, Mr Shortie, or ‘the uncle’ in the trial and the telephone intercepts. In late November 2005 the offender travelled to Vietnam and in fact he met with the supplier there. Thereafter he was the only person who passed on messages and received messages from him. That fact was established by means of telephone intercepts which were in existence on a large number of phones held by the various offenders. Some of the messages themselves were intercepted by the offender used his wife’s telephone on which there was a lawfully obtained telephone intercept. The offender’s own mobile phone or phones were never intercepted and the evidence in the trial established that he regularly changed his SIM card. The offender also travelled from Australia to Thailand from 24 January to 1 February 2006. He accompanied his wife when she went to meet the courier, Kim Ahn Ly in early February 2006. Quite clearly he had a crucial role in this criminal enterprise to import large quantities of heroin into Australia. His involvement related to the same importations as his wife, a total of approximately five kilos of pure heroin. While he has a different role to play from that of his wife I find that his level of responsibility is equal to hers, that of a trusted lieutenant. He was the person the principals, Cao and Phan entrusted to be the direct contact with the supplier of heroin in Vietnam.” 
        
       
       
      Kim Ahn Ly 
       
      
    16 This offender was born in Vietnam in 1969. She had limited education, leaving school at 14. She came to Australia in 1989 and spent two years in a refugee camp. She has four children, the eldest of whom is 18 years old and remains in Western Australia. She also has a 14 year old daughter and the other two children, a girl aged six and a boy aged eight months. This offender pleaded guilty to two counts on an indictment. Count 1 was that between about 1 September 2005 and about 20 November 2005, she conspired with named others to import not less than the trafficable quantity of heroin into Australia. Count 2 was that between about 6 January 2006 and about 20 February 2006, she conspired with named others to import a marketable quantity of heroin to Australia. 
     
      
    17 Her role in the conspiracy, as found by her Honour, was: 
     
      
       
        
        “… she was the syndicate’s Perth contact as she was a resident of Western Australia. She went with Vu Khahn to meet the couriers Kim Ut Ly and Vinh Phat Tan when they arrived at Perth International Airport on 12 November and 16 November 2005 respectively. She remained in regular telephone contact with Peter Cao and Ana Phan and carried out their instructions. When Kim Ut Ly failed to emerge from the arrivals lounge she made a number of enquiries until she located her. She provided her home for Vu Khahn to repair the suitcase containing heroin that had been damaged by customs officers when they drilled into it searching unsuccessfully for heroin. Vu Khahn also took the suitcase of heroin that had been brought in by Tan to her home. She took the heroin brought in by Kim Ut Ly to Sydney by train as instructed by Peter Cao and Ana Phan, travelling with her husband and child on 16 November 2005, arriving in Sydney on 19 November. 
         
         
        In respect of count 2, this offender travelled to Vietnam in January 2006 on behalf of the syndicate and returned with heroin concealed in at least one suitcase on 5 February 2006. On the same day, she conveyed the heroin to Sydney. From the intercepted phone calls, it appears that she was paid $10,000 in addition to expenses in respect of this importation. In respect of the first count, she is to be sentenced on the basis that she was trusted to carry out in Perth the instructions and requirements of the syndicate heads who were based in Sydney. As to count 2, she is to be sentenced on the basis that she was a courier bringing more than the marketable quantity of heroin into Australia, approximately one kilogram.” 
        
       
      
    18 The maximum penalty for these offences was imprisonment for 25 years and/or a fine of $550,000. The trafficable or marketable quantity was 2 grams of pure heroin. This offender pleaded guilty on the third day of her trial. Her sentences were reduced by 10 per cent for the pleas. She was convicted in respect of both counts and was sentenced, as to the first count, to imprisonment for 8 years to commence on 24 July 2006 and expire on 23 July 2014. As to count 2 she was sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years to commence on 24 July 2008 and expire on 23 July 2016. A single non-parole period of 5 years to date from 24 July 2006 and expire on 23 July 2011 was set. Her Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
        “The youngest child was born when the offender was in custody and was removed from her after a few days. Naturally this is a matter of great distress to her and she would like to be included in the mothers and children program which allows children to remain with their mothers up until school age. The offender is not able to be included in such a program until she is sentenced. I heard evidence from Ms Belinda McInnes who has been the co-ordinator of this program for six years. She was not able to speculate about what decision would be made about the offender’s application but there had been no problems with the offender’s conduct while in prison. Ms McInnes did say that if the offender’s non-parole period exceeded six years the process would be ‘a lot more difficult’. While I cannot impose a non-parole period on that basis alone, it is a relevant factor. The evidence establishes that the offender’s partner is having difficulty coping with the three children in Sydney, a city unfamiliar to him. He is ‘struggling as a single parent’. That is not surprising as he has the sole care of an eight month old baby and two other school aged children, both of whom are apparently reacting to the absence of their mother and to the move from their previous home in Perth. I find the hardship occasioned to this family by the offender’s imprisonment to be so exceptional that I am able to take it into account on sentence.” 
        
       
       
      Consideration 
       
       
      Ground 1: Her Honour erred by overstating the quantity of heroin imported – Cao and Phan 
       
      
    19 The police successfully intercepted only the last two of the six identified importations. The amount of pure heroin involved in those importations was said by the Crown to be 1.9 kilograms and 862 grams respectively. The Crown was unable to establish by direct evidence the amount of heroin imported on the first four occasions. 
     
      
    20 Her Honour, in her remarks on sentence, said the: 
     
      
       
        
        “… first two offenders, Peter Cao and Ana Phan were responsible for the six identified importation into Australia involving approximately seven kilograms of pure heroin over the five month period, November 2005 to April 2006.” 
        
       
      
    21 The applicants submitted her Honour’s finding that the importations involved approximately 7 kilograms of pure heroin was a finding of fact which was not open to her on the available evidence. It was further submitted that the error was one of significance as the size of an importation is a relevant factor to which sentencing courts must have regard: Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584, at [67], R v Lee [2000] NSWCCA 234 at [23]. Her Honour’s error required correction by this Court. 
     
      
    22 The source of her Honour’s finding as to the amount of pure heroin involved in the importations appears to have been the written submissions of the Crown, which were tendered at the sentencing hearing, and which asserted: 
     
      
       
        
        “Cao and Phan arranged at least six separate importations of heroin from Vietnam into Australia and the estimated amount of pure heroin imported was approximately 7 kilograms: 
         
         
        (i) 12 November 2005 – conservatively estimated at 1 kilogram (one suitcase brought in by Kim Ut Ly); 
         
         
        (ii) 15 November 2005 – conservatively estimated at 1 kilogram (one suitcase brought in by Vinh Phat Tan; 
         
         
        (iii) 20 December 2005 – conservatively estimated at 1 kilogram (one suitcase brought in by Duc An Tran; 
         
         
        (iv) 5 February 2006 – conservatively estimated at 1 kilogram (one suitcase brought in by Kim Anh Ly; 
         
         
        (v) 28 February 2006 – Ho’s 2 suitcases seized and found to contain 1.9 kilograms (pure); and 
         
         
        (vi) 18 April 2006 – Tan’s suitcase seized and found to contain 862 grams (pure).” 
        
       
      
    23 The only evidence on this issue which was indisputably before the sentencing judge was the summary of facts which had been prepared by the Crown and accepted by the applicants. The relevant parts of the summary of facts were: 
     
      
       
      (a) Paragraph 33 which stated: 
       
       
        
        “Both of the November importations had been successful in that the couriers, Kim Ut Ly and Vinh Phat Tan were not intercepted by the authorities and the group obtained the imported heroin. It is believed that each courier carried one suitcase within each of which an amount of heroin was concealed. It appears (from the couriers who were subsequently intercepted by the authorities) that the amount of heroin concealed within each suitcase would have been about 1 kilogram of heroin (of about 75% purity).”  
        
       
       
      (b) Paragraph 102 which stated, in respect of the second last importation, that: 
       
       
        
        “[On 28 February 2006] [a]fter alighting from Singapore flight SQ221, Thi Nga Thanh HO, was searched by Australian Customs officers and a quantity of heroin was located. Ho was then arrested.” 
        
       
       
      The quantity of heroin located was not stated. 
       
       
      (c) Paragraph 127 which stated, in respect of the last importation intercepted, “[Tan’s] luggage was searched by Customs and 1.109 kg of heroin (gross) was located”. 
       
      
    24 Included in the documents before this Court were the sentencing remarks of McKechnie J in proceedings against Ho. The remarks on sentence commenced: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 17 July this year you pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of heroin into Australia. The gross weight of heroin powder was 2638.9 grams with an average purity of 72.75 per cent and a weight of 1.9 kilograms pure heroin.”  
        
       
      
    25 This Court also had before it the sentencing remarks of Hughes DCJ in the sentence proceedings against Tan. His Honour recorded a plea of guilty by the offender to importing 862 grams of pure heroin, 1,109.2 grams gross. 
     
      
    26 An initial question on appeal was whether the sentencing remarks of McKechnie J and Hughes DCJ were in evidence before the sentencing judge. There is no doubt that her Honour received the sentencing remarks (Tr 22.11.07 p 59) and that she had regard to them in determining sentence. 
     
      
    27 The Crown contended that the sentencing remarks formed part of Exhibit A at the sentencing hearing. However, Exhibit A had been lost.  
     
      
    28 On the evidence before me, I am unable to accept that the sentencing remarks formed part of Exhibit A, as: 
     
      
       
      (a) they were not among the documents described as included in Exhibit A at the time of the tender nor were they described at that time as documents to be included in the tender at a later time; 
       
       
      (b) her Honour did not receive the documents until 21 November 2007; 
       
       
      (c) there was no evidence the sentencing remarks were subsequently added to Exhibit A. 
       
      
    29 There was no evidence the sentencing remarks were formally tendered, or that there was a formal agreement as to the amounts of pure heroin imported by Ho and Tan.  
     
      
    30 However, counsel for the applicants (who was not counsel on appeal) was aware of the sentencing remarks (Tr 22.11.07 p 59) and of the Crown’s submissions which made specific reference to the amounts of pure heroin involved in the last two importations (Tr 13.12.07 p 9).  
     
      
    31 The following exchanges occurred at the sentencing hearing:  
     
      
       
        
        (a) “[COUNSEL]: We were talking about approximately a kilo on each time, it was more or less, sometimes above, sometimes a bit below, but generally that was about the estimation, not the – and I am talking about the impure quantity …  
         
         
        HER HONOUR: We don’t really know, I mean we have Ms Ho’s quantity which was over the commercial quantity, at the bottom of the commercial quantity range but a number of importations of course we just simply don’t know so the Crown has alleged, what do they call it now, marketable, not trafficable, the marketable quantity.”  
         
         
        (b) “[COUNSEL]: Your Honour may be moved to look at the decision in Western Australian decision [sic] in relation to Ms Ho (?). 
         
         
        HER HONOUR: Ms Ho, certainly gives me some assistance in respect of the couriers in terms of parity issues. Starting point was 15 years for what we sometimes describe as a bare courier. 
         
         
        [COUNSEL]: Yes your Honour, it’s a decision that I would not suggest to you that a great deal of time should be spent of considering that. I think the figure is perhaps a little high … In the other case of Tan the starting point I think is 10 years according to Judge Hughes and that may be a more realistic point from which to start.”  
        
       
      
    32 It is clear from those comments that counsel for the applicants was aware of the quantity of the importations made by Ho and Tan and he regarded that information as forming part of the material to which he and the Court were entitled to have regard. He expressly dealt with the Crown’s written submissions, but raised no objection to para 12 thereof, which expressly relied upon the actual quantities imported on the last two occasions. 
     
      
    33 In my opinion, it is clear that the sentencing hearing was conducted on the basis that the parties and the Court would have regard to the amounts of pure heroin imported by Ho on 28 February 2006 and by Tan on 18 April 2006.  
     
      
    34 The Crown submitted that the importation by Ho involved 1.9 kilograms of pure heroin and the importation by Tan on 18 April 2006 involved 862 grams of pure heroin. The average of the pure heroin contained in each of the three suitcases involved in those importations was 915 grams. If the average importation was 915 grams, then the total importation was 6,405 grams, which was within the range of her Honour’s approximation. If her Honour’s approximation of the total amount of heroin imported in the six known importations was considered to be an error, it was an error which was of little or no consequence to the sentencing of the applicants. 
     
      
    35 Counsel for Cao submitted that this Court should rely only upon the agreed facts and inferences therefrom and should find the amount of pure heroin imported was 4.5 kilograms, ie, 750 grams multiplied by six.  
     
      
    36 Counsel for Phan submitted that the Court should rely upon a total importation of 4.5 kilograms, or, if the actual figures for the last two importations were coupled with each of the four earlier importations, being of 750 grams pure heroin, a total amount of 5.762 kilograms resulted, which was materially and substantially different from the approximately 7 kilograms found by her Honour. 
     
      
    37 In R v Palu (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 Howie J (with whom the other members of the Court agreed), at [21], said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… If it purports to be an agreed statement of facts so that it is intended to provide the factual basis upon which the parties wish the court to sentence the offender, the facts should be sufficient to permit the court to exercise its discretion and the Crown should not tender other material which might supplement or contradict the facts set out in the agreed statement. If other material is placed before the courts which relates to the facts of the offence, then the parties should understand that the court is not bound by the tendered statement of facts or any agreement made between the parties as to the basis upon which the offender is to be sentenced:  
        Altham 
         (1992) 62 A Crim R 126;  
        Chow v DPP 
         (1992) 28 NSWLR 593 at 606. All too frequently, or so it seems to me, uncertainty, confusion and, sometimes, error arises because of the failure of the parties, and in particular the Crown, to clearly identify the material upon which the facts of the matter are to be gleaned by the sentencing court.” 
        
       
      
    38 In this matter the actual amounts of pure heroin imported in the first four importations are not capable of being established other than by inference. The amounts imported in the last two importations are known. They provided the best evidence as to the approximate amount of pure heroin imported on the first four occasions. In my opinion, it is appropriate to take the average of the contents of the three suitcases involved in the last two importations to arrive at the most likely estimate of the amounts of pure heroin imported in the first four importations. 
     
      
    39 The resulting figure of 6,405 grams is, in my opinion, within the range of her Honour’s approximation of 7 kilograms and no error has been demonstrated. Nor has any miscarriage of justice occurred, notwithstanding that her Honour’s calculation may have been reached by a somewhat different route than has now been taken. These grounds of appeal accordingly fail.  
     
      
       
      Nguyen 
       
      
    40 Nguyen was concerned only with the last four importations. Her Honour held that these importations involved importation of approximately 5 kilograms of pure heroin. It was submitted that this finding was a finding of fact which was not open to her Honour and that, on the available evidence, it was only open to her Honour to find that those importations involved a total of 3 kilograms of pure heroin, being 75 grams in each of four suitcases.  
     
      
    41 Nguyen was present in court with Cao and Phan on 19 November 2007 when Exhibit A, which included the Crown’s submissions, was tendered, and again on 22 February 2008 when she, Cao and Phan were sentenced. However, Nguyen’s sentencing hearing occurred on 21 November 2007. She was not present at the sentencing hearing of Cao and Phan on 22 November 2007, when her Honour first referred to having received the sentencing remarks of McKechnie J and Hughes DCJ.  
     
      
    42 The transcript of Nguyen’s sentencing hearing does not record any reference to the sentencing remarks in respect of Ho and Tan, or the amounts of pure heroin imported by them on 28 February 2006 and 18 April 2006 respectively. 
     
      
    43 However, Nguyen’s counsel had received the Crown’s submissions that contained reference to the importation by Ho and Tan and the total amount of pure heroin alleged to be imported by them. As he made no objection to these submissions (and they were referred to on a number of occasions, including by him), in my opinion, it should be concluded that Nguyen’s sentencing hearing was conducted on the basis that the court could have regard to the statements in the Crown’s submissions as to the actual amounts of pure heroin imported in the last two importations, without the necessity for formal proof of those amounts. If objection had been taken to this course, evidence relevant to the size of the shipments could have been led. In these circumstances and as there is no reason to believe that the statements in the Crown’s submissions were inaccurate, Nguyen should be treated as bound by the manner in which the case was conducted before the sentencing judge (see generally Crampton v The Queen [2000] HCA 60; (2001) 206 CLR 161 at [12]-[20]; [47]-[52]; [150], [165]; Fingleton v The Queen [2005] HCA 34; (2005) 227 CLR 166). 
     
      
    44 Adopting the calculations made in respect of Cao and Phan, the total importation of pure heroin for the last four importations is 4,575 grams. This is within the range of approximately 5 kilograms adopted by her Honour. 
     
      
    45 In my opinion, no error or miscarriage of justice has resulted from her Honour’s finding of importation of approximately 5 kilograms. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Excessive  
       
      
    46 The sentencing judge held the enterprise was: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a sophisticated and successful criminal enterprise of great objective gravity. The only motivation appears to have been the opportunity to make large amounts of money easily. Even after the arrest of the courier, Ms Ho, in February 2006 the offenders were not deterred from their chosen path other than temporarily. Had their activities not been brought to a halt by their arrest in May 2006, no doubt they would have continued in their endeavours.” 
        
       
      
    47 The applicants submitted the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. They sought to support that submission by reference to sentences imposed in earlier cases, including cases contained in the Schedule appended to the judgment of this Court in R v Lee. Senior counsel for Phan referred the Court to some additional cases which, as he observed, were not truly comparable.  
     
      
    48 There was also reference to the cases collected in the Schedule appended to R v Wong & Leung [1999] NSWCCA 420; 48 NSWLR 340; 108 A Crim R 531. It was conceded, correctly in my opinion, that as those cases were concerned with couriers and low-level participants in importations they were of little assistance in the circumstances of the subject cases. This Court has also expressed doubts as to the continuing utility of those authorities: N v R; AP v R [2009] NSWCCA 108 at [38]. 
     
      
    49 The difficulty faced by the applicants in this regard was that her Honour had found the roles of Cao and Phan were those of principals, whilst the role of Nguyen was that of second in charge. Few of the cases referred to were concerned with persons so high in the hierarchy. Senior counsel for Phan observed, “I have been unable to find anything which is a truly comparable case, that is, cases post the repeal of s 16G [of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)]”. It was accepted that her Honour could take into account that the importations in this case would have continued but for the arrest of the conspirators.  
     
      
    50 Two cases were reasonably comparable.  
     
      
    51 The first of these was Regina v Jack Chick Chen [2003] NSWCCA 328. Chen was either a principal or, at the least, a significant organiser in the hierarchy of a conspiracy to import heroin. 12.6 kilograms were imported in two air shipments. The imports would have continued but for the conspirators being arrested. A plea of guilty was entered. Chen was sentenced to a total of 31 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 23 years. He received a discount of 20 per cent pursuant to s 16G. 
     
      
    52 The second of these was Lee. In Lee the offender had been charged with importing 76.3 kilograms of heroin in two shipping containers. He was in charge of the organisation in Australia, but not at the pinnacle. He pleaded not guilty but was convicted and on a Crown appeal, sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 years and 11 months with an additional term of 8 years and 6 months. This Court observed in that case, at [38]: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is little, apart from the fact that he has no prior criminal history, to ameliorate the sentence and that is of minimal significance. But for the fact that this is a Crown appeal a non-parole period significantly in excess of 20 years was appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    53 It was submitted that these cases were distinguishable, as the amount of heroin involved was much greater than that involved in the present case and the enterprises were more sophisticated.  
     
      
    54 However, as observed by the High Court in Wong v R at [67]-[69], the particular amount of narcotic involved can have significance in fixing the sentence to be imposed, but in many cases: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a sentencing judge will be more concerned to identify the level of the offender's criminality by looking to the state of the offender's knowledge about the importation in which he or she was involved.” 
        
       
      
    55 Sentencing involves a discretionary judgment. There is no single correct sentence and judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime which applies: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 215 ALR 213. 
     
      
    56 As there is no single correct sentence, it is necessary for the appeal court to evaluate the permissible range of sentence in the light of all the admissible considerations affecting the case in hand, and drawing upon its own accumulated knowledge and experience: R v Holder [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 254 in order to determine if the sentence imposed is so excessive as to manifest error.  
     
      
    57 As McClellan CJ at CL observed in Lee, at [37], in respect of the Schedule of Cases: 
     
      
       
        
        “If comparisons are confined to sentences imposed after the repeal of s 16G of the  
        Crimes Act  
        it can be seen that offenders who, although not at the pinnacle, were key organisers or critical to the success of the operation received head sentences in excess of 20 years and a number received life sentences. Non-parole periods are also significantly greater than the 11 years imposed on the respondent.” 
        
       
      
    58 An analysis of previous cases referred to does not cause me to conclude that the sentences for Cao and Phan were other than appropriate sentences for principals in a long-standing and ongoing conspiracy, the object of which was to make multiple importations of heroin. There is no conflict between these sentences and those imposed in earlier cases to which reference has been made. Similarly, the cases referred to do not cause me to conclude that the sentence imposed upon Nguyen was inappropriate. In my opinion, the sentences imposed upon the applicants have not been demonstrated to be manifestly excessive, particularly having regard to the fact that the offence attracts a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 
     
      
    59 I reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: Parity  
       
      
    60 The principles developed as to parity in sentencing may be briefly stated as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) “… the parity principle, as identified and explained in  
      Lowe v R 
       [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to ‘a justifiable sense of grievance’. If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it was otherwise appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options.” ( 
      Postiglione v R 
       [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ) 
       
       
      (b) “It is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal, and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender, and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence, have to be taken into account.” ( 
      Lowe v R 
       at 609 per Gibbs CJ)  
       
       
      (c) These principles apply both in relation to the head sentence and also in relation to non-parole periods:  
      R v Bell 
       [1999] NSWCCA 423 per Simpson J at [15].  
       
       
      (d) Where there is a degree of disparity such as to invite a reduction in the sentence imposed, it is not necessary for this court to intervene if the result of doing so is to produce a sentence disproportionate to the objectiveness of the criminality involved:  
      R v Steele 
       (NSWCCA, 17 April 1997, unreported);  
      R v Boney 
       [2001] NSWCCA 432 at [15]. 
       
       
      Cao and Phan 
       
      
    61 The sentences imposed on Cao () and Phan () involve a disparity of six years in relation to the head sentence and three years six months in respect of the non-parole period.  
     
      
    62 Her Honour found that the objective gravity of Phan’s conduct was slightly less than Cao’s as he had overall control of the enterprise and that Phan had a more powerful subjective case because of her age and the needs of her children and grandchildren. 
     
      
    63 Cao submitted that the disparity was such as to promote a sense of justifiable grievance in him. It was submitted that whilst there may have been differences in the parts played by them, there was not a qualitative distinction in their criminality. It was accepted that whilst Phan possessed a more powerful subjective case, because of her age and the needs of her children and grandchildren those factors did not justify a differentiation in sentence of six years. 
     
      
    64 The issue is whether differences between the objective and subjective cases of these applicants are sufficient to explain and justify the disparity. 
     
      
    65 The differences between the objective and subjective situations of Cao and Phan were: 
     
      
       
      (a) Cao was the originator of the conspiracy.  
       
       
      (b) It was Cao who involved Phan in the illegal operations. He recruited her because of her financial need. Phan had very little contact with persons in Vietnam and no contact at all with the supplier.  
       
       
      (c) Cao involved his sisters and his brother-in-law in the conspiracy and, as a result, caused them to face lengthy prison terms. 
       
       
      (d) Cao, as her Honour observed, had additional responsibilities to those of Phan. 
       
       
      (e) Phan had a much stronger subjective case because of her age and the needs of her children and grandchildren.  
       
      
    66 In my opinion, once allowance is made for the differences between the situations of Cao and Phan, there is no marked disparity such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    67 I reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Nguyen and Vu 
       
      
    68 The sentence imposed on Nguyen was  and on Vu, . There was a difference in the starting point for each sentence, Nguyen’s starting point being 17 years and 8 months, Vu’s being 16 years.  
     
      
    69 Nguyen submitted that the difference between her sentence and the sentence imposed upon Vu gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on her part. 
     
      
    70 It was submitted by Nguyen that Vu had a larger and more important role in the conspiracy than she did. It was submitted Vu dealt directly with the supplier and arranged for the heroin to be secreted in suitcases so that it could be imported. This was central to the conspiracy. The applicant’s role was that she travelled to Perth on three occasions to assist in the transport of heroin to Sydney. On one of these occasions Vu was also present. She assisted the courier Ho with travel arrangements, due to Ho’s difficulty with English and unfamiliarity with Perth. 
     
      
    71 The justification for the disparity is explained by the following comments of her Honour: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) While [Vu] has a different role to play from that of his wife, I find that his level of responsibility is equal to hers, that of a trusted lieutenant.” 
         
         
        (b) While objectively I find [Vu’s] criminality equal to that of his wife, subjectively he is in a slightly better position. I accept that but for his marriage and his involvement with this family he was unlikely to have become involved in such an offence. He was a reasonably unsophisticated person living in Vietnam prior to his marriage. However, his motivation, apart from his family connections was greed, and there was evidence in the trial of his having acquired a BMW for more than $50,000.” 
        
       
      
    72 The issue is whether those differences were sufficient to explain and justify the starting point for the sentence of Nguyen as compared to the starting point for Vu’s sentence. 
     
      
    73 In my opinion, it was open to her Honour to conclude that Nguyen and Vu’s objective criminality was equal. Once that conclusion was reached and a deduction was made for the subjective factors identified by her Honour, it could not, in my opinion, be concluded that there was a marked disparity such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    74 I reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Nguyen and Kim Ahn Ly 
       
      
    75 Nguyen’s sentence was . Ly’s overall effective sentence was . 
     
      
    76 The applicants submitted that although the charges were different, the same version of facts was applicable. Notwithstanding the exceptional hardship found by her Honour, there remained a need for proportionality particularly as by reason of imprisonment, Nguyen’s two young children aged four and five were deprived of both parents, whereas Kim Ahn Ly’s partner was available to care for her children, although he was struggling with the task. 
     
      
    77 Her Honour did not, in her remarks on sentence, consider the question of parity between Nguyen and Ahn Ly. 
     
      
    78 It is apparent there were two significant differences between Nguyen and Ahn Ly, namely: 
     
      
       
      (a) Nguyen was further up the hierarchy than Ahn Ly. Nguyen was the next in charge after the principals, whereas Ahn Ly was a courier and the Perth contact.  
       
       
      (b) Ahn Ly had recently given birth to a child and her Honour concluded, as she was entitled to do, that this and other domestic matters constituted “exceptional hardship” and permitted her Honour to accord it substantial weight for the purpose of sentencing:  
      Regina v Togias 
       [2001] NSWCCA 522; 127 A Crim R 23. 
       
      
    79 In my opinion, once regard is had to the identified differences, there was no marked disparity such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    80 Nguyen sought an extension of time in which to appeal and leave to appeal against her sentence. The application was not opposed and the circumstances are such that the Court considers it appropriate to and does grant the extension of time sought. 
     
      
    81 In my opinion, leave to appeal should be granted in respect of each applicant, but each appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    82 I propose the following orders in each case: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted; 
       
       
      (2) Appeal dismissed.

   JUDGMENT1. These are proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence. Accordingly under s 294B(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 the complainant, if called as witness, is entitled to give evidence by means of closed circuit television facilities. The complainant in this case has so elected, thereby exercising her entitlement.2. Mr Thangaraj who appears for the accused has applied under section 294B for an order that the complainant not give her evidence by means of closed circuit television facilities. Mr Moberley who appears as Crown Prosecutor opposes that application.3. A court may make such an order “only if it is satisfied that there are special reasons, in the interests of justice, for the complainant’s evidence not to be given by such means”: see s 294B(6). Mr Thangaraj argues that this is a case where the circumstances are such that I should exercise my discretion. 4. His client faces 28 charges. Six of those are prescribed sexual offences. The charges, it is common ground, arise out of a relationship between the complainant and the accused which went on for some years. It involved consensual sexual intercourse at various stages. The charges on the indictment not only include the six prescribed sexual offences which I have referred to but charges such as assault and demanding money with menaces and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. All of those charges are ones in respect of which the complainant is the alleged victim.5. Mr Thangaraj argues that his cross-examination will be stilted and his client will be deprived of his right to be confronted by his accuser. He points out that my discretion should be excited in this case by two principal factors. One is that the offences occurred in the context of a very lengthy relationship which included a consensual sexual relationship. The second factor is that the significant majority of the charges on the indictment are not prescribed sexual offences. 6. The fact that his client is not confronted by his accuser and that cross-examination will be rendered more difficult do not, in my opinion, amount to special reasons in the interests of justice to order that the facilities not be used. I am not suggesting that Mr Thangaraj urged me to accept that proposition but it seems to me that those are consequences which flow naturally from the operation of the statutes as Mr Moberley pointed out. 7. The purpose of the legislation was referred to in R v Sudath [2008] NSWCCA 207. In a judgment of the Chief Judge at Common Law, with whom Hidden J and Fullerton J agreed, his Honour said at [29] that it was “because of the personal trauma likely to be experienced by a complainant when giving evidence that s 294B was enacted.”8. In my opinion the submissions of Mr Thangaraj would involve an inappropriate isolation of those charges on the indictment involving prescribed sexual offences. The personal trauma which the legislature is attempting to reduce would, in my opinion, still be experienced by the complainant in this case because of the nature of many of the other allegations involving violence or threatening behaviour. 9. The fact that the allegations are in the context of a lengthy relationship which includes consensual sexual relations is also not in my opinion a special reason which would warrant, in the interests of justice, me dispensing with the use of the facilities. Many cases involve lengthy consensual sexual relationships. Indeed Sudath was a case involving violence within a marriage. 10. In my opinion there is nothing in this case which would satisfy me that there are special reasons in the interests of justice for the complainant’s evidence not to be given by closed circuit television facilities. For these reasons I ruled yesterday that Mr Thangaraj’s application would be rejected.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of two sentences imposed on him by Ashford DCJ in the District Court at Parramatta on 1 December 2008. Each sentence was for an offence of breaking and entering a dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely stealing: Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 112(1). 
     
      
    2 On the first offence, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months to commence on 31 July 2008 and to expire on 30 January 2010. On the second offence, he was imprisoned for a term of three years, comprising a non-parole period of two years, commencing on 30 April 2009 and expiring on 29 April 2011, with a balance of term of 12 months, expiring on 29 April 2012. As may be seen from the respective commencement dates, her Honour accumulated the second sentence upon the applicant serving one-half (nine months) of the first sentence. 
     
      
    3 Leave should be granted in respect of each sentence, because there was no order by her Honour pursuant to s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) directing that the applicant be released on parole upon completing the specified non-parole period. Otherwise in each case, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    Background circumstances4 The first offence was committed at a home in Revesby at some point between 29 September and 2 October 2007. The house broken into was empty during that period. In giving evidence on sentence, the applicant was invited to recall the circumstances of the offence but was unable to do so, because he was using the drug “ice” at that time: Tcpt, 01/12/08, p 6.  
     
      
    5 The sentencing judge described the discovery of the offence by a father when he attended the house occupied by his son and the son’s family. 
     
      
       
        
        “On arrival [he] noted a hole in the front lounge room window next to the front door and the rear sliding door was wide open. The police were contacted. It was found that numerous items were missing from the house, all three bedrooms having been ransacked as well as the bathroom and the laundry. All the jewellery of the victims had been stolen and there was also missing a Toshiba brand laptop, personal electronic diary and more jewellery from the other bedroom.” 
        
       
      
    6 The applicant was not arrested until 31 July 2008. However, approximately three days after the first offence, he committed a second offence at a dwelling in Bankstown. He was inside the premises when two female members of the family returned and entered through the front door. He was seen to run towards the back door and, while struggling to open it, was grabbed by one of the women. He freed himself and fled through the back door. 
     
      
    7 Entry had been effected by removing a flyscreen from the rear kitchen window and smashing the glass. Drawers and cupboards in the bedrooms had been opened and ransacked. Two bags were located at the top of the stairs, one a small suitcase containing documents of importance, the second a gym bag containing items collected from the bedrooms, including watches, jewellery and a portable DVD player. A wristwatch belonging to one of the occupants was found on the front lawn. 
     
      
    8 Further details relating to the subjective circumstances of the applicant, the fact that he was on parole at the time of the offences and that he had a long record of criminality, though not for the particular type of offences in question, were all set out by the sentencing judge in her judgment. It is not necessary that those circumstances be repeated for present purposes. 
     
      
    First ground: “financial gain” as aggravating circumstance9 The first ground of appeal concerned a statement made by the sentencing judge “in relation to circumstances of aggravation” that it “was clear the offences were committed for a financial gain noting that the items taken were of some significant value”: Judgment, p 6. The basis for this comment was s 21A(2)(o) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, as amended on 1 January 2008 to include a motive of “financial gain” as an aggravating factor: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2007 (NSW), Sch 1 [5]. Two challenges were raised in respect of this statement. First, it was said that financial gain could not be a circumstance of aggravation in this case, because it was an inherent characteristic of the particular class of offence for which the applicant had been convicted. Reference was made to the judgment of this Court in Elyard v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 43, at [17]: 
     
      
       
        
        “As discussed above, it is necessary to distinguish cases where a factor identified in sub-s 21A(2) [of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999  
        (NSW)] as an aggravating factor is an element of an offence or, in the sense described above, an inherent characteristic or a characteristic that appertains generally to conduct covered by that offence, on the one hand, and other conduct which cannot properly be so described.” 
        
       
      
    10 Too much weight should not be given to the labelling of particular considerations in reasons for sentence. The real question is whether some factor has been “double-counted”, both as an element of the offence, and as an aggravating circumstance in relation to the offence. It is entirely appropriate for a sentencing judge to note that a particular offence carries an element of moral culpability, whether or not that would generally be so in respect of that offence. While it may frequently be the case that offences of break, enter and steal, are carried out for personal financial gain, that is not a necessary element of the offence and will not inevitably be the case. On the other hand, the fact that other purposes can be envisaged, does not greatly assist in determining whether one circumstance entails greater culpability than another. Does, for example, theft of personal items of sentimental value, with intent to cause grief to the owner, give rise to greater or lesser culpability than theft for financial gain?  
     
      
    11 In oral submissions, counsel for the applicant placed weight on the decision of this Court in Cicciarello v R [2009] NSWCCA 272. That was a case involving a sale or supply of drugs to support an addiction to ‘ice’. Such a case, involving a different offence, would not be of immediate significance were it not for the following statement in the judgment of the Court (Allsop P, McClellan CJ at CL and Fullerton J) at [17]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst one should be careful about generalising in relation to such factors outside the circumstances of any particular case, here, quite clearly, when one understands the background of this young man and what he was doing, he was not selling for greed or for financial gain, he was selling to feed a drug habit that he had acquired. This does not detract from the fact that he committed a serious offence, but what it does mean is that it was an error, and an important one, to characterise this as selling for financial gain and thus to characterise it as an offence falling within the mid-range.” 
        
       
      
    12 This statement must be read in its context. It does not purport to say that an offence committed for financial gain may not involve an element of aggravation, as indeed s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act states. What it does assert is that selling to feed a drug addiction is a factor which does not increase the moral culpability of the offence in the way that it might be increased if financial gain were not otherwise so excused. Nor does it suggest that the fact that the purpose of the offence was to obtain funds to feed a drug habit in any way diminishes the objective seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    13 In the present case, the issue is to identify the correct understanding of her Honour’s remarks. First, there is no basis in law for complaining that the motive was not relevant to culpability and hence to the seriousness of the offence. Nor is there any suggestion that her Honour did not understand that the moral culpability of an addict may be less than that of someone not so afflicted.14 Secondly, it was said that there was no basis to make a finding that financial gain was a purpose of the offence in the present case. That complaint is not easily understood: on the one hand, if financial gain was, as asserted, an inherent characteristic of that class of offence, her Honour could hardly be criticised on a factual basis for drawing the inference that such was the applicant’s purpose. On the other hand, there were passages in the submissions for the applicant which suggested that the finding was erroneous because there was no basis for establishing the value of the property. However, her Honour made no specific finding in that regard, merely “noting” that the items were “of some significant value”. There is no substance in the complaint and, indeed, it is one with which this Court should not have been troubled. 
     
      
    15 It may be that the complaint was really a way of asserting that financial gain was not to be equated with obtaining funds to feed a drug habit, but the two are not mutually incompatible. 
     
      
    Ground 2: proportion of balance of sentence to non-parole period16 Her Honour made a finding of “special circumstances” (about which there is no complaint), which entitled her to fix a sentence involving a non-parole period and balance of the term, where the latter exceeded one-third of the former. Because a non-parole period was fixed only with respect to the second offence, this ground does not operate in respect of the first sentence imposed, which was a fixed term of 18 months. The second sentence was for a period of three years, with a non-parole period of two years, commencing nine months after the commencement of the first sentence.  
     
      
    17 The balance of term of one year was 50% of the non-parole period and could not have been fixed, without a finding of special circumstances. Absent such a finding, her Honour would have been compelled to divide a three year sentence into a non-parole period of two years and three months and a balance of nine months. The imposition of the sentence as so constituted was not in contravention of s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. 
     
      
    18 It is commonplace to treat s 44 as having operation in relation to the aggregate period of imprisonment imposed for a series of offences. It does not. There may of course be an appropriate practice of relating the effective non-parole period to the aggregate term of imprisonment, bearing in mind the statutory proportion specified by s 44. However, that is a practice and not an application of the Sentencing Procedure Act. The distinction is not without significance: where the Act operates, it should be applied in its terms. In relation to a practice, the sentencing judge may enjoy a wider range of flexibility, within which to sentence without appellable error. 
     
      
    19 In order to demonstrate error in this regard, the applicant needed to make good one of two propositions. The first available proposition is that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The second is that the sentence imposed did not give effect to the intentions clearly expressed in the judgment. 
     
      
    20 In respect of the first, no real complaint was made under this ground of manifest excess. In relation to the second potential basis of complaint, it is clear that her Honour correctly understood that the finding of special circumstances was the basis for varying the statutory ratio, which she did. At no point in her judgment did her Honour suggest that she was seeking to adopt some particular proportion between the total period of mandatory imprisonment for the two offences and the period of eligibility for parole. 
     
      
    21 The applicant suggested that her Honour could have relied merely on the circumstance of accumulation if the purpose had been to achieve something equivalent to the statutory ratio for the aggregate period of imprisonment. No doubt that is true, but the fact that she referred to substantive factors which constituted special circumstances does not mean that what she did did not reflect her intention. This ground of appeal was not made good. 
     
      
    Ground 3: offences capable of being dealt with in the Local Court22 The applicant stated, correctly, that the offences in question were capable of being dealt with in the Local Court if the value of the property stolen did not exceed $15,000. It was, however, open to the prosecution to elect to have the matter dealt with on indictment and that course was taken. 
     
      
    23 Reliance was placed upon the remarks in Re Attorney-General’s Application [No 1]; R v Ponfield [1999] NSWCCA 435; 48 NSWLR 327 at [7]-[8], where the Court noted that “the vast proportion of offences [under s 112(1)] … are, and every indication is that they will continue to be, dealt with in the Local Court”. 
     
      
    24 The relevance of that fact is, with respect, obscure. It is true that, in some circumstances, it may be appropriate for a sentencing judge in the District Court to take account of the fact that a particular offence can be disposed of summarily in a Local Court, where the maximum sentence available is two years imprisonment. The relevant authorities in support of that proposition are identified by Johnson J in Regina v El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [29]-[30]. In many cases, especially those involving offences with a maximum penalty (as in this case) of 14 years imprisonment, that factor will have little if any significance. How it might have operated in the present case was not explained. 
     
      
    25 In addition, the possibility that this factor might have had relevance was not drawn to the attention of the sentencing judge. Its relevance being by no means self-evident, it is inappropriate to raise a complaint in this Court that her Honour did not refer to the factor in her judgment. 
     
      
    26 The failure was ultimately relied upon as an indication of error, in support of a conclusion that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Reliance was placed upon El Masri at [45] where Johnson J (Hunt AJA and Hulme J agreeing) stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court functions within well-established jurisdictional boundaries with respect to an application for leave to appeal against sentence, primarily to ascertain whether the decision of the first-instance judge was in error and, if so, in what way it should be corrected:  
        R v Vachalec 
         [1981] 1 NSWLR 351 at 353. In circumstances where the learned sentencing Judge has made no reference to the summary disposal argument in his remarks on sentence, it is necessary to consider whether this omission is indicative of error. One way of testing this proposition is to consider whether the sentence itself appears manifestly excessive in all the circumstances of the case - if the factor had been taken into account and given appropriate weight, a substantially lesser sentence was appropriate in this case.” 
        
       
      
    27 Those comments must be understood in the context of a sentence which the Court considered was “manifestly excessive”: at [46]. That being so, the cause of the error did not need to be identified; nor was it. In the present case, the complaint was that the sentencing judge commenced with a sentence of four years, before allowing a reduction of 25% on account of an early plea of guilty. 
     
      
    28 That sentence was imposed in respect of an offence which took place at a dwelling house which was empty at the time of entry, but in circumstances where the applicant was literally caught in the act of carrying out the offence and was required to physically free himself from the grasp from one of the occupants, in order to escape.  
     
      
    29 Given his criminal record, and the fact that he was on parole, a significant emphasis needed to be placed on personal deterrence as well as on the absence of any mitigating factor which might be found resulting from an isolated lapse into criminality. 
     
      
    30 No case was made to demonstrate that a sentence of three years imprisonment, including a non-parole period of two years imprisonment, was outside the appropriate range for the offence in question, given the maximum penalty available. 
     
      
    Conclusion31 No error has been shown on the part of the sentencing judge in imposing the respective sentences for the two offences. Nor has it been demonstrated that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    32 Were it not for the need to give a direction in relation to the period to be served on parole, this application would give rise to a question as to whether there were any substantial basis upon which it could be pursued. If there were not, it would usually be appropriate to refuse leave to appeal. However, it is not necessary to determine whether the case falls within that category.  
     
      
    33 The proposed orders of the Court are: 
     
      
       
      (1) Grant the applicant leave to appeal in respect of each of the sentences imposed by Ashford DCJ in the District Court at Parramatta on 1 December 2008. 
       
       
      (2) In relation to the second sentence, direct that the applicant be released on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period. 
       
       
      (3) Otherwise dismiss the appeal. 
       
      
    34 HOWIE J: I agree with the orders proposed by the Presiding Judge for the reasons given by his Honour. I wish merely to make a comment upon the second ground of appeal. The second ground raises a complaint that frequently appears before this Court and arises where there have been sentences imposed which are to be served wholly or partially cumulative with one another. It concerns the relationship between the aggregate or effective term of imprisonment to be served and the aggregate or effective non-parole period applying to that term. 
     
      
    35 For my part I do not see any inconsistency between the practice that has been adopted in this Court in applying the statutory ratio to an aggregate or effective non-parole period and the terms of s 44. In my opinion a judge is required in a case such as the present to consider the relationship between the period to be served before parole eligibility arising from the accumulation of the two sentences and the balance of the term of the sentence for the second offence in order to ensure a sufficient period of parole supervision.  
     
      
    36 It may be necessary to find special circumstances and reduce the non-parole period imposed on the second offence to bring about that result. This has been conventional sentencing practice in this State since at least 1992: see R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58. However, the ultimate question to be asked is what is the least period the offender is required to serve before being eligible for parole? The answer to that question will depend upon a consideration of all the purposes of punishment and not simply the rehabilitation of the offender.  
     
      
    37 The ground is not made out in this case because her Honour did in fact find special circumstances in relation to the second offence and reduced the non-parole period accordingly. The effective non-parole period is slightly less than that which would follow upon an application of the statutory relationship. In this particular case, however, having regard to the applicant’s record and the fact that he was on parole, a judge would have been justified in imposing an effective non-parole period that exceeded the statutory relationship. This her Honour did not do and the applicant in my view was fortunate that the Judge took the course that she did. 
     
      
    38 Like the Presiding Judge I am not persuaded that the result is not what her Honour intended nor am I persuaded that any lesser period of incarceration before release to parole is warranted. 
     
      
    39 HISLOP J: I agree with Justice Howie. 
     
      
    40 BASTEN JA: The orders of the Court therefore are as I have indicated.

    JUDGMENT1. On 5 May 2009 police executed a search warrant on a premises at Byrne Street, South Granville. These were premises leased by Andy Nguyen for $300 per week. The search uncovered a small but sophisticated hydroponic set-up harnessed for cultivation of marijuana plants. Four of the rooms with nine or ten high powered globes housed half metre shades and varying numbers of cannabis plants. In total there were ninety-seven plants being cultivated. Also seized were; four power boards, thirty-five electrical transformers, five carbon filters, ten pedestal fans. Five of the plants were fifteen centimetres high, the remaining ninety-two were approximately one metre in length.2. There was evidence indicative of a recently harvested crop. There were also a number of juvenile plants in the process of cultivating as though for future stock and there was eighty grams of cannabis secured in the fridge. 3. Today Andy Nguyen is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct in cultivating those ninety-seven plants and other S166 Criminal Procedure Act matters that arise from that cultivation. As sentencing judge it falls to me to determine the appropriate sentence for this criminality before this community by this offender. Further Facts4. The premises at Byrne Street were apparently heavily fortified with steel bars and shutters. The premises were rented. There is nothing in the evidence before me that establishes that this offender erected or caused to be erected the steel bars and shutters; nor that it was a deal maker in his selection of these premises to lease. In my view the state of the exterior of the premises will not add or detract from the criminality involved in the cultivation. It presents simply as a neutral.5. The offender readily admitted watering and growing the ninety-seven plants. I am satisfied he also fertilised them and remained at the premises, at least in part, to keep the crop secure. The electricity coming into the premises had been bypassed via the main electrical metre box. That means that he was using illegal means to aid his cultivation. While it is true that he has been charged with stealing the electricity it also aggravates the criminality of the cultivation.6. The potential street value of the cannabis seized is said to be approximately $470,700. My understanding is that this valuation is based upon a per plant figure which on my calculation is $4,850 per plant. For that potential to be fulfilled the plants would need to have been mature, well laden and disease free. I do not understand the agreed facts to concede the cultivation seized by police was in fact worth that sum and I find it was worth substantially less. Nonetheless the potential value is a further factor in persuading me, as will be seen shortly, that the cultivation was not about debt repayment but rather it was about income stream. Those comments will become more clear in a moment. 7. I am satisfied the product of the cultivation was to be sold for financial gain and that it was to be his main source of income. Indeed he had given up his employment in order to pursue cultivation of the plant. In his interview with police the offender claimed he needed to pay debts. He told David Green, psychologist, retained by the defence, that he was a gambler who gambled on poker machines. That he developed a relationship with a Vietnamese/Chinese man who would offer him money to continue gambling. After he had lost his own money he apparently gambled seven days per week. Michael, the Vietnamese/Chinese man, was lending him $300 at a time until one day Michael told the offender that he owed $22,000 and wanted the money repaid. Assuming for the moment that he was paid $300 each day he gambled, that would have taken more than seventy days to reach the sum of $22,000. It also assumes that he never had a winning day in that period. Unable to repay the money he owed to Michael, Michael told him to resign as a baker and cultivate the crop, which he did. 8. In my court I have sentenced several Vietnamese offenders who give an almost identical account. As with many of the others this offender did not enter the witness box. His account is untested. I am not prepared to find that the accused responded to any person’s demands to undertake the task of cultivating marijuana plants. In sentencing matters, anything favourable, or mitigating the offence, is required to be approved by the offender through evidence somehow or other, not necessarily from the offender, on the balance of probabilities. 9. As the evidence presently stands, as I say, I am not prepared to find he responded to any person’s demands to undertake that task. That is not to say I reject the offender's account that he is a gambler or that he may well have debts to repay. The fact that this offender has given up work to focus on the cultivation is consistent with an intent to use the marijuana harvest as an income stream. The fact that there has been a prior harvest is also consistent with his using the proceeds as an income stream rather than a debt reduction to Michael. Indeed, so far as I am aware he may have already reduced his debt to Michael as a consequence of the first cultivation. Indeed there is no mention of debt reduction or an exit strategy once his debt is repaid, again consistent with an income stream rather than debt reduction to Michael. The impression one gets is that the arrangement in Byrne Street was meant to be an ongoing operation and not just an operation for the sake of extinguishing debt. Objective Criminality10. When assessing objective criminality in drug matters the primary focus is to concentrate upon the potential for harm to the community. Drug dealing and therefore drug cultivation are crimes against the public health. Drug addicts are persons whose capacity to function as healthy motivated human beings is smothered to a greater or lesser extent by addiction. Also associated with drug use are diseases such as HIV, hepatitis because of lack of hygiene in sharing drugs. And while the risk is much more minimal in terms of cannabis use there is still the exchanging of cigarettes, bongs, and the like, where saliva residue from one person can easily be transferred to another. Hydroponic cultivation is a means of enhanced cultivation. Enhanced has three aspects: quicker growing time; more heavily laden plants and improved potency of the cannabis drug. All of these are factors impacting adversely upon the public health. 11. The link between marijuana consumption and serious mental health issues including paranoia, aggression and schizophrenia is now well established. Of course the enhanced form of the cultivation carries its own penalties and lower barriers for commercial and large commercial quantities. It is not therefore an aggravating feature of this offence but an element of it. 12. The operation was small, housed in four rooms. I find the motivation was for an income stream, that is, for the financial gain of the offender. He is not a cannabis user. He tried it once and did not like it.  13. There is no evidence he was locked into any distribution network. I am satisfied his involvement in the cultivation was recent, but there has been at least one harvest prior to his arrest. The size of the previous harvest is unknown but the current crop is likely to represent an expansion upon his earlier efforts. While I am unable to say he personally, actually himself, (pardon the tautology) installed the lighting, or personally bypassed the electricity mains, which were indeed bypassed, I am satisfied he either did so or authorised or caused these things to be done. I am satisfied he supplied or found the capital necessary to purchase the shades, globes, power boards, transformers and carbon filters. I am satisfied he purchased the initial stock of cannabis plants and thereafter used them to enlarge his own stock plants. 14. Eighty grams of cannabis, as I said earlier, were located in the freezer. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he had it for the purpose of supply, although it is likely because he claims to the Probation and Parole he did not like using cannabis himself. I should make it clear that because I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of this he is not treated as having it in his possession for the purpose of supply. I think it likely, I am highly suspicious, but I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. I am satisfied the cultivation of the ninety-seven plants demonstrates sufficient objective criminality as to require a substantial prison sentence.Subjective Matters15. I come to the subjective features. Not only am I sentencing for the criminality involved in the growing of the ninety-seven plants but I am sentencing this particular offender for that crime. Matters personal to him may have some impact upon the sentencing outcome. His past background, history, health and the like may indicate that a greater or a lesser sentence should be imposed. Family Dynamics, Background and Relationship16. Andy Nguyen was born in Hanoi Vietnam in 1975. He emigrated to Australia in 1997. His father was a university lecturer in descriptive geometry and his mother held a management position within the Vietnamese government. His parents owned a small business selling stationery goods until their retirement. There is one brother who is two years older residing in Vietnam, working as an architect. Mr Nguyen says the family is poor. 17. He met his first wife in 1999, she was a year older than he and had two children from a previous relationship. They married in February of 2000. He cared for her and her children, at least initially. Subsequently he began to drift away from the relationship. He liked to meet friends for cups of coffee after he had finished work and talk with them. From his perspective his wife was demanding, protesting vigorously when he spent time with friends. He sees his wife as jealous and insecure and she accused him of having a relationship with other women. Her criticisms led to arguments and ultimately, in 2002, she asked him to leave the family home. She was pregnant at that time with a son who was born in March of 2003. The offender has not seen the former wife and her children since 2002. It follows he has not seen his son since that time either. 18. In 2002 he commenced a relationship with his now current partner, and two children aged six and three are born from that union. That relationship ended in 2008 due to Nguyen’s ongoing issues surrounding gambling. Of course whilst he has been in custody he has not been gambling so he and his partner have now reconciled. It is his intention to be with her upon his release. In that union there is a son, Tim, who, as I understand it is the younger son, still at pre-school. He has a speech difficulty, some of which may be reactive to the absence of the father, although the child seems to have had late developmental milestones. 19. An assessment of the boy was done by Minh Nguyet Nguyen, a speech pathologist with The Gift of Speech organisation. Her assessment was that based on observations with the clinic and in the pre-school setting, it was determined that Tim had a language delay, particularly in his expressive language area. He was not consistently using two or three word sentences to talk about what he was doing or to request for things. Tim was seen to be predominantly using gestures as a mean of communicating across both settings. His language skills were found to be severely delayed compared with his peers. His English skills are not developing due to the language delay in Vietnamese. His receptive language skills need to be monitored further. 20. The speech pathologist made a number of recommendations, there is no evidence before me whether any of those recommendations have been pursued or how seriously the family take the matter. Fiona Doan writes in a document tendered on behalf of the accused, “Our youngest child requires a lot of care as he has slow speech. I have taken him to the doctors so that they can help him overcome his problem.”Education21. Andy Nguyen completed his high school education in Vietnam. He did not experience any academic concerns but missed long periods of school due to ill health. Aged twenty-one or twenty-two he came to Australia to complete an English course. He studied English and business studies at the Strathfield International College and the Alpha Beta College Sydney for about two and a half years. He completed the English course and partially completed the business course, claiming that when he ceased study he did because he needed to support his then partner and her children. Between 2003 and 2008 he was employed continually in the same firm as a baker. In fact his first full-time job in Sydney had been at the fish markets in February of 2000 where he worked twelve hours a day, six days a week. He left that, unable to cope with those work hours and then began as a baker in Epping and worked there. 22. He ceased employment in 2008 when he commenced being the caretaker of the cannabis plants that are the subject of this offence. He has an offer of employment at the Bake ‘n’ Break bakery in Singleton run by Thi Huong Nguyen. General Health23. While I note he missed significant amounts of school through health problems, his partner reports he has stomach problems which affect his daily lifestyle and eating requirements. She says custody will be hard for him because of his dietary needs. Mental Health Issues24. David Green reports extensively on a history given to him by the offender touching background, family dynamics, relationship history, education, career moves, history of offence, degree of contrition, and potential for rehabilitation. He also takes a gambling history. Mr Green says:  
     
      
      “Mr Nguyen described symptoms of mood disorder including depressed mood, anergia, anhedonia, social withdrawal, sleep appetite, concentration and libido disturbance. There was poor self esteem and some suicide ideation. He had difficulty concentrating at work and said he had burnt himself frequently on the ovens. He said he stopped caring about his life and began looking for places to enjoy.” 
       
      
    So far as I can tell there has been no psychological testing administered. In his comment and opinion Mr Green says: 
     
      
      “It is my opinion based on Mr Nguyen’s self report that he experienced a mood disorder, major depressive episode (using DSM/4 criteria) following the breakdown of his relationship with his wife. The circumstances of the breakdown and the fact that he has not been able to contact his wife, her children and his newborn son proved devastating for him and are in my opinion the significant contributor towards his depressed mood... 
       
       It is my opinion Mr Nguyen experienced a psychiatric disorder pathological gambling (using DSM/4 criteria) and I note his symptoms include chasing his losses. Obsessive thinking about gambling. A belief that he would inevitably win money from gambling, and an emotive wanting to get revenge from a machine after a large loss.” 
       
      
    Expert opinion evidence should be presented in such a way as to explain the reasoning process. It would have been far more satisfactory if Mr Green had set out the criteria for each disorder he has diagnosed and explained which of the selections apply in this case. Having said that I accept that it is probable the offender does have a gambling problem and does experience depressed moods. The offender told Probation and Parole that for three years now his gambling has been an addiction, he claims in the two years prior to his arrest he had been at a local gambling club daily.25. He told Mr Green that he liked gambling and thought about gambling constantly. He would hear the music of the machines in his head and was impatient to finish work so he could attend a club and gamble. He would attend a club after work from about 10am to 6pm, return home for a few hours sleep and then attend work.26. He also said that he was focused on gambling, that he reduced his consumption of alcohol as it interfered with the time he could spend gambling. He also said he was “chasing the losses” and “genuinely believed it was possible to win large sums of money”.27. That account has one inconsistency insofar as I am concerned. He is a baker, most bakers have started their baking well and truly by 6am. Mr Nguyen has himself arriving home for a few hours sleep at that time. I am also prepared to accept that his desire to fund gambling and repay debts constituted some part of the offender’s motivation for growing the cannabis.28. As with most ventures for financial gain motivation is no one single focus driver, there are other things that financial gain can be spent upon, such as cars and other aspects of lifestyle.Character29. This offender presents as a person of prior good character. He is thirty-four years of age, one of his referees describes him as having a good work ethic.Contrition30. He told police and Mr Green that he was sorry for his involvement. To Mr Green he was able to personalise his contrition through insight into the impact cannabis/drugs had had upon his soul mate. I accept that he is genuinely contrite. His partner says he has told her of his remorse when she visits and speaks to him on the phone.Plea of Guilty31. He was committed for sentence on 9 July 2009, having pleaded before the Parramatta Local Court. I am prepared to give him the full benefit for the utilitarian value of his plea.Rehabilitation32. There are a number of positive rehabilitation indicators: 
     
      
       
       Has support of his partner and presumably a home to return to. 
       Has expressed contrition in terms that demonstrate some insight into the public health consequence of drug abuse. 
       Has linked his criminal behaviour to his gambling addiction, again demonstrating insight. 
       Had a good work ethic when in the community and an offer of employment upon his release. 
       
      
    All of these factors suggest rehabilitation may be positive for him. The real test emerges, however, when released back into the community. Should he resume sustained gambling he will certainly return to crime. Probation and Parole should supervise him, monitor closely his predilection to gambling and require him to attend counselling and Gamblers Anonymous for the duration of the parole.33. I do not regard requiring him to attend Gamblers Anonymous as onerous, I am told and accept that he has a capacity to understand English and would not be, as it were, sitting with a group of people simply to occupy his time. I am satisfied there is much he could get from attending such a meeting.Setting the Sentence34. I have spoken of the capacity for harm to public health arising from enhanced cannabis production. This is a case where punishment forms an underpinning platform of the sentencing. Where there is punishment and in particular where that punishment requires incarceration, there is necessarily present both general and personal deterrence for other would be offenders.35. I have had regard to four recent Court of Criminal Appeal cases when setting the sentence for this offence. Pham v The Queen (2009) NSWCCA 266, Mack v The Queen (2009) NSWCCA 216, Nguyen v The Queen (2009) NSWCCA 181 and R v Van Cuong Nguyen (2008) NSWCCA 322.36. I note that of our research in respect of somewhere between eighty and one hundred and so plants, 112 plants, that three of the four cases that I have referred to are of Vietnamese. 37. This is Andy Nguyen’s first time in custody. It will be difficult for him not only because of the loss of liberty involved but because he has a needy family outside the prison walls, particularly his second son. It is also said he has special dietary needs.38. As matters presently stand the evidence is silent on the capacity of Corrective Services to cater for his needs. Their nature and extent have not been properly disclosed in evidence in any medical evidence before me.39. Balancing the objective seriousness of his criminal conduct, the subjective history and the 21A matters, an overall sentence of three and-a-half years is called for.40. I would discount that, as I said, on account of his earlier plea by twenty-five per cent which makes a discount of ten and-a-half months, giving an overall sentence now of thirty one and-a-half months. 41. In setting the minimum term and balance of term, I have determined to find special circumstances. The matters which have persuaded me that special circumstances are appropriate is firstly the rehabilitation in the community, particularly in respect of gambling control and his participation in community based support through Gamblers Anonymous. Secondly, the need to reintegrate into family life, quite possibly in the Hunter region where the position of employment has been offered to him.42. Would you stand up please, Mr Nguyen. Andy Nguyen, you are convicted that you, on the fifth day of May 2009 at South Granville in the State of New South Wales did cultivate a number of prohibited plants, namely ninety-seven cannabis plants which amounts to no less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited plant. 43. I note the maximum penalty for that offence is one of fifteen years imprisonment. I sentence you to a non-parole period of sixteen and one half months, commencing on 5 May 2009 and expiring on 4 September 2010. A balance of term expiring on 4 December 2011. I’m assuming those figures are right. Because the sentence is less than three years I can make an order in respect of your parole and I order that you be subject to supervision by Probation and Parole and that you attend such counselling and treatment as directed by your case manager with Probation and Parole, I commend to the Probation and Parole serious consideration of requiring you to attend gambling counselling and to attend weekly meetings, at least twice weekly, of Gamblers Anonymous. Any other order that I need to make? Drugs I suppose need to be destroyed do they?BROWN: That’s correct your Honour. HIS HONOUR: I make an order requiring the drugs to be destroyed. Any other orders?NGUYEN: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right. Thank you. They’re not Form 1 but they must be 166 matters. The back-up offence, that’s to be withdrawn is it Madam Crown?BROWN: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I give leave to the Crown to withdraw that. There should be some - yes, possess prohibited drug cannabis.44. In respect of the possessing prohibited drug cannabis, eighty grams of that, I set a sentence of four months to date from 5 May 2009 and to expire on 4 October 2009. In respect of the use and consume/waste electricity without authority, I’m going to set a sentence of four months imprisonment to date from 5 October 2009 and to expire on 4 February 2010.45. So those sentences, both will be concurrent with the sixteen and-a-half months, you’ll be due for release and I order your release on 4 February 2010. Mr Nguyen you will be released on 19 September 2010 next year. Thank you.

     Headnote 
     
     
      
    As the result of an incident that took place on the night of 8 March 2008, the appellant was charged on indictment with attempting to have sexual intercourse with an identified woman, without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting, an offence arising under s 61P of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The incident arose following a party at the appellant's house, in the course of which the complainant had become intoxicated and had been helped by a friend to the bedroom used by the appellant and his wife and placed on the bed. Later, the appellant, also highly intoxicated, had gone to the bedroom, undressed and attempted to have intercourse with the complainant who was both intoxicated and asleep. When the friend of the complainant who had helped her to the room came in, she found the appellant lying on top of the complainant, who was lying on her stomach still asleep. The appellant apologised and explained that he thought the complainant was his wife. On 3 August 2009, after the appellant had been arraigned and pleaded not guilty, but before the jury was empanelled, English DCJ heard submissions on two matters of potential legal significance: first, the application of s 61HA of the Crimes Act, dealing with knowledge about consent in relation to this and other related offences; and second, because there was evidence of the appellant's intoxication at the time of the offence, whether the offence charged was an ""offence of specific intent"" within the terms of s 428B of the Crimes Act. Her Honour delivered a judgment in which held that the offence was not a crime of specific intent, and that the provisions of s 61HA applied. The appellant sought an adjournment to allow an appeal to be brought against this judgment, which her Honour granted, further issuing a certificate under s 5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) permitting such an appeal. The issues for determination on appeal were:(i) whether the Court's jurisdiction under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act was engaged; and if so:(ii) whether s 61HA of the Crimes Act applied to the offence, and (iii) whether the attempt was an offence of specific intent.The Court held, dismissing the appeal (per Basten JA, Fullerton and McCallum JJ agreeing):In relation to (i)1. Although the judgment would have consequences in respect of the admissibility of evidence at a later stage in the trial, it was not in terms a ruling on the admissibility of specific evidence. Rather, it should be characterised as a preliminary determination of certain questions of law which were anticipated as likely to arise in the course of the proceedings: [30].2 The mechanisms by which legal issues can be determined prior to the commencement of a trial are relevant to the scope of s 5F. Those mechanisms include the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 192A, the District Court Rules 1973 (NSW), Pt 53, rr 10 and 11, and the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), s 130A. None of these provisions has the effect of widening the scope of s 5F so as to encompass an appeal from an interlocutory judgment in the current circumstances: [24]–[36], [39], [42], [55]–[56].

    3. The fact that advance rulings on matters of law may affect the outcome of the trial does not provide a sufficient basis for permitting an interlocutory appeal. If an appeal were available in such circumstances, many rulings on evidence and disputed directions to the jury would become the potential subjects of interlocutory appeals. The phrase ""interlocutory judgment or order"" in s 5F does not extend so far: [27]–[29], [58]–[60].

    In relation to (ii)4. There is a degree of ambiguity as to the operation of s 61HA. It does not in its terms apply to attempts to commit specified offences. It is a possible construction that the provision would operate because, in order to establish the offence of attempt, the prosecution would need to make good the elements of the substantive offence. However the provision curtails the rights of an accused under the general law, and this construction does not reach the level of clarity required to overcome the textual support for the non-operation of s 61HA in respect of attempts to commit the identified substantive offences: [78]–[80].

     W O v DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (NSW) 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: As the result of an incident which took place on the night of 8 March 2008, the appellant was charged on indictment with attempting to have sexual intercourse with an identified woman, without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting. The charge arose under s 61P of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), which renders a person attempting to commit one of a number of specified substantive offences liable to the same penalty as that provided for the substantive offence. The substantive offence in this case arose under s 61I of the Crimes Act. (The name of the appellant has been anonymised because the criminal proceedings remain on foot.)2 Two matters of potential legal significance arose in relation to the charge. First, there was a question as to the application of a provision of the Crimes Act dealing with knowledge about consent in relation to this and other related offences: Crimes Act, s 61HA. Secondly, because there was evidence of the appellant’s intoxication at the time of the offence, a question arose as to whether the offence charged was an “offence of specific intent” within the terms of s 428B of the Crimes Act. If it were not such an offence, self-induced intoxication could not be taken into account in determining whether the appellant had the relevant intention. 
     
      
    3 On 3 August 2009, after the appellant had been arraigned and pleaded not guilty, but before the jury was empanelled, the trial judge (English DCJ) heard submissions from both counsel for the Director and counsel for the appellant. Precisely what was put to her Honour and what her Honour was invited to do is a matter which is in contention. However, on 4 August 2009 her Honour delivered a judgment in which she expressly stated that: 
     
      
       
      (a) the offence is not a crime of specific intent, and 
       
      (b) the provisions of s 61HA apply. 
       
       
      Her Honour also stated that the “application to have the defence excluded is upheld”: Judgment, p 5. 
       
      
    4 Following delivery of the judgment, counsel for the appellant sought an adjournment in order to allow an appeal to be brought against her Honour’s ruling. Counsel for the Director did not oppose the application, which was granted. Her Honour also stated (Tcpt, 4/8/2009, p 15 (45)): 
     
      
       
        
        “I think you need my leave under s 5F … but I’m certainly willing to grant leave for there to be an appeal as the issue has never been judicially considered as far as I could determine.” 
        
       
      
    5 A certificate under s 5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) was signed by the trial judge on 6 August 2009 and was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “I hereby certify that the annexed judgment is a proper one for the determination on Appeal by the Court of Criminal Appeal upon the following ground:” 
        
       
       
      No ground was specified. 
       
      
    6 The notice of appeal, which together with the certificate was filed on 17 August 2009, identified the judgment or order appealed against in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Attempted sexual intercourse without consent … is not a crime of specific intent.” 
        
       
       
        
        “The provisions of s 61(h)(a) [sic] apply. The application to have the defence excluded is upheld.” 
        
       
      
    7 In written submissions, senior counsel for the appellant conceded that “[b]oth the procedure adopted and the ruling given are beset with … problems”. Nevertheless, he submitted that the Court had power to deal with the appeal under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
     
      
    8 In the event that the Court held otherwise, he took the precautionary step of filing in the Court of Appeal a summons for judicial review under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). That summons has been listed together with the criminal appeal, and is dealt with in a separate judgment. 
     
      
    9 Although the Director had, in an informal manner, sought the rulings of the trial judge in respect of the matters which are now in contention, and had not objected to an adjournment to allow her Honour’s rulings to be challenged on appeal, he disputed the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the appeal under s 5F. Senior counsel for the Director also filed submissions in the civil proceedings, contending that there was “no judgment or order made or given that is amenable to the relief sought”. 
     
      
    10 In order to consider the jurisdictional issues, it is necessary to explain briefly what happened before her Honour. 
     
      
    Procedural background11 At the commencement of the trial on 3 August 2009, the prosecutor indicated that there was “just one matter that needs to be ventilated”: Tcpt, p 2(5). After clarification with respect to the availability of interpreters, and after noting the charges on the indictment, counsel for the Director continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I understand there is an issue in the trial that whether or not the accused has a defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact. And as I understand the position that is the defence that he’s been putting forward in his record of interview to police and I think … that was the defence that he intended to rely on in the trial. What the Crown says is that because of the amendments to the  
        Crimes Act 
        , s 61HA that occurred on 1 January 2008, that defence simply isn’t open to the accused in this trial.” 
        
       
      
    12 The prosecutor then outlined the facts, by way of “background”. The incident in question arose following a party at the appellant’s house, in the course of which one of the guests (the complainant) had become intoxicated and had been helped by a friend to the bedroom used by the appellant and his wife and placed on the bed. Later that evening, the appellant who was also highly intoxicated, had gone to his bedroom, undressed and attempted to have sexual intercourse with the complainant who was, at the time, both intoxicated and asleep. When the female friend of the complainant who had helped her to the bedroom, came in she found the appellant lying on top of the complainant, who was lying on her stomach and was still asleep. The appellant apologised and explained that he thought the complainant was his wife. The prosecutor continued (Tcpt, p 4(5)): 
     
      
       
        
        “It’s on that factual scenario that I understand [the appellant] to be arguing that the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact, that being that the complainant was in fact the accused[’s] wife, is raised and something that must be rebutted by the Crown in the course of the trial.” 
        
       
      
    13 The prosecutor then outlined the elements of the offence and referred specifically to s 61HA(3)(c). It is convenient to set out the relevant parts of s 61HA: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        61HA Consent in relation to sexual assault offences 
         
        (1)  
        Offences to which section applies 
         
          
          This section applies for the purposes of the offences under sections 61I, 61J and 61JA. 
          
         
        … 
         
        (3)  
        Knowledge about consent 
         
          
          A person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse if:  
           
          (a) the person knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse, or 
           
          (b) the person is reckless as to whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, or 
           
          (c) the person has no reasonable grounds for believing that the other person consents to the sexual intercourse. 
           
          For the purpose of making any such finding, the trier of fact must have regard to all the circumstances of the case:  
           
          (d) including any steps taken by the person to ascertain whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, but 
           
          (e) not including any self-induced intoxication of the person. 
          
         
        (4)  
        Negation of consent 
         
          
          A person does not consent to sexual intercourse:  
           
          … 
           
          (b) if the person does not have the opportunity to consent to the sexual intercourse because the person is unconscious or asleep, … 
          
         
        (6) The grounds on which it may be established that a person does not consent to sexual intercourse include:  
         
          
          (a) if the person has sexual intercourse while substantially intoxicated by alcohol or any drug, … 
          
         
        (8) This section does not limit the grounds on which it may be established that a person does not consent to sexual intercourse.” 
        
       
      
    14 The prosecutor, having referred to the terms of sub-s (3) and sub-s (4)(b), continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “So if I can then move to what the Crown sees as the common law in relation to the defence of an honest and reasonable mistake. It’s always in the Crown’s submission [been] the case that ‘at common law an honest and reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances which [if] true would make the act for which the prisoner is indicted an innocent act.’” 
        
       
      
    15 The prosecutor made reference to the English authority of R v Tolson (1889) 23 QBD 168 and the decision of the High Court in CTM v The Queen [2008] HCA 25; 236 CLR 440. From those authorities, the prosecutor derived two propositions relating to the “defence” of honest and reasonable mistake of fact. As the plurality noted in CTM, the characterisation of a “defence” was better described as “a ground of exculpation”, as to which an evidentiary burden lay upon an accused, but which ultimately the prosecution bore the legal onus of displacing: at [8]. The term “defence” as used in the argument and judgment in the District Court should be understood in its colloquial sense and not as a term of art indicating where the legal onus of proof lay. In this context, the prosecutor asserted, first, that the availability of such a ground of exculpation depended upon the particular statutory scheme. Secondly, he submitted that the fact mistakenly believed by the accused must be such as to take his conduct outside the scope of criminality, so as to render it an “innocent” act. The prosecution case was that the statutory regime, and in particular s 61HA(3), rendered the common law defence “unnecessary” because all the relevant matters were stated in the statute: Tcpt, p 6(40)-(45). That submission was extended, after reference to the second reading speech of 7 November 2007 in relation to the new section, so that the final position put by the prosecutor was that a defence under the common law was unavailable, given the terms of s 61HA(3)(c): Tcpt, p 7(45). 
     
      
    16 It is apparent from this summary that the prosecutor did not raise as an issue for preliminary consideration whether the offence was one of specific intent. That issue was raised by counsel for the appellant (Tcpt, p 8(10)-(15)) and was addressed in reply by the prosecutor: Tcpt, p 9. 
     
      
    17 The prosecutor did not object to the issue as to whether the offence charged was one of specific intent being raised in this manner: indeed, he treated the issue as requiring a resolution of two provisions, by giving priority to the operation of s 61HA: Tcpt, p 13. Counsel for the appellant, by contrast, identified the application of s 61HA and the issue as to whether the offence was one of specific intent as being separate and independent of each other: Tcpt, p 14. 
     
      
    18 On 4 August 2009 the trial judge delivered what is described as a “judgment”. The judgment did not identify an issue raised by the prosecution for determination but noted that: 
     
      
       
        
        “[t]he accused seeks to raise as a defence, an honest and reasonable belief as to the identity of the complainant and argues that the provisions of s 61(H)(A) [sic] do not apply. The accused admits, as I understand the facts of the case to be, that he was highly intoxicated and he thought it was his wife who was in his bed at the relevant time. That he has an honest and mistaken belief as to the identity of the person in his bed”: pp 1-2. 
        
       
      
    19 Her Honour further stated at pp 4-5: 
     
      
       
        
        “Of course, if it was his wife in bed, who was asleep or unconscious or incapable of consenting due to a level of intoxication, he would have no such defence. 
        
       
       
        
        The issue to be determined, as I see it, is whether the offence of attempted sexual intercourse without consent is a crime of specific intent.” 
        
       
      
    20 Having posed the issue in that way, her Honour held that it was not a crime of specific intent and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “That being so, his level of intoxication is not a relevant consideration and inadmissible in respect of his intention and he is precluded from relying upon intoxication as some kind of a defence to the substantive act. 
        
       
       
        
        The provisions of s 61(H)(A) apply. The application to have the defence excluded is upheld.” 
        
       
      
    Jurisdiction of the Court21 The appeal to this Court is brought under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act, which, so far as relevant, reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        5F Appeal against interlocutory judgment or order 
         
          
          (1) This section applies to:  
           
            
            (a) proceedings … for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court or in the District Court …. 
            
           
          (2) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings to which this section applies. 
           
          (3) Any other party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings:  
           
            
            (a) if the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal, or 
             
            (b) if the judge or magistrate of the court of trial certifies that the judgment or order is a proper one for determination on appeal. 
            
           
          (3A) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case. 
           
          … 
           
          (5) The Court of Criminal Appeal:  
           
            
            (a) may affirm or vacate the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against, and 
             
            (b) if it vacates the judgment, order, decision or ruling, may give or make some other judgment, order, decision or ruling instead of the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against. 
            
           
          (6) If leave to appeal under this section is refused by the Court of Criminal Appeal, the refusal does not preclude any other appeal following a conviction on the matter to which the refused application for leave to appeal related.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    22 The present appeal is brought pursuant to sub-s 5F(3), not being an appeal brought by the Attorney-General or the Director. The trial judge having certified that the judgment or order is a proper one for determination on appeal, there is no occasion for this Court to consider whether or not to grant leave to appeal. 
     
      
    23 The grant of the certificate by the trial judge was not necessary, as her Honour appears to have believed, in order for the application to proceed. Rather, the act of the trial judge in certifying under sub-s (3)(b) effectively removes from this Court the power to control, through grant or refusal of leave to appeal, its own procedures. As this Court indicated in Pellegrino v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2008] NSWCCA 17; 71 NSWLR 96 at [8], it is “usually desirable that leave be sought in this Court”. The Court continued at [9]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The power of the trial judge to certify may properly be exercised in circumstances where the appropriateness of an interlocutory appeal is not in doubt and particularly where that factor is combined with lack of opposition from the Director. Similarly, it may properly be exercised where the trial judge feels that he or she has obtained a particular insight into the proceedings which may not readily be shared by this Court. In other cases caution should be exercised ….” 
        
       
      
    24 One consideration which supports that approach is that where an appeal is available under s 5F, there may nevertheless be discretionary reasons for declining to grant leave, including factors relating to the interruption of criminal proceedings and the possibility that intervention might be premature. In such a case, the position of the applicant will be protected by sub-s 5F(6). If the question of leave does not arise, because the trial judge has certified that the matter is an appropriate one for an appeal, there may be consequences as to the bases on which a conviction can be challenged. No such issue arises for determination in the present case: rather, this is merely an occasion for emphasising the need for caution on the part of trial judges in considering whether to certify a matter under sub-s (3)(b). 
     
      
    Scope of s 5F(3)25 The jurisdiction of the Court depends on the scope of the phrase “interlocutory judgment or order” in s 5F(3), a phrase which does not readily lend itself to precise delimitation. 
     
      
    26 Although particular words must be construed in their statutory context, the fact that the words adopted by the legislature have an established history of legal usage is not to be disregarded: see The King v Snow [1915] HCA 90; 20 CLR 315 at 321-322 (Griffiths CJ). Thus, it was not inapt for this Court, in Bozatsis & Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim 296 at 303, to refer to The Commonwealth v Mullane [1961] HCA 28; 106 CLR 166 at 169, dismissing as outside the terms of s 73 of the Constitution a purported appeal from a ruling by a trial judge as to the effect of a certificate in particular proceedings: see also Lethlean (1995) 83 A Crim R 197 at 205-206 (Sheller JA, Allen and Hulme JJ agreeing); cf Salter v Director of Public Prosecutions [2009] NSWCA 357 at [17] (Spigelman CJ, McColl and Campbell JJA agreeing) and [32](Campbell JA) . 
     
      
    27 The phrase “interlocutory judgment or order” is also to be found in s 101 of the Supreme Court Act, dealing with the subject matter of appeals to the Court of Appeal. Leave is required in relation to an appeal from an interlocutory judgment or order: s 101(2)(e). (The precursor to this provision was s 31(1)(i) of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act 1925 (UK), which referred to appeals from “any interlocutory order or interlocutory judgment”.) Under that provision, rulings as to evidence given in the course of a trial, while concededly interlocutory, have been held not to give rise to a judgment or order which may be the subject of appeal: see Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Company (Canberra) Ltd [1996] NSWCA 14 at p 3(5) (Mahoney P, Meagher JA agreeing); Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2005] NSWCA 233; 54 ACSR 365 at [19]-[25]. This Court has reached a similar conclusion in respect of rulings on evidence, namely that such rulings, made in advance of or in the course of a trial, are not within the scope of s 5F: see R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 at 639G (Hunt CJ at CL, Grove and Sharpe JJ). The reasoning of the Court commenced with the proposition that a judgment is “the decision of a court which determines the proceedings (or an identifiable or separate part of them) and which is entered in the records of the court”: at p 636A. Further, an order is “a command by a court that something be done (or not done)”. The term “judgment” in this context is not being used in its broadest colloquial sense to encompass all that might be included in the reasons given by a court for taking a particular course. 
     
      
    28 Such broad statements must be viewed with caution, as the term “interlocutory” envisages a judgment or order which is less than the final determination of the proceedings, disposing of the rights of the parties. In civil jurisdiction, it has been recognised that the test of whether a judgment or order is interlocutory or final may depend either upon the legal effect or the practical effect of the order. Although the former approach is that adopted in construing s 101 of the Supreme Court Act, it does not follow that that approach is necessarily the sole appropriate approach in respect of s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. Both approaches have been treated as relevant in the latter context where, as explained by Gleeson CJ in Bozatsis, it is “the character of the question, and the effect of the decision” that distinguishes a judgment or order from an incidental ruling made in the course of proceedings: 97 A Crim R at 303. Thus, an order staying proceedings may be appellable under s 5F, even though the basis of the order was, in effect, a ruling that evidence was or was not admissible. The reason for the difference in approach flows from the fact that a ruling on evidence, standing alone, lacks finality; it may be varied in the course of the trial. However, once an order staying proceedings is made, the relevant element of finality is established. In the latter circumstance, the order may be challenged and, consequentially, any decision or ruling on which it was based. 
     
      
    29 The unavailability of an appeal under s 5F against rulings on the admissibility of evidence has now been qualified by the inclusion of sub-s (3A), which permits a representative of the State to appeal against any such decision or ruling in the limited circumstances there identified. The inclusion of that additional power also explains the reference in sub-s (5), dealing with the powers of the Court on appeal, not only to the judgment or order, but also to the “decision or ruling”. 
     
      
    30 Although in the present case the judgment given by the trial judge will no doubt have consequences in respect of the admissibility of evidence at a later stage in the trial, assuming it is not varied, it was not in terms a ruling on the admissibility of specific evidence. Rather, it should be characterised as a preliminary determination of certain questions of law which were anticipated as likely to arise in the course of the proceedings. In that respect, this case bears similarities to R v Adamson [2005] NSWCCA 7 and Regina v Piper [2005] NSWCCA 134. 
     
      
    31 In Adamson, the accused had invited the trial judge to decide at an interlocutory stage whether the offences with which he had been charged were offences of specific intent, thus permitting him to rely on evidence that he was intoxicated and did not have the necessary intention, being an application of s 428C of the Crimes Act. The trial judge ruled that the offences in question were not offences of specific intent. The accused then made application to this Court under s 5F to have that determination reviewed. Spigelman CJ (Dunford and Hidden JJ agreeing) held that the trial judge had done “no more than to indicate what he would do, if he were the trial judge, if evidence of intoxication were sought to be adduced over objection, or if such evidence was otherwise before the Court, what direction he would give to the jury on the issue of intention”: at [6]. His Honour concluded that this was not a judgment or order within s 5F because it did “not have the requisite element of finality in terms of resolving an issue in the proceedings in a binding manner”: at [7]. Rather, the indication was closely analogous to a ruling on the admissibility of evidence which, on the authorities was not within the scope of s 5F: at [8].  
     
      
    32 In Piper, the trial judge had made a ruling on admissibility of evidence sought to be tendered in support of a defence of mental illness under s 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (NSW). In a judgment with which Spigelman CJ and Studdert J agreed, Greg James J stated at [11] after referring to Bozatsis: 
     
      
       
        
        “Allowing for a rare case where a ruling on evidence, which might form the basis of a stay of proceedings, or would have the effect of determining the fate of the prosecution case, as being possibly the subject of a s 5F appeal, the court held that a mere ruling lacks the quality of finally determining the rights of the parties such as to partake of being a judgment or order. … That decision and the line of authority that was examined in 
          
        Lethlean 
          
        (supra) to me makes clear that what occurred here, even though the trial judge was examining the ambit of a legal doctrine possibly applicable, was concerned with the rejection or admission of evidence in the defence case, so that his decision did not fall within any such exception to how rulings on evidence are to be regarded so that the right of appeal for which the Crown contends under s 5F(2) exists.” 
        
       
      
    33 In both Adamson and Piper, the appeals were dismissed as incompetent. The question is whether a similar course should be taken in the present case. 
     
      
    34 In determining the scope of s 5F, for present purposes, two matters of practice and procedure, which are distinct and separate in their purposes, need to be considered. The first is that a final judgment or order may be challenged on any basis arising in the course of the proceedings which materially affected the final determination of the proceedings. The wrongful admission of evidence, the failure of the judge to order separate trials and numerous other decisions and rulings which may be made in the course of a trial will all be available, if erroneous, as a basis on which to challenge the final order. So much is recognised by s 5F(6). 
     
      
    35 How, as a matter of practice, this principle should operate in particular circumstances gives rise to a separate question. On the one hand, the availability of a challenge to the final order may be said to militate against the disruption of the orderly running of the criminal process. On the other hand, an error at an early stage of a trial may benefit from immediate correction, so as to avoid the waste of time and resources required by the need to complete the trial, even if it were to result in an acquittal. 
     
      
    36 These conflicting considerations have led to the second matter of practice and procedure. In a number of respects, the legislature has now provided for mechanisms by which legal issues can be determined prior to the commencement of a trial, no doubt primarily to allow for the smooth running of a trial and the minimum disruption of the hearing before a jury. In one sense, the purpose underlying the provision of pre-trial hearings is in step with the principle that a trial should not be disrupted by attempts to run interlocutory appeals. What is less clear is whether the availability of pre-trial mechanisms has had the effect of expanding the scope of s 5F, thus allowing for the final resolution of questions not to be left to a jury, although perhaps at the expense of some delay in resolving such matters prior to the empanelling of the jury. The answer to this question must be resolved by having regard to the mechanisms available for pre-trial determination of issues. 
     
      
    37 The appellant drew attention to three specific mechanisms which, although not expressly invoked in the present proceedings, might be relied upon to justify the course taken and which may give a particular character to the determinations of the trial judge. The first was s 192A of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) which reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        192A Advance rulings and findings 
         
          
          Where a question arises in any proceedings, being a question about:  
           
          (a) the admissibility or use of evidence proposed to be adduced, or 
           
          (b) the operation of a provision of this Act or another law in relation to evidence proposed to be adduced, or 
           
          (c) the giving of leave, permission or direction under section 192, 
           
          the court may, if it considers it to be appropriate to do so, give a ruling or make a finding in relation to the question before the evidence is adduced in the proceedings.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    38 A provision in such terms was introduced to remedy a procedural defect identified in TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124.  
     
      
    39 In its terms, s 192A does not speak of a judgment or order of the Court, but rather a ruling or finding. Furthermore, there is nothing in the section which provides any additional element of finality in respect of such a ruling or finding, beyond that which would attach to a ruling made in the course of the trial absent that provision. Indeed, it is not clear precisely how s 192A was intended to operate. TKWJ concerned the scope of cross-examination of a prosecution witness and the likely consequences with respect to character evidence called for the accused. Use of the phrase “advance ruling” in TKWJ was apparently intended to cover requests for rulings well in advance of any attempt to adduce evidence, and not at the point of presentation of the evidence. In any event, this fresh mechanism for determining such matters gives rise to no new factor, such as might suggest an extended scope for s 5F with respect to evidential rulings.  
     
      
    40 Secondly, counsel for the appellant referred to the District Court Rules 1973 (NSW), Pt 53, rr 10 and 11. Part 53 has application in relation to criminal proceedings. Rule 11 relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Evidence 
        
       
       
        
        11(1) The Court may order that an enquiry by way of a voir dire into the admissibility of any evidence or as to the capacity of a witness to give evidence be had, before the trial Judge, at any stage of any proceedings whether before or after the jury is empanelled.” 
        
       
      
    41 Rule 10, which covers a number of kinds of applications, including applications for an adjournment, separate trials and for an order r 11(1), states: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        10 Pre-trial applications 
         
          
          (1) Any application to the Court in relation to any proceedings which may practicably be made before the day appointed for the hearing of the proceedings shall be made before that day.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    42 This provision more clearly provides the opportunity for “advance rulings” in respect of evidence and other matters. These provisions have been varied since TKWJ, but not in a manner which affects the likely operation of s 5F in respect of orders made pursuant to applications under these rules. The rules were in a largely similar form in 1993 and were considered in Steffan at 638-639. The requirement under r 10 that the court “may make orders with regard to the application” was not treated in Steffan as rendering the outcome of the application in relation to admissibility an interlocutory order for the purposes of s 5F. Nor was it thought that r 12, which required that any “judgment, order, sentence, direction or recommendation given or made by a Judge in any proceedings” be entered, required the entry of an “order” under r 11. The argument that each ruling on evidence made by a trial judge pursuant to such a pre-trial application was an order which should be entered on the indictment or other court record, was expressly rejected. 
     
      
    43 Lethlean (above at [26]) held that a ruling on a point of law raised during the hearing of a criminal trial, that the accused had a case to answer, did not give rise to an interlocutory judgment or order for the purposes of s 5F(3). In his agreement with the judgment of Sheller JA, Hulme J remarked that the case of Rees v Kratzmann [1965] HCA 49; 114 CLR 63 indicated that “whether, in a particular case, there is an order may often be a matter of form”: at 207. The reason for his Honour’s comment was that in Rees, the High Court had granted special leave to appeal in respect of a ruling made by a judge in the course of a liquidator’s examination of a company director that a particular subject matter lay beyond the scope of the inquiry. As explained by Kitto J, 114 CLR at 67: 
     
      
       
        
        “In order to give the liquidators an opportunity to test the ruling, his Honour then made a formal order directing that counsel for the liquidators be not allowed to put the question, and that Kratzmann be not required to answer it, ‘on the ground that such question does not arise from the matters which are set out in the said report’. His Honour gave the liquidators leave to appeal to the Full Court, and an appeal pursuant to that leave was taken.” 
        
       
      
    44 An application was made in Rees to rescind the grant of special leave, as recorded at p 64. Reliance was placed on The Commonwealth v Mullane (see above at [26]). However, the recision application was dismissed without the Court giving reasons: at 65. Whether s 5F would be engaged in circumstances where a trial judge, having ruled on a point of law, adopted the course of making a formal order, need not be determined, as that step was not taken in the present case. 
     
      
    45 Thirdly, and more significantly, the appellant relied on s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), which came into force on 1 December 2005. That provision reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        130A Pre-trial orders bind trial Judge in sexual offence proceedings 
         
          
          (1) A pre-trial order made by a Judge in sexual offence proceedings is binding on the trial Judge in those proceedings unless, in the opinion of the trial Judge, it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding. 
           
          … 
           
          (4) For the purposes of this section:  
           
            
            pre-trial order 
             means any order made after the indictment is first presented but before the empanelment of a jury for a trial. 
             
            sexual offence proceedings 
             means proceedings on indictment in respect of a prescribed sexual offence. 
             
            trial Judge 
             means the Judge before whom the trial proceedings, following empanelment of a jury, are heard.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    46 The phrase “prescribed sexual offence” is defined in s 3(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act so as to include an offence of attempting to commit an offence under s 61I: definition, pars (a) and (d). Accordingly, to the extent that the determinations made by the trial judge constituted “orders” they were pre-trial orders within the meaning of s 130A and were, subject to the qualification expressed in the section, binding on the trial judge, whether or not the person who made the order was the trial judge. (The effect of sub-ss (2) and (3) (not set out above) was to accord a similar status to such orders in any fresh trial proceedings after an appeal or after discontinuance of the original trial proceedings.) Those provisions, the appellant contended, conferred on such pre-trial orders a status and degree of finality sufficient to take them beyond the category of mere “rulings” such as those held in Steffan not to constitute interlocutory judgments or orders. In this respect, the appellant contended, the scope of operation of s 5F had been expanded by the procedural change wrought by s 130A.  
     
      
    47 In terms of procedure, there is no doubt a difference between an interlocutory order (which is any order other than a final order) and a “pre-trial order”, which is an order made after the indictment is presented but before the jury is empanelled. That difference is, however, temporal. Section 130A seeks to carve out, and give binding effect to, orders made in this limited pre-trial stage from orders made during the course of the trial. 
     
      
    48 Although that provision may confer a greater degree of finality on pre-trial orders, it is nevertheless premised upon the existence of an “order” and the question is whether a different approach should be taken to the construction of that term in s 130A, and, as a consequence, in the operation of s 5F. 
     
      
    49 There are now numerous provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act conferring powers on a court to make orders regulating not merely matters traditionally made by order, such as amendment of an indictment, change of venue or separate trials, but also orders (which might equally have been described as directions) with respect to pre-trial disclosure (s 136), orders relating to the disclosure of documents (s 302) and in relation to the giving of evidence by “vulnerable persons” generally (ss 306W, 306Y, 306Z and 306ZM). In other circumstances, the power of the court is described in terms of “directions”, such as powers in relation to the closing of the court (ss 291 and 291A). 
     
      
    50 The characterisation of the action of a court as an “order” in the Criminal Procedure Act is not necessarily definitive of the scope of the term “order” in the Criminal Appeal Act. Nevertheless, in circumstances where the Criminal Procedure Act imposes a degree of finality upon pre-trial orders, which they might not otherwise have had, that is a factor which should be taken into account in determining whether a right of interlocutory appeal arises under s 5F. Thus, when read in context, the scope of the term “order” in s 130A is obscure. It is therefore permissible to take into account the Ministerial statement of the mischief to which s 130A was directed, in accordance with s 34 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW).  
     
      
    51 The second reading speech in relation to the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual Offence Case Management) Bill, which introduced s 130A, reveals two further considerations. The first relates to the purpose of the provision; the second to its scope. 
     
      
    52 In relation to the first, the Minister stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Delay in criminal proceedings, in particular sexual assault trials, is always a concern. Delay can cause secondary traumatisation of the complainants, who prepare themselves to give evidence on each occasion the matter is fixed for trial. The delay may be caused by legal and procedural issues not determined prior to the hearing date. That is particularly traumatic in sexual assault cases, where there may be multiple offenders or multiple victims. The proposed legislation will serve to minimise the stress and trauma of giving evidence for these witnesses, and is part of the on-going process of reform in relation to improving the process surrounding sexual assault prosecutions for complainants.” 
        
       
      
    53 There is some confusion as to how the provision would promote that purpose, but some clarification is obtained by reference to the second question, namely the intended scope of the proceeding. In that regard the Minister stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Rulings on the admissibility of evidence by a judge other than the trial judge are not currently binding and it is not possible to ensure that the same judge will deal with both the pre-trial hearing and trial. … One of the key issues in sexual offence trials is effective case management to ensure that all preliminary matters are resolved in advance of the commencement of the trial and to avoid unnecessary legal argument. Effective case management of sexual assault trials would require the court to resolve issues such as the admissibility of evidence and the use and availability of technology prior to the trials commencing.” 
        
       
      
    54 This statement indicated with some clarity that rulings on evidence and other procedural directions were expected to be made prior to the commencement of the trial and were expected now to be binding on the judge conducting the trial. The Minister gave an example: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where, for example, a ruling was made to admit the police electronic recorded interview with a child as their evidence in chief, this earlier ruling will bind the judge hearing the re-trial, unless the Court of Criminal Appeal ordered that the ruling was in error.” 
        
       
      
    55 It is not entirely clear why rulings made in the course of a trial, but not successfully challenged on appeal, were not also covered by the new provision. However, there was clearly an expectation, although the section did not in terms make such provision, that wherever possible disputes with respect to evidence would be identified and addressed before the jury was empanelled. It may have been assumed that this would follow from the diligent application of Pt 53, r 10(1) of the District Court Rules. By inference from its place in the Criminal Procedure Act, s 130A was no doubt expected to operate with respect to orders made pursuant to s 130, although that provision was directed to the timing of “any orders that may be made by the court for the purposes of the trial in the absence of a jury”: s 130(2). 
     
      
    56 The appellant’s reliance upon the scope of s 130A, ultimately requires consideration by reference to the terms of the “orders” made by the trial judge in the present case. As they did not constitute rulings on evidence, it is not necessary to decide whether such rulings now constitute “orders” for the purposes of s 130A, nor any consequence which may flow from the conclusion that they did, in terms of the operation of s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
     
      
    Jurisdiction: application of principles57 It is unfortunate that, in seeking to ventilate certain issues of law prior to the empanelment of the jury, the prosecutor did not attempt to identify any specific procedure which was being invoked, nor state whether he was seeking any form or order, ruling or determination. It is also unfortunate that, in delivering a “judgment” her Honour did not seek to identify the precise terms of any matter requiring determination, or the procedural mechanism by which the determination was sought. 
     
      
    58 There is no doubt that her Honour reached a view about one or two questions of law, in a manner which could, in a practical sense, have ramifications for other steps taken in the trial. For example, her Honour’s views as to the legal principles discussed in the judgment would no doubt affect the manner in which the prosecutor opened the case before the jury, the evidence called by both the prosecution and the defence and the instructions given to the jury. However, in accordance with the approach adopted by this Court in both Adamson and Piper, these matters cannot be said to constitute “orders”, nor was there any “judgment” in the sense of a formal determination of issues in dispute between the parties. 
     
      
    59 Despite the desirability of obtaining an advance ruling on matters of law, so that the trial may proceed before the jury with a minimum of disruption, the availability of a right of appeal in respect of such rulings is not self-evidently appropriate. The fact that such rulings may affect the outcome does not provide a sufficient basis for permitting an interlocutory appeal. If an appeal were available in such circumstances, many rulings on evidence and disputed directions to the jury would become the potential subject of an interlocutory appeal. That the phrase “interlocutory judgement or order” in s 5F does not extend so far is well-established. Many, but not all of the pre-trial application orders envisaged by Pt 53, r 10 will result in interlocutory orders. Similarly, an order for production of documents by a stranger to proceedings and a non-publication order, may become the subject of an interlocutory appeal under s 5F: see Attorney General (NSW) v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667; Nagi v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (No 2) [2009] NSWCCA 198. However, the expression of an opinion on an issue of law does not fall into that category. 
     
      
    60 It follows that the appeal should be dismissed as incompetent. In the event that the Court was of that view, neither party suggested that the fact of the certificate given by the trial judge required any different outcome: R v Lavender [2002] NSWCCA 511 at [1] (Giles JA, James and Hidden JJ agreeing). 
     
      
    Substantive issues61 Against the possibility that the foregoing analysis may be wrong, it is appropriate to say something about the substantive issues raised on the appeal: cf Kuru v State of New South Wales [2008] HCA 26; 236 CLR 1 at 12. 
     
      
    62 The issues debated before the trial judge concerned the application of s 61HA to an attempt to commit an offence under s 61I and whether the attempt was an offence of specific intent. The second issue had significance in relation to the reliance the appellant might be able to place on his state of self-induced intoxication in relation to his state of mind. However, the second issue was also potentially related to the first. If, to commit the attempt, the appellant needed to intend to commit the offence of having intercourse without consent, knowing the woman was not consenting, then an actual intent to cause that consequence (or even recklessness as to that consequence) would not be satisfied by an absence of a belief based on reasonable grounds that she was consenting. On the other hand, if it were sufficient for the attempt that he had the state of mind sufficient to commit the completed offence a lack of belief as to the consent, based on reasonable grounds, would suffice. 
     
      
    63 It may be accepted that the answer to that question turned on the application of s 61HA to the offence of attempt. On one view, even if s 61HA did not expressly state that it applied to attempts, if, under the general law, the state of mind sufficient for the substantive offence was sufficient for an uncompleted attempt, then any statutory provision defining the elements of the substantive offence would necessarily operate with respect to an attempt. The alternative view is that a statutory provision which modifies the requisite state of mind in relation to the substantive offence need not operate in relation to an attempt; whether or not it does will be a matter of statutory construction. That question will not necessarily be answered by asking whether an attempt is an offence of specific intent, unless the statute identifies that as the criterion conditioning its operation. 
     
      
    64 Although they will not provide the answer with respect to the question of statutory construction, general law principles provide the background against which the statute must be read. It is appropriate to look first at the general law principles. Some of the cases to which this Court was referred turned in part on the operation of statutory provisions in other jurisdictions, none of which was identical with s 61HA. 
     
      
    Attempt as an offence of specific intent65 The issue is whether the element of intention in respect of an attempt to commit an offence such as rape, is satisfied where the offender has a state of mind less than intention, but sufficient to commit the substantive offence. The point may be demonstrated by reference to the offence of murder. While it is sufficient for an accused to intend to cause grievous bodily harm, where death eventuates, it is not sufficient for the offences of attempt to murder, to intend to cause grievous bodily harm where the act does not occur and, as a result, death does not eventuate: see Knight v The Queen [1992] HCA 56; 175 CLR 495. With respect to sexual intercourse where the victim does not consent, the accused knowing that she does not consent, knowledge may be satisfied under the common law by recklessness as to consent, and under s 61HA by a lack of reasonable grounds for believing that the person consented, where she did not in fact consent. 
     
      
    66 In R v Zorad [1979] 2 NSWLR 764 at 773 this Court considered a direction given on a charge of attempted rape as involving an intention on the part of the accused to have intercourse where “either he was aware that the woman was not consenting, or he realised that she might not be consenting and he was determined to have intercourse with her whether she was consenting or not”: at 773B, in the judgment of Street CJ. The Court rejected criticism of that direction on the basis that it was correct to direct the jury that they must be satisfied that the accused “intended to commit those acts which would go to make up the crime of rape, including, of course, such elements of intent as must be associated with the act referable to making up the crime of rape”: 773D (Street CJ, Reynolds JA and O’Brien J agreeing). 
     
      
    67 The matter was also addressed by the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal in Evans (1987) 30 A Crim R 262 at 266-268 (King CJ, Jacobs J agreeing) at 273-275 (Bollen J, Jacobs J agreeing). The Chief Justice, after referring to offences including attempted murder and attempting by wanton driving to cause bodily harm, noting that recklessness was insufficient, continued at 267: 
     
      
       
        
        “Those cases were concerned with unintended consequences of conduct in the sense that the accused person did not intend the consequence which was required by the definition of the complete crime. … 
        
       
       
        
        … The problem in the present case is different. It concerns the accused’s state of mind not as to the consequences of his conduct but as to a state of facts the existence of which renders his action criminal. The state of facts, the existence of which renders the act of sexual penetration criminal, is the non-consent of the person penetrated. The mental state of the accused in relation to that state of facts, required by the definition of the crime in the section, includes reckless indifference to its existence. There cannot be an attempt to commit a crime involving particular consequences where those consequences are not intended, because the notion of unintended consequences is inconsistent with the notion of attempt to bring about those consequences. That reasoning does not apply, however, to an accused’s state of mind as to the existence of circumstances which render an act criminal. There is no reason in principle or logic why steps which are sufficiently proximate to sexual penetration should not constitute an attempt to rape, consent being in fact absent, if the accused has either of the states of mind relative to the consent of the alleged victim which would be sufficient for the complete crime.” 
        
       
      
    68 In R v L the New Zealand Court of Appeal considered a similar issue to that which will arise in the present case, in relation to the offence of attempted sexual violation, which could, pursuant to a statutory provision equivalent to s 61HA(3)(c), be committed where the complainant did not consent and the accused did not have reasonable grounds for believing that she consented: R v L [2006] 3 NZLR 291. The Court of Appeal accepted the approach referred to above, in Zorad and Evans. The Court’s judgment in this respect was approved on appeal to the Supreme Court of New Zealand: R v L [2006] NZSC 18; [2006] 3 NZLR 306 at [8]-[21] (Tipping J). 
     
      
    69 There is also discussion of Pt 11A of the Crimes Act, including the definition in s 428B of “offence of specific intent” and the consequences in relation to evidence of intoxication, in R v Grant [2002] NSWCCA 243; 55 NSWLR 80 by Wood CJ at CL, Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreeing. However, it is the general discussion of intent in relation to an attempt which should inform the construction of s 61HA. 
     
      
    70 In relation to the application of s 61HA, it appears to have been the prosecution case that any evidence that the appellant gave concerning his belief as to the identity of the person with whom he was said to have sought intercourse, was irrelevant. That was because, even if it had been his wife, being unconscious or asleep, she had not had the opportunity to consent to sexual intercourse and therefore did not consent, in accordance with the terms of s 61HA(4).  
     
      
    71 That argument (apparently accepted by her Honour) was not self-evidently correct: in the case of a stable relationship, the circumstances may allow for a factual finding that the partner had had an “opportunity to consent” whether or not she was asleep at the time sexual intercourse was attempted. 
     
      
    72 The question of the knowledge of the appellant arose once it was found that the complainant did not consent, in which case the prosecution could establish that the accused knew that she did not consent if he had “no reasonable grounds for believing” that the other person consented. 
     
      
    73 The operation of s 61HA is expressly dealt within in sub-s (1). Relevantly, it applies “for the purposes of the [offence] under [section] 61I”. However, the appellant was not charged with an offence under s 61I, but with an attempt to commit an offence under that provision, which is an offence under s 61P. Accordingly, the appellant submitted, it had no operation in relation to an attempt. 
     
      
    74 There is some internal textual support for that conclusion. Thus, sub-s (3) operates where a person “has sexual intercourse” with another person: it does not in terms address circumstances where sexual intercourse does not occur. 
     
      
    75 Section 61P states that any person who “attempts to commit an offence under section 61I … is liable to the penalty provided for the commission of the offence”. Before the trial judge, the prosecutor argued that this was not the creation of an offence but merely the statement of the penalty applicable to a common law attempt in respect of specified offences. As a matter of construction, that argument should be rejected. Section 61P is in the common form of provisions in the Crimes Act identifying particular conduct rendering a person liable to a specified penalty. (Section 61I is another provision in the same form.) 
     
      
    76 It was also suggested that there would have been problems for the drafter in incorporating s 61P into s 61HA(1), because s 61P deals with attempts to commit numerous offences, including those under provisions other than the three specified in s 61HA(1). That argument is unpersuasive: it would have been a simple matter to include a reference to s 61P, “to the extent that it applies to the other sections identified in this subsection”. 
     
      
    77 Reference was made in the Director’s submissions to the fact that an attempt to commit an offence is itself an offence at common law and that s 344A of the Crimes Act makes provision effectively in the same terms as s 61P, though with general application. Neither of these factors affects the conclusion that s 61HA(1) in its terms does not apply to attempts to commit offences under the sections which it identifies. 
     
      
    78 More persuasively, the Director contended that s 61HA would operate because, in order to establish the offence of attempting to commit an offence under s 61I, the prosecution would need to make good the elements of an offence under s 61I, including the question of consent and the question of the accused’s knowledge as to consent. In answering those questions, it would be necessary to apply the terms of s 61HA. Such an approach, it was submitted, would be consistent with the general law, discussed above. 
     
      
    79 It may be accepted that this is a possible construction of s 61HA(1), which states that s 61HA applies “for the purposes of” an offence under s 61I, rather than applying ‘to a prosecution for’ an offence under the specified provisions. There is a degree of ambiguity as to the operation of s 61HA.  
     
      
    80 To the extent that s 61HA affects principles applicable under the general law, it does so, relevantly for present purposes, by defining the circumstances in which a complainant “does not consent” and the circumstances in which an accused will be found to “know” that the person does not consent, including the circumstance that he has “no reasonable grounds for believing that the other person consents”. These provisions lower the bar with respect to a successful prosecution for the identified offences. They thereby diminish the rights of an accused under the general law. Such a curtailment of the rights of an accused in a criminal trial call for a clear expression of intention to that effect: see Coco v The Queen [1994] HCA 15; 179 CLR 427 at 437 and other authorities referred to in Harrison v Melhem [2008] NSWCA 67; 72 NSWLR 380 at [2] and [6]-[7] (Spigelman CJ, Beazley JA agreeing) and at [214]-[216]. The contention of the Director in this case is by no means irrational or implausible, but it does not reach the level of clarity required to overcome the express language and textual support for the proposition that s 61HA does not operate with respect to attempts to commit offences identified in sub-s (1). 
     
      
    81 The next question of significance is what her Honour meant by stating that it was appropriate to exclude “the defence” sought to be relied upon. However, there appears to have been a degree of agreement between the parties (as appeared from the submissions before the trial judge and in this Court) that what was in issue was the relevance of the appellant’s state of “self-induced” intoxication. 
     
      
    82 This was undoubtedly a highly fact-specific issue. How it would arise at the trial was not entirely clear, nor fully articulated either in her Honour’s reasons or in the argument before her Honour. For example, under s 61HA(3) (which was presumed to be relevant at this stage of the argument) in considering the state of knowledge of the accused the jury was required to take into account all of the circumstances of the case “not including any self-induced intoxication” of the accused: sub-s (3)(e). One might have thought that it would be the prosecution that would wish to rely upon such a state of intoxication to demonstrate either recklessness as to consent or the absence of any belief as to consent, or even in support of the proposition that the accused took no steps to ascertain whether the person consented. On one reading of s 61HA(3), such an approach would be illegitimate. On the other hand, an accused might seek to rely upon his state of intoxication to establish a reasonable doubt that he had the necessary intention to commit the offence. In that respect, the Court might need to consider whether the offence was one of specific intent, for the purpose of applying either ss 428C or 428D of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    83 Of critical importance in the context of the trial will be the evidence of intoxication and the evidence as to the state of mind of the appellant. On the basis of the authorities governing the trial judge, including Zorad and Evans, it will no doubt be necessary for the jury to be directed as to the intention of the appellant at the time of the offence and as to his state of mind with respect to the consent or otherwise of the complainant. The legal issue of significance in this respect has already been noted, namely the inapplicability of s 61HA for the purposes of an attempt to have sexual intercourse with a person who does not consent, knowing that she does not consent. Beyond that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to go. 
     
      
    Conclusion84 Because the jurisdiction of this Court under s 5F did not arise in the circumstances of the case, the appeal must be dismissed.

   JUDGMENT1. Bilal El Cheikh Bakkour and Nasir Javelosa have both pleaded guilty to a crime called knowingly facilitate organised car rebirthing activity. That is a crime in New South Wales under the Crimes Act 1900 s 154G(1). It carries a maximum of fourteen years imprisonment. Parliament regards the crime as so serious that it has also fixed to that crime a standard non-parole period of four years imprisonment.2. This activity was made into a specific crime in New South Wales as recently as 2006. Before 2006 people who committed the crimes that Mr Bakkour and Mr Javelosa have pleaded guilty to were charged with car stealing or receiving stolen property. At one stage car stealing had a maximum of ten years imprisonment and receiving also had ten years imprisonment. The Parliament increased the penalty for illegally receiving a stolen car to twelve years imprisonment. Now Parliament has described activity known as organised car rebirthing and, as I said at the start, fixed a maximum sentence of fourteen years imprisonment to that crime.3. When the responsible Minister introduced the law into the Legislative Council in New South Wales he described why Parliament was introducing this new law in 2006. He said the following: 
     
      
      “ 
      There are many costs of rebirthing to the community. Firstly, rebirthing means that the stolen vehicle will not be recovered, in contrast to ‘joy riding’-style car theft, where the vehicle is usually recovered. This results in true owners being deprived of their cars permanently, and higher insurance premiums for us all. In addition, if a rebirthed car that has been onsold is subsequently identified, seized and taken back to its true owner, the honest buyer who paid market price for the car may be left with nothing. Secondly, rebirthing is dangerous. It may involve serious physical alterations to the car, such as grafting the front end of one car to the back end of another. This creates a structural flaw in which an accident could mean that the car disintegrates with its innocent new owners inside. Thirdly, because rebirthing is potentially lucrative, it entices young people into becoming involved with organised criminal gangs. It can corrupt legitimate tradespeople who work with vehicles, because rebirthing gangs actively seek to ‘recruit’ professionals working in the industries of motor vehicle repair, wrecking, sale and registration. These people can provide the paperwork to give the rebirthers’ illegal activities the veneer of legitimacy. 
      ” 
       
      
    4. I have quoted from the Minister’s speech because it outlines specifically the reasons why Parliament introduced this law and describes the activity which Parliament was seeking to make illegal and why that activity should be made illegal. I should add immediately that there is no suggestion in this case that there were such serious physical alterations to any of the cars that anybody was put in danger. I referred to the speech, as I said, to point out why Parliament had introduced the law.5. The Court of Criminal Appeal has not yet commented - so far as my or counsel’s researches have revealed - about this new law, but under previous laws when the Court was dealing with car rebirthing activities (as under offences for stealing or car theft) the Court made some remarks in a case called R v Mason [2007] NSWCCA 32. The Chief Judge at Common Law said in a judgment about rebirthing: 
     
      
      “ 
      Regrettably this type of illegal enterprise is not uncommon. It inflicts considerable loss on those members of the community whose vehicles are stolen, as well as inflicting loss on any insurer who may have obligations to provide compensation.” 
       
      
    The other judges in the court agreed with his Honour. 6. It is important in sentencing anyone that the court begins by a description of the serious nature of the offence which it is sentencing the person for. A court must commence its process by assessing how serious an example of the crime it is sentencing the particular offender for. The kind of activity which Mr Bakkour and Mr Javelosa engaged in is conveniently summarised in exhibit A in Mr Bakkour’s case which contained an account of their activity which was prepared by the police and which was agreed to by the offenders.7. The police came to hear about what these men were doing by listening to their mobile telephone calls. I should add here that Mr Bakkour is charged with committing this crime between 1 March 2007 and 19 July 2007 and Mr Javelosa is charged with committing the crime between the same dates. The police say that as a result of their investigations “significant electronic and physical evidence was gathered on these two men’s involvement in the organised and systematic theft of vehicles from the eastern and inner western suburbs of Sydney.”8. Evidence was also gathered in their involvement in the facilitation of organised car rebirthing. The investigations revealed that these men regularly bought damaged cars from auctions throughout Australia and then stole cars of the same make and model to facilitate the rebirth of the damaged car. The repaired cars were then registered and sold.9. In addition, Mr Bakkour and Mr Javelosa were regularly contacted by other persons who placed orders for specific makes and models of cars they wanted stolen in order to rebirth damaged cars those persons were in possession of. Mr Bakkour and Mr Javelosa charged varying fees for stealing the cars depending upon the level of difficulty.10. Mr Bakkour was involved in stealing twenty cars and Mr Javelosa was involved in stealing eighteen cars. The police summary of their activity provides an insight into the predatory behaviour of these two men. On one occasion Mr Bakkour discussed on the phone going out to get a green car for his cousin. He had a description and just went to Rose Bay and stole a green car. The men used expressions such as being “out stealing” when they were driving around or out “dancing”. 11. Sometimes on the phone the men were heard discussing what orders they had for stealing cars that night. Friends and relatives contacted the men and gave them an idea of the sorts of cars which they wanted to be stolen. Mr Bakkour and Mr Javelosa then toured the inner suburbs of Sydney patiently but with perseverance until they found a car which matched the description of the order which they had for that night. Having broken into the car one of them would then drive it back to an accomplice’s place, Mr El-Skaf, where the car would be hidden and later dealt with. I will be sentencing Mr El-Skaf separately for his involvement in this activity.12. Often the cars which had been stolen and taken to Mr El-Skaf’s place were found, as the police described it, clinically stripped of various parts and left in a laneway near Mr El-Skaf’s house. The system was that on their way one of the men would phone through to Mr El-Skaf and let him know that they were on the way so that he could open up his garage facility.13. I need to make an assessment of what the courts call the level of objective seriousness of the crimes which Mr Bakkour and Mr Javelosa committed. That means just how serious an example of this crime is the one which they have committed. 14. As I have said, in Mr Bakkour’s case he was involved in stealing up to twenty cars. Mr Javelosa was involved in stealing eighteen cars. The people who were injured by that sort of behaviour include of course the car owners who lost their car and whatever was contained in it, usually for good because it was destroyed in their activity. Insurers had to pay out. The public indirectly suffer because of activity such as this by the increase in premiums, although that cannot be demonstrated as a particular feature of these cases. And of course by the amateur reassembling of cars there must be an element of risk to the public. I do not take that last factor into account as a specifically aggravating feature, but it is obviously one of the factors about this crime which Parliament had in mind in fixing the maximum sentence.15. Both men participated in this activity with perseverance and regularity over a period of some four months. Mr Bakkour committed the crime because of financial pressure which he was feeling at home. He needed to “survive and provide for his family”. Mr Javelosa was driven into this crime because by the stage that he was committing this crime he had a daily cocaine habit which he needed to support. Both men were paid a certain amount of money for each of the cars which they supplied in the process of the rebirthing activity.16. The behaviour was, as I have already said, in my opinion predatory. These men preyed on innocent members of the community who left their cars at places which they thought were safe only to find them removed the following day and either never found or found completely destroyed. These men undertook this activity as a routine business whereby they generated income for their own personal needs be it either to provide for their family or to provide for their drug habit.17. Mr Vautin, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, argued that both crimes committed by these men were at least within the mid range of objective seriousness if not higher. Both Mr Peluso, who appeared for Mr Bakkour, and Mr Brewer, who appeared for Mr Javelosa, acknowledged that their clients’ behaviour fell within the middle of the range of objective seriousness, but not above that range. 18. In my opinion because of the number of cars involved and because of the persistent, regular criminal activity of these men over such a long period of time both crimes fall above the mid range of objective seriousness. I also take into account the losses occasioned by eighteen to twenty car owners and probably almost as many insurers of those cars.19. Mr Bakkour was arrested on 19 July 2007 and bailed on 11 September 2007, a month and twenty-four days later. He undertook daily reporting and was under a curfew. There was a delay in his matter coming to court because of the need to translate the telephone intercept product from Arabic to English. Mr Bakkour pleaded guilty to this crime on 14 October 2008. Mr Vautin agreed that that was the first available opportunity. 20. Mr Javelosa was arrested on the same day and bailed some time later. In all he spent some two months and twenty-six days in custody. He too pleaded guilty. His plea was entered in the Local Court on 6 November 2008 and Mr Vautin agrees that it was at the first available opportunity.21. It is important that I say something about the personal circumstances of each of these men before I come to assess their sentences. Both Mr Peluso and Mr Brewer called their clients to give evidence. In addition, Mr Peluso called his client’s wife and Mr Brewer called his client’s girlfriend. In each offender’s case there were tendered pre-sentence reports and other material such as psychological reports relevant to the offender and, in Mr Bakkour’s case, the offender’s wife. In addition, there was tendered in Mr Bakkour’s case exhibit E which I will turn to in due course.22. Mr Bakkour migrated from Lebanon in the late 1990’s. He is now twenty-nine. He married in the year 2000 and has a good relationship with his wife. He and his wife have four children all under five years of age. He has his own business as an alarm installer and a person who applies window tinting. In Lebanon he trained as an auto electrician. He was not able to easily obtain employment in Australia and so his wife needed to support him by working in three jobs. He ran up a debt of some $60,000 and he is still in debt to the bank and some individuals.23. These proceedings and his personal circumstances have caused significant stress on his wife who suffers from psychological stress and weight loss. She has been diagnosed as having a major depressive disorder with severe anxiety and stress. 24. Mr Bakkour has three previous convictions committed between 2000 and 2003 for goods in custody and car theft. He expressed remorse in his evidence. That is also demonstrated by his plea of guilty and he apologised in his evidence. There is a psychological report provided by Mr John Taylor who assessed him as having a low to moderate recidivism risk and good prospects of rehabilitation. He is obviously regarded by employers and assessed by Mr Taylor as being a person who works hard. 25. Mr Javelosa, who is aged twenty-eight, was born in Afghanistan. He had to undergo a very significant adjustment in coming to Australia. He had to escape Afghanistan into Pakistan where he spent some years. He struggled when he came to Australia with English when he was going to school. He developed, because of his traumatic background, particularly his experience in war torn Afghanistan, significant personal problems and that led to a gambling problem and a significant drug habit. As I said, he developed a daily cocaine habit.26. Exhibit 10 in Mr Javelosa’s case is a detailed report from a consultant psychologist, Dr John Jacmon. Dr Jacmon described Mr Javelosa as having post traumatic stress disorder as well as depression, anxiety and substance abuse, specifically cocaine. 27. As Mr Brewer pointed out, he suffered extraordinary trauma in early life and it was not surprising that he had the difficulty which he had adjusting in Australia. That would include the mores of the society which he had migrated to. As Mr Brewer said, some people cope with such trauma and others don’t. The drugs which he was taking at the time resulted in what Dr Jacmon described as a highly impaired judgment. He is well regarded and has a good reference from his employer. He now sees a doctor every fortnight and his urinalysis indicates that he is presently drug free. He has a good relationship, although it has been troubled in the past, with Sofia Javelosa, his girlfriend who gave evidence on his behalf.28. He too demonstrated remorse in his evidence. Dr Jacmon thought that his post traumatic stress disorder and depression were likely to worsen, but that he had made an excellent start to a treatment plan which Dr Jacmon prepared. Mr Javelosa too has prior convictions, more than Mr Bakkour. Between 2000 and 2003 he has been convicted of car theft, larceny and goods in custody as well as possessing implements and entering land illegally. In fact, the number of convictions is not significantly greater than Mr Bakkour’s, but there are more convictions.29. In Mr Javelosa’s case he too was regularly reporting whilst he was on bail and was subject to a curfew. The delay in bringing his case to court was brought about by the same need to translate the telephone intercept product from Arabic into English. 30. In Mr Bakkour’s case he has asked me to take into account when I am sentencing him some other offences that he has pleaded guilty to and which have been placed on to a document in accordance with s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 called a Form 1. One of those offences is conspiracy to obtain money by deception and the other is goods in custody. I will take into account, when sentencing him, those offences and will sign the form accordingly.31. In Mr Javelosa’s case he does not ask me to take into account any additional offences under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, but I do note that when he committed the offence he has pleaded guilty to he was at the time at liberty on a Community Service Order which a court had imposed upon him. In other words, the court had released him into the community instead of imposing a more serious penalty on condition that he undertake certain community work and he abused that lenient option which the court offered to him to engage in this very serious crime. Obviously, an important factor to take into account in sentencing for both of these crimes is the deterrence of each of the offender from committing other offences as well as stopping others from committing similar crimes.32. Because of the seriousness of the crime which each has been charged with and the extent to which this is a very significant example of such a serious crime, in my opinion no other sentence than full time custody is appropriate for both of these offenders. 33. In Mr Bakkour’s case given that the finding that his crime was above the mid range of objective seriousness for the reasons that I have given and given that I am taking into account two other crimes on the form, I regard an overall sentence of eight years imprisonment as being an appropriate sentence. However, Mr Bakkour has pleaded guilty and that means that the administration of justice is assisted and made much more expeditious and the courts reward such a plea of guilty by discounting the offence.34. In addition, in Mr Bakkour’s case I have taken into account exhibit E. I place significant weight on the contents of exhibit E and I regard an appropriate combined discount for the plea of guilty and the contents of exhibit E as being just under forty-five per cent. In other words, I am going to discount, that is, reduce the eight years sentence which I would otherwise impose on Mr Bakkour by just under forty-five per cent so that the appropriate sentence for him is reduced to four years and six months.35. The non-parole period for a sentence of four years and six months would normally be about three years and four months. Normally a non-parole period is about seventy-five per cent of the full sentence. Mr Peluso argues that there are special circumstances which warrant me reducing the non-parole period. He says this will be his client’s first time in gaol and there are good prospects of rehabilitation and employment. Those submissions I accept. I propose to fix a non-parole period of two and one half years instead of three years and four months. Shortly I will sentence Mr Bakkour to a total of four and a half years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two and a half years which I will backdate by one month and twenty-four days.36. In Mr Javelosa’s case, taking into account the crime which he has committed which is almost as serious as Mr Bakkour’s, in fact it involves only two fewer cars, and taking into account that he committed that crime whilst he was in the community serving a community service order, but also taking into account his own personal circumstances I regard an overall sentence as seven and one half years as an appropriate overall sentence.37. However, Mr Javelosa also has pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. This makes the administration of justice much more manageable for the authorities. I propose to discount, that is, reduce his sentence by twenty-five per cent because he has pleaded guilty. That reduction would bring the sentence to just over sixty-seven months and I propose to round that down to sixty-six months, that is, five and one half years.38. The normal non-parole period of seventy-five per cent for such a sentence would be four years and one and a half months, but in this case Mr Brewer also argues that there are special circumstances to adjust the non-parole period. His client will need to undergo drug rehabilitation and continue his adjustment to society when he leaves prison. I propose to reduce his non-parole period from four years and one and a half months down to three years so that shortly I will sentence him to imprisonment for five and one half years with a non-parole period of three years which I will backdate by two months and twenty-six days.39. Mr Bakkour, if you would stand up please I am going to sentence you now. Bilal El Cheikh Bakkour, I convict you of the offence of knowingly facilitating organised car rebirthing activities and I set a non-parole period of two and one half years which will commence on 25 September 2009 and expire on 24 March 2012. The balance of the term of the sentence will be two years from 25 March 2012 to 24 March 2014.40. Mr Javelosa, I set a non-parole period for your sentence of three years to commence on 24 August 2009 and to expire on 23 August 2012. The balance of the term will be two and a half years to commence on 24 August 2012 and to expire on 23 February 2015.41. In each case I have regarded it as appropriate to depart from the standard non-parole period of four years because each man pleaded guilty and, in Mr Bakkour’s case, because of s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.Now Ms Duncalf, Mr Peluso, Mr Brewer, any factual errors or mathematical errors or anything that I have omitted or should attend to?DUNCALF: No, your Honour.BREWER: Not on my account, your Honour.PELUSO: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right. Yes?DUNCALF: Your Honour, there is a matter of a confiscation application in each of those cases.HIS HONOUR: All right, I’ll hear you in a moment. I need to explain. 42. Mr Bakkour, your gaol sentence is four and a half years. I have specified that you must serve at least two and a half years in gaol. Your non-parole period is two and a half years. I have backdated it by one month and twenty-four days because of the time that you spent in custody. So I backdated it to commence on 25 September this year. Your non-parole period will expire on 24 March 2012. That is the first date, 24 March 2012, on which it appears you will be eligible to be released on parole back into the community. Whether or not you are released on parole depends upon the Parole Authority, not upon me. The balance of the term of two years will be on parole, provided you are released at the end of your non-parole period.43. Mr Javelosa, your overall sentence is five and a half years. Your non-parole period is three years. I too have backdated that by two months and twenty-six days. So your sentence started on 24 August 2009 because of the time you spent in custody. Your non-parole period expires on 23 August 2012. 23 August 2012 is the first date upon which it appears that you will be eligible for parole. Whether or not you get parole, as I said to Mr Bakkour, will depend upon the Parole Authority and once you are released you will be on parole. If you are released on that day then you will be on parole for two and a half years.Ms Duncalf?DUNCALF: The Crown is just seeking to stand the confiscation application over in both of those cases.HIS HONOUR: All right. I don’t think there is any process filed, is there?DUNCALF: No, not yet, your Honour. I don’t know whether the matter needs to stay before your Honour or whether the matter can go back to the Sydney District Court.HIS HONOUR: I don’t know the answer to that either, why don’t you make some enquiries. I imagine somebody will be here next Tuesday for when I’m sentencing Mr Hello and Mr El-Skaf. Perhaps you can find out in the meantime. I don’t mind either way. I’m here next week and then I’m in Broken Hill for three weeks and then I’m not back in crime till March, back out here. So you make some enquiries and perhaps if you or Mr Vautin could let me know on Tuesday morning?DUNCALF: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Okay. Now Mr Jankowski and Mr Velcic, do you have an application?JANKOWSKI: Yes, I do your Honour. I’d ask your Honour to continue bail till next Tuesday.HIS HONOUR: Yes, I’m afraid I’m not going to. 44. I have determined that a full time custodial sentence is appropriate and the risk of flight is obviously very significant at this stage. So your client is refused bail. Do you have an application, Mr Velcic?VELCIC: Does that also apply to my client, your Honour?HIS HONOUR: Do you apply for bail?VELCIC: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right. 45. For the same reasons I refuse bail. 46. Mr Hello and Mr El-Skaf, both of your lawyers have applied for bail, but I have refused bail. That means that you are going into custody now because I have determined I can tell you that I will be sentencing you to full time custody and it is not appropriate to release you in my opinion because of the increased risk of flight. You are both bail refused. 47. Both Mr El-Skaf and Mr Hello are remanded in custody until Tuesday 24 November 2009 before me here at Parramatta at 10 o’clock. Again I will direct that an Arabic interpreter be available on that day and my associate will make sure that it happens so far as it is within her power.JANKOWSKI: Your Honour, I’m wondering whether it’s appropriate to have two of them, only that your Honour is not sentencing as it were them separately, but referring to both in the one set of remarks?HIS HONOUR: Yes, I see your point, we’ll order two, yes, two Arabic interpreters. Anything else?JANKOWSKI: No, your Honour.VELCIC: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right, I will now adjourn.ADJOURNED PART HEARD TO TUESDAY 24 NOVEMBER 2009

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 14 September 2009 Craig William Benbow was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty to the offence of murder but guilty to the offence of manslaughter. The Crown accepted that plea of guilty in full satisfaction of the indictment. I note that the maximum penalty for the offence of manslaughter is imprisonment for twenty-five years. 2 The facts in respect of the matter are set out in a document which is exhibit A before me and they are not in dispute. I will quote from the document in part. During the evening of 28 October 2007 Travis Jennings was drinking with Craig Benbow and Lucas Collis at the rear of the unit occupied by Mr Collis at 4/655 Dight Street Albury. They were all drinking heavily. Around 9.30pm they were inside the unit when the offender fell asleep on Mr Collis’ bed. Mr Collis asked Mr Jennings to rouse the offender. Mr Jennings grabbed a cricket bat and prodded the offender’s arm two or three times. The offender woke up and pulled the bat away from Mr Jennings. The offender then got up from the bed and swung the bat at Mr Jennings, striking him on the left side of the head causing him to fall to the floor. The offender continued to hit Mr Jennings to the head and torso with the cricket bat. 3 Mr Jennings crawled out of the lounge/bedroom of the unit and down several steps outside the unit. The offender followed Mr Jennings and continued to strike him on the head with the cricket bat. Mr Jennings crawled to the bottom of the steps and was lying on the footpath whilst the offender continued to strike him to the head with the cricket bat. Mr Collis said to the offender, “What the fuck are you doing?” The offender turned around and struck Mr Collis on the left forearm with the cricket bat.  
     
      
    4 Mr Collis went inside the unit and obtained a wooden stick. He went back outside and attempted to strike the offender with the stick. The offender turned around and used the bat to hit the stick out of Mr Collis’ hands. He then struck Mr Collis to the head and ribs with the cricket bat. Mr Collis ran back into the unit and locked the door. From inside the unit he saw the offender continue to strike Mr Jennings to the head with either the bat or the stick. 5 A resident of the units, Mr Damien Bennett, was asked for assistance by Mr Collis. Mr Collis and Mr Bennett called triple-O and ambulance and police personnel subsequently attended the unit. The ambulance personnel found that Mr Jennings was unresponsive to treatment and attempts at resuscitation were made. He was subsequently conveyed to Albury Base Hospital before being transferred to Royal Melbourne Hospital. He did not regain consciousness and was pronounced dead on 2 November 2007. An autopsy was conducted at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine the following day. Dr Stephen Cordiner noted head injuries as the cause of death and he concluded that these injuries were suggestive of the “broader application of blunt force”. 6 Forensic testing was conducted on a number of items recovered from the crime scene. Mr Jennings’ DNA in the form of blood stains was recovered from the tee-shirt worn by the offender, the Adidas runners that he wore and also on the shorts that he was wearing.  
     
      
    7 The offender participated in a police interview subsequent to his arrest on 28 October 2007 in which he said he remembered nothing as a result of an alcohol induced “blackout”. He confirmed that he had been drinking with Mr Collis and Mr Jennings prior to the incident.  
     
      
    8 Mr Jennings’ DNA was also recovered from the tip of the piece of wood that Mr Collis said he had attempted to use to stop the offender from striking Mr Jennings. The cricket bat was found inside Mr Collis’ unit. There was no blood staining visible upon it.9 Police found amongst the offender’s property some receipts which indicated that he had purchased a two litre flagon of sherry at noon on the day of the incident and then a further 750 millilitre bottle of the same at 5pm. He told the police that he had had four Serapax tablets of 30 milligrams each, although the person who apparently supplied those tablets to him believed that it was only two. In addition to the Serapax and the sherry it is apparent that the offender had also consumed some wine. 10 The facts go on to indicate it is likely that the offender consumed somewhere between one and a half to one and three-quarters of a litre of sherry plus the wine supplied by Mr Collis in addition to the Serapax that he had consumed. It was the opinion of a forensic scientist that the offender would have had a blood alcohol content somewhere between 0.245 and 0.311 with the effects of the alcohol exacerbated by the Serapax. The Crown appears to accept that the level of intoxication substantially impaired the offender’s ability to reason and it was upon that basis that the plea of guilty to manslaughter was accepted.11 In addition to the offence of manslaughter to which the offender has pleaded guilty he has also today pleaded guilty to an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in respect of Mr Collis and I am called upon to sentence him in respect of that offence as well. 12 The offender was born on 11 February 1978 and so he was aged twenty nine at the time of the offence and he is thirty-one now.  
     
      
    13 He has a criminal history that commenced when he was aged seventeen. He has a number of offences on his record which were committed in Victoria between 1995 and, it would appear, the year 2000. They comprise offences of property damage, behaving in an offensive manner in public, being drunk in a public place, possession of a weapon, possession of a drug and a number of matters of burglary, theft, receiving and obtaining property by deception. He was imprisoned for the first time in 1997 at the age of nineteen. There was an offence of intentionally causing injury for which he was sentenced to imprisonment in 1998. 14 In New South Wales he has a number of convictions. They include further dishonesty offences. Of particular note, in 2004 he was sentenced to nine months imprisonment for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, assault, and entering a building with intent. A three month non-parole period was set and it was a condition of his parole that he accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and attend and complete such counselling programs and courses as recommended. 15 He was sentenced to imprisonment again on 22 November 2005 for a term of seven months although execution of that sentence was suspended upon him entering into a bond pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and that was for offences of common assault. There were similar conditions of the bond in relation to accepting supervision and attending and completing counselling and courses. On 29 October 2007, the day following his arrest for the matters for which he is to be sentenced today, he was sentenced to three months imprisonment for an offence of damaging property and an offence of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order.16 I have heard submissions this morning in relation to how I should access the offender’s record of previous convictions. Certainly it is the case that I am not to impose any additional punishment upon him for those past offences. The sentence I impose must retain an appropriate relativity with the objective seriousness of the offence. The submission was made on the offender’s behalf, and I accept, that it is not established that the offender has a history of becoming intoxicated and then committing crimes of violence. Nevertheless, given the number of offences on the offender’s record and the relatively lengthy period over which he has offended I am of the view that his record indicates a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law such that considerations of retribution and personal deterrence must receive greater emphasis when he is sentenced for the present matter.17 The background of the offender is well set out in a report of Dr Suzette Sowden, a clinical psychologist. I will not refer to every aspect of the report, although I have taken it all into account, but it includes the following. The offender was the eldest of three children. His mother left his father when he was two or three years old in order to escape the impact of his father’s reported alcoholism. The offender struggled with his schooling and he left school halfway through year 10. He has a drug and alcohol abuse history which commenced when he was fourteen years of age when he commenced smoking marijuana. At age twenty-one he commenced taking morphine, amphetamines and benzodiazepines. He has had what I accept is a relatively good history of employment despite his drug and alcohol addictions. It is indicated by Ms Sowden that his criminal history appears to relate to his drug and alcohol abuse and also to difficulties that he experienced within the relationship with his wife who I accept suffered from a mental illness. 18 Ms Sowden reports that the offender has only just recently identified the need to address his longstanding substance abuse disorders. She reports that he appeared to her at least to be between the “pre contemplative to preparation stage of addressing his drug and alcohol abuse”. She also reports that he had an adolescent history of some behavioural difficulties and developed a mild antisocial personality tendency in his adult years. Ms Sowden endeavoured to make a diagnosis by reference to DSMIV and in the course of that she expressed the conclusion that the offender appeared to suffer from some symptoms of anxiety and depression and had a long history of substance use disorder, and there was also, as I have mentioned, the appearance of mild antisocial personality tendencies. Ms Sowden indicates that the offender is not mentally ill although he does have a history of anxiety in the form of panic attacks and paranoid thoughts. The other material tendered before me this morning supports the proposition that the offender does have a history of anxiety, depression and, on occasions, panic attacks.19 On the topic of rehabilitation Ms Sowden expressed the opinion that without significant support the offender’s rehabilitation may result in relapse in relation to this drug and alcohol use with him continuing to mix with people with pro criminal and pro drug and alcohol attitudes. She reported that the offender himself expressed concern about the success of his rehabilitation without the receipt of significant support. However, later in her report she indicated that the offender appeared ambivalent about being rehabilitated with him indicating a degree of anxiety about returning to society. She recommended that the offender have an extended parole period. She recommended that he be required to undergo psychological counselling, that he undergo drug and alcohol counselling, that he be encouraged to engage in a training program to facilitate his capacity to re enter the workforce, that he has regular drug and alcohol screening, and that he have frequent meetings with his parole officer. She also indicated that it is important that he is encouraged to mix with people who have anti criminal attitudes and she recommends that he be required to undergo a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. I include all of those aspects of her recommendation in my sentencing remarks so that they are available for consideration by the Parole Authority in due course.20 The starting point for considering the imposition of sentence for an offence of manslaughter is that the offence involves the felonious taking of the life of a human being. I have before me two victim impact statements, one by each of the deceased’s parents. I have read and re read those statements and I am thankful for Mrs Jennings having read her statement out to the court earlier this morning. Whilst the law provides that it is impermissible for me to take into account the effect that the offence has had upon the family and friends of the deceased I do acknowledge the grief and the loss that they have suffered and I extend to them my condolences.21 In assessing the objective seriousness of the offence I take into account all of the circumstances as disclosed in the statement of facts. To be noted in particular are a number of matters. First, that the offence was not planned. It was spontaneous and irrational and unreasonable in reaction to being prodded by Mr Jennings in his attempt to arose the offender from his drunken stupor. I accept that the offender was significantly intoxicated as the Crown indicates its acceptance in the statement of facts. Another matter is that there was a weapon used, that is the cricket bat, and it was used obviously with lethal effect. The use of a weapon, I must hasten to add, in the commission of crimes of murder and manslaughter is not an unusual feature and so in terms of it being regarded as an aggravating feature it has little bearing on the matter. This is not a case, it must be observed, where the offender was carrying the weapon or went to obtain it, as can be seen in a number of other cases of manslaughter by the use of a weapon. Rather, in this case, it was a case of the offender simply seizing upon the instrument that Mr Jennings had used to prod him to try and waken him.22 It was submitted that I could conclude that the offender was experiencing a panic attack. I have earlier indicated my acceptance that he has a history of experiencing such attacks. There is, however, no evidence from which I could conclude that that was indeed operative at the time of the offence. It would be rather speculative for me to take that into account in my assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence and I do not do so. 
     
      
    23 It was submitted that another matter I could take into account was that there was an element of provocation, although Mr Scragg, who appeared on behalf of the offender, did not seek to make a great deal of that issue. I do not accept in any event that the offender was provoked. It was he who initiated the violence. What Mr Jennings did could not be regarded as an act of violence or provocation by any means.  
     
      
    24 I take into account also that it was a sustained attack as the Crown has submitted. It commenced in the bedroom of the premises and proceeded to the area outside the premises. Mr Jennings was literally bludgeoned to death with this cricket bat. Unlike some other forms of manslaughter I accept in this case that there was no specific intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon Mr Jennings but it must be noted that the absence of a factor that would make the offence more serious does not operate to reduce the seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    25 Mr Scragg submitted in terms of the objective seriousness of the offence overall that it should be assessed as falling at the lower end of the range. I do not accept that submission. This is, in my consideration, a serious form of manslaughter by the commission of an unlawful and dangerous act.  
     
      
    26 Another matter that I must take into account in the assessment of sentence, although it’s not relevant to the assessment of objective seriousness, is that the offence was committed whilst the offender was on bail for other criminal offences and that is well recognised under the law as a serious aggravating feature.27 The offender’s plea of guilty was entered on the day of the second listing for trial of this matter. There was some contention between the parties as to the degree to which I should discount the sentence to reflect the utilitarian value of the offender’s plea. I accept that the offender has no recollection of the events. It would seem that the plea came after the Crown disclosed to the offender’s representatives some further evidence by way of DNA that, as it appears from what the Crown Prosecutor told me this morning, substantially strengthened the Crown case that would have been presented at trial. On the one hand Mr Scragg submitted that the discount should be towards but not at, he conceded, the top of the range indicated in the guideline judgment of R v Thomson v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, whereas the Crown submitted that it should fall around the middle of that range. I accept that the plea indicates that the accused has accepted responsibility for his actions but in assessing the utilitarian benefit of the plea I am proposing to proceed as the Crown has conceded. Ordinarily when a plea of guilty is entered on the day of trial there should be an expectation of a discount of no more than 10 per cent but, as I said, I will accept and proceed upon the concession made by the Crown Prosecutor.28 A submission was made that I should find that the offender is remorseful for his offending conduct. The only material from which such a conclusion could be drawn is the offender’s plea of guilty. There is nothing in the report of Dr Sowden as to anything the offender said to her that would support such a finding. I have not heard any evidence from the offender himself in these sentence proceedings. In my view the plea of guilty itself is an insufficient basis to support a conclusion of remorse and absent any evidence from the offender himself I am not prepared to make a finding in his favour in respect of that topic.29 It was submitted that the offender was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions because of a disability. I accept that the offender had a history, as I have indicated, of experiencing anxiety and depression and panic attacks but I am not persuaded that they were operative and had any bearing upon the commission of the offence and so I do not accept that submission.  
     
      
    30 I do accept on the other hand that it appeared to Dr Sowden that the offender was below average in his intelligence, although it must be noted that this was not to a degree that affected his level of functioning within the community in any significant degree. I accept that he had an upbringing that had a number of unsatisfactory features. I reiterate that I accept that he has a reasonable history of employment. I accept also that he had successfully rehabilitated himself in the past from an opiate addiction and that he has expressed a desire to engage in processes that would promote his rehabilitation in the future.31 Mr Scragg provided me with a schedule of cases involving sentencing for manslaughter. I do not propose to refer to any individual case. What emerges from those cases in the schedule provided, and from my understanding of sentencing generally for this offence, is that there is no identifiable range to which I can have recourse in assessing the appropriate sentence in this case. The maximum penalty indicates the degree of seriousness with which Parliament regards the offence of manslaughter generally. The circumstances in which the crime of manslaughter can be committed are extremely wide but the maximum penalty is one thing to bear in mind. The assessment of the sentence in this case apart from that must be determined by an assessment of the objective circumstances of the offence itself and those features which I have referred to which are personal to the offender.32 The offender was arrested on 28 October 2007 and has been in custody since that date. He was sentenced on 29 October 2007 to concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for three months for the offences for which he was on bail at the time of the commission of the offences with which I am concerned. I have given consideration to the submissions that have been made as to whether I should order the sentence I impose to be concurrent or partially accumulative or completely accumulative upon those sentences. In my final view I have determined that it would be appropriate to accumulate the sentence completely, having regard to the fact that they were completely unrelated offences to the ones for which the offender is presently before the court.  
     
      
    33 The offender is to be sentenced for the assault upon Mr Collis as well but having regard to the principle of totality it would be appropriate to order that the sentence for that offence be concurrent and therefore subsumed within the sentence I impose for the offence of manslaughter.34 I accept the submission by Mr Scragg that there are special circumstances for reducing the proportion of the sentence to be represented by the non parole period. Those special circumstances are the need for the offender to engage in rehabilitation and there is a need for him to be closely supervised over an extended period of time by the officers of the Probation and Parole Service in order to facilitate and increase the prospect of such rehabilitation being successful. Such parole supervision, I would expect, would place emphasis upon the need for drug and alcohol rehabilitation as well as anger management and the psychological factors referred to in the report of Dr Sowden.35 Mr Benbow would you please stand up. For the two offences to which you have pleaded guilty you are convicted. For the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm you are sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of three months. That sentence is to date from 28 January 2008 and expire on 27 April 2008.36 For the offence of manslaughter you are sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years and six months and a balance of the term of the sentence of three years. That sentence will take effect from 28 January 2008 and you will be eligible for release on parole on the expiration of the non parole period on 27 July 2012. That is a total sentence of seven years and six months. Without your plea of guilty it would have been a sentence of nine years.37 I dismiss the backup charge under s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On Monday 9 November 2009, the Court made orders extending time in which to file an application for leave to appeal to 12 October 2009 and refusing the application for leave to appeal. These are the reasons for that refusal. 
     
      
    2 The application was under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5F(3) in respect of the dismissal of a notice of motion by a judge of the District Court (Tupman DCJ). 
     
      
    3 On 10 August 2009, the applicant came for trial before Tupman DCJ in the District Court at Sydney. The applicant had been committed for trial over three years before on 13 April 2006. The indictment that was presented contained two charges under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (the “DMT Act”), s 25: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Count 1: 
         That between 5 February 2005 and 9 February 2005 at Five Dock in the State of New South Wales he supplied a prohibited drug, namely cocaine, in an amount not being less than the large commercial quantity of that drug. (That charge related to 2 kg of cocaine.) 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: 
         That between 15 March 2005 and 18 March 2005 at Five Dock in the State of New South Wales he supplied a prohibited drug, namely cocaine, in the amount not less than the commercial quantity for that drug. (That charge related to 750g of cocaine.)” 
        
       
      
    4 The applicant pleaded not guilty to both charges. Prior to the empanelling of the jury, the applicant sought to have the whole of the evidence in the Crown case excluded on the basis that it was illegally obtained and prima facie inadmissible by reason of Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 138. The Crown opposed the application asking the judge to admit the evidence in the exercise of her discretion under that section. 
     
      
    5 The background which led the Crown to accept the necessity for an exercise of discretion under s 138 can be briefly stated as follows. From late 2004, after information from an informant (“Tom”), the Australian Federal Police (“AFP”), the New South Wales Crime Commission (“NSWCC”) and the New South Wales Police (“NSWP”) established a joint task force to investigate the activities of what they believed to be, on the information of Tom, a major drug importation syndicate. 
     
      
    6 As part of the investigation, members of the taskforce applied for, and were granted, several authorities pursuant to the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997 (NSW) (the “LECO Act”). The LECO Act made acts or omissions which would otherwise have been unlawful, not unlawful if carried out under an authority in connection with obtaining evidence of criminal activity or corrupt conduct or arresting someone involved in such activity or conduct or in frustrating such activity or conduct. 
     
      
    7 Relevantly, two controlled operation authorities were obtained by Mr Mark Standen, then Assistant Director of Investigations of the NSWCC. The first authority concerned the activity that led to the applicant’s first charge. Tom was supplied with 2 kg of cocaine to be supplied to the applicant, and Tom was to receive $340,000 from him in exchange. The relevant circumstances in the Crown case for this first charge were that Tom, at the direction of one Hatfield (said to be a member of the criminal syndicate), attended a meeting on 6 February 2005 at Rushcutters Bay. The applicant was present. Hatfield told Tom to sell the remainder of 7 kg of cocaine buried at a location in Sydney. Tom was wearing a listening device. The Crown case was that the applicant arranged for Tom to supply him with 2 kg of cocaine 2 days later for $340,000, $300,000 in cash and $40,000 on credit. The agreement was to meet at a Five Dock gym and swap bags. The next day, Tom took task force members to a park in Wahroonga and the cocaine was dug up and taken into the possession of the NSWCC. The next day, 2 kg of cocaine was given to Tom who then met the applicant as arranged. Tom was again wearing a listening device. The exchange of bags containing drugs and money took place. 
     
      
    8 The second authority concerned the possession and supply of 750g of cocaine for Tom to supply to the applicant and to receive $120,000 in payment. Between 22 February and 17 March 2005, the remaining 5 kgs of cocaine were supplied by Standen and other officers to Tom to supply others at Hatfield’s request. There were several controlled operation authorities obtained for these supplies. The authority relevant to the second charge was for a supply on 17 March 2005 to the applicant. The Crown case was that on 16 March 2005 Tom met the applicant and Hatfield at Rushcutters Bay. Tom was again wearing a listening device. It is alleged that the applicant agreed to buy 750g of cocaine from Hatfield for $120,000. Tom and the applicant made arrangements for supply the next day at Five Dock. The next day Tom and the applicant met. The cocaine was handed to the applicant. Arrangements were made for later payment. Later, on 6 April 2005, Tom met the applicant at Rushcutters Bay and was paid. 
     
      
    9 After the applicant’s committal, he and Mr Dowe, a fellow accused, took proceedings in the Supreme Court attacking the lawfulness of the controlled operation authorities concerning charges brought against them. On 6 March 2007, Hall J rejected their claims that the authorities were unlawfully granted: Dowe and Gedeon v Commissioner of NSW Crime Commission [2007] NSWSC 166; 169 A Crim R 43. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed: [2007] NSWCA 296; 177 A Crim R 44. An appeal to the High Court was, however, successful: [2008] HCA 43; 236 CLR 120. The relevant controlled operation authorities were held to be invalid, thereby removing the statutory protection of the LECO Act from various unlawful acts committed by Tom, Standen and others in the investigation. It was therefore necessary for the Crown to rely upon the Evidence Act, s 138 if the evidence of the events recounted above was to be admitted. 
     
      
    10 On 10 August 2009, the applicant filed in Court a motion seeking “orders” as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. That all the evidence sought to be relied on by the Crown to prove the charges in the attached Indictment against the Defendant be excluded pursuant to section 138 of the Evidence Act (NSW) 1995. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Any such other order the court deems appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    11 On 27 August 2009, when the matter was before Tupman DCJ for argument, an amended notice of motion was filed in Court seeking “orders” as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. That all the evidence sought to be relied on by the Crown to prove the charges in the filed indictment against the Defendant be excluded pursuant to section 138 of the Evidence Act (NSW) 1995. 
        
       
       
        
        2. That the prosecution case is doomed to fail as a consequence of order 1 and  
        that a permanent stay be granted. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Any such order that the court deems necessary.” 
        
       
       
        
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    12 On 14 September 2009, Tupman DCJ delivered a 59 page judgment dealing with the Crown’s application and the applicant’s amended motion. Her Honour concluded that she should exercise her discretion under the Evidence Act, s 138 to admit the impugned evidence. For present purposes, it is unnecessary to describe her Honour’s reasoning or to be precise about the evidence in question. In the final paragraph of her reasons, her Honour said at [72]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Taking into account all of the matters which I am required under Section 138(3) and those other matters to which I have referred, on balance I accept that the desirability of admitting the evidence, despite its being in contravention of Australian law, is outweighed by the undesirability of doing so and it will be admitted in the exercise of my discretion under Section 138(1) of the  
        Evidence Act 
        . The notice of motion is thus dismissed.” 
        
       
       
      It should be noted that her Honour obviously made a slip in that passage and she intended that her finding should be understood as if the words “is outweighed by the undesirability of doing so” were read as “outweighs the undesirability of not doing so”. 
       
      
    13 Given what was before the Court, the judge can be seen in [72] to have undertaken two judicial acts: 
     
      
       
      (a) to rule on the admissibility of evidence; and 
       
       
      (b) to dismiss a motion, being the amended notice of motion filed on behalf of the applicant. 
       
      
    14 Subsections 5F(1), (2), (3) and (3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act are, relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “5F  
        Appeal against interlocutory judgment or order 
         
         
        (1) This section applies to:  
         
         
          
          (a) proceedings (including committal proceedings) for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court or in the District Court, and 
          
         
         … 
        
       
       
        
         
        (2) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings to which this section applies. 
         
         
        (3) Any other party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings:  
         
         
          
          (a) if the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) if the judge or magistrate of the court of trial certifies that the judgment or order is a proper one for determination on appeal. 
          
         
         
        (3A) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case.” 
         
         
        
       
      
    15 It is established that under s 5F a decision on a ruling on the admissibility of evidence is not an interlocutory judgment or order. Thus, no appeal lies under s 5F from a ruling on evidence: Steffan (1990) 30 NSWLR 633 at 639-642; Glossop [2001] NSWCCA 165 at [15]-[19]; Lavender [2002] NSWCCA 511; 37 MVR 491 at [8] 492; Kocer [2006] NSWCCA 328 at [1], [10], [15] and [18]; and EK [2009] NSWCCA 4 at [11]-[12] and [19]. 
     
      
    16 If the applicant’s motion had been dealt with in its unamended form there could be no doubt that the substance of the order dismissing the motion was a ruling on evidence. The addition of the prayer for a stay is said to change the position. 
     
      
    17 The application for the stay was wholly conditional (in form and in substance) on the exclusion of the evidence (being the form of order 1 (“be excluded”). No argument for a stay, beyond a lack of admissible evidence, was put forward. 
     
      
    18 In Bozatsis and Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296 a permanent stay was granted upon the rejection of certain evidence. The appeal from the stay order was held to be competent. Notwithstanding that a ruling on evidence lay at the foundation of the stay order, in substance the appeal was from the stay order. If no appeal could be brought no mechanism existed for testing the correctness of the rulings and the permanent stay thereafter governed the accused’s position. Section 5F(3A) now deals with Crown appeals in relation to rulings on evidence.19 In Marchione [2002] NSWCCA 131; 128 A Crim R 574 a stay was sought from the trial judge on the ground that the “evidence available to the Crown was not capable of establishing the appellant’s guilt”: at 575 [8]. It was not a case dealing with the rejection or admission of evidence. The certificate under s 5F(3)(b) issued by the judge in that case reflected the legal issues concerned which did not encompass the admissibility of evidence: see 575 [10]. At 577 [15]-[17] Bell J (with whom Heydon JA and Dowd J agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[15] In the present case although it would seem that there was some lack of formality in the way the appellant’s application was framed, it was an application that the proceedings charged in count 1 of the indictment be permanently stayed. An order permanently staying an indictment or, conversely, declining so to do is one which falls within the terms of s 5F:  
        Edelsten 
         (1989) 18 NSWLR 213; 45 A Crim R 289;  
        Bozatsis 
         (1997) 97 A Crim R 296. There is undoubted jurisdiction to stay proceedings on indictment upon the ground that their continuance would amount to an abuse of the process of the Court:  
        Jago v District Court (NSW)  
        (1989) 168 CLR 23; 41 A Crim R 307;  
        Ridgeway 
         (1995) 184 CLR 19; 78 A Crim R 307. 
        
       
       
        
        [16] The application was advanced upon the basis that the abuse was of the character described by Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ in  
        Walton v Gardiner  
        (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay its proceedings on grounds of abuse of process extends to all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the Court, which exist to administer justice with fairness and the impartiality, may be converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness. Thus, it has long been established that, regardless of the propriety of the purpose of the person responsible for their institution and maintenance, proceedings will constitute an abuse if they can be clearly seen to be foredoomed to fail.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [17] The success of the appellant’s application depended upon persuading the primary judge that the evidence upon which the Crown proposed to rely upon at trial was not capable of supporting the charge which it brought. It is true that such a contention if advanced, and rejected, at the close of the Crown case would not have afforded the appellant a basis for seeking leave to appeal under s 5F(3)(a). However, the order appealed against is that of a refusal of a stay and not a ruling made during the trial such as that in  
        Lethlean 
         [(1995) 83 A Crim R 197]

    20 Nevertheless, at 577 [18], Bell J quoted the Court in Steffan at 640-641 where the relationship between ruling on evidence and stay applications was discussed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was submitted by the Crown that, in order to prevent the circumvention of the restricted terms of s 5F, this Court should always refuse leave to appeal from a refusal of a stay where that decision is based upon a ruling as to the admissibility of evidence. We are not prepared to accept that submission in the absolute terms in which it was expressed. Although it is not easy to formulate an example, there may well be the rare case where a ruling upon the admissibility of evidence in favour of the accused would demonstrate a proper basis for a stay of proceedings, so that it would be appropriate to grant leave to appeal from a refusal of a stay in such a case notwithstanding that the principal legal issue which would be determined in the appeal was the admissibility of evidence. This Court’s decision in  
        Groves 
         did not go so far as this submission by the Crown goes.” 
        
       
      
    21 At 577-578 [19], Bell J then stated that it was appropriate to bear in mind the observations in Groves (2 April 1990 NSWCCA unrep No 60407 of 1989) concerning the limits of a s 5F appeal. Relevantly the Court in Groves said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In this way it was argued the applicant ‘could not lawfully be convicted’ on the evidence proposed to be adduced by the Crown, so that the further prosecution of him would amount to an abuse of process. 
        
       
       
        
        The applicant faces a difficulty in seeking to raise either proposition in this case by way of an application for leave to appeal under s 5F. First, the trial judge was not invited to rule on the admissibility of the evidence or to exercise the discretion in question, nor was he asked to rule that there would be insufficient evidence to go to the jury. Had he made any such ruling at the commencement of or during the trial, it would not have been amenable to an appeal under s 5F:  
        Edelsten 
         and  
        Powch 
        . It is difficult to see why the applicant should be permitted to have an appellate Court review a decision refusing to stay the further prosecution of the proceedings on these grounds, when they were not taken before the trial judge, and when the relevant rulings during the trial could not have been reviewed save by appeal after conviction pursuant to s 5 of the Act [ 
        Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
         (NSW)]. 
        
       
       
        
        As the decisions in  
        Edelsten 
         and  
        Powch 
         show appeals under s 5F are to be kept within strict confines. This Court should be slow to permit those decisions to be watered down by allowing parties to pursue, as grounds for stay applications, matters which are more properly the subject of rulings or decisions in the trial and are amenable to appeal under s 5. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Although we do not wish to foreclose entirely the possibility that considerations relative to the ability of the Crown to call a case sufficient to go to the jury, or relative to the integrity of a verdict, cannot be taken into account on a stay application brought prior to trial, we cannot as presently advised envisage circumstances in which that might be appropriate.” 
         
        
       
       (emphasis added) 
       
        
       
      
    22 It can be readily accepted that, in practical effect, this is an application to appeal against a ruling on evidence. The Crown submitted that this fact should found the conclusion that the Court had no statutory authority to hear the application. This was reinforced, it was submitted, when regard was had to the conditional nature of paragraph 2 of the amended motion. It was submitted that substance should be preferred over form. 
     
      
    23 The difficulty with this argument is that s 5F is directed to questions of legal form: the existence of an “interlocutory judgment or order”. Here, the judge dismissed a motion which contained a prayer for a stay, albeit conditionally phrased. On this view there was, albeit “in form”, an interlocutory order and the Court has statutory authority to entertain an application under s5F. 
     
      
    24 Nevertheless, in our view, the application should be refused. Even assuming that the form of the amended notice of motion gave this Court jurisdiction, any discretion should be exercised in conformity with the fact that the entire substance of the application concerns the ruling on the admissibility of evidence. In accordance with Steffan, it should not be stated categorically that the Court should always refuse leave to appeal from a refusal of a stay where that decision is based on a ruling as to admissibility of evidence. However, no factor, in our view, here takes the matter out of what would ordinarily be the fate of such an application. It is true that the rejection of all the evidence would in all likelihood lead to a stay being granted. That, however, is insufficient here to make this the truly exceptional case. To grant leave and hear the appeal would almost certainly delay the applicant’s trial once again. Over three years have passed since he was committed and over five years from the events said to found the charges. The clear desirability of finalising the proceedings against the applicant is a powerful consideration. 
     
      
    25 The judge dealt with the evidence and arguments with apparent care. That is not to say that there may not have been error committed. None, however, has been demonstrated in the arguments put to this Court. The applicant, first argued that the judge erred in concluding that the members of the taskforce had a reasonable excuse for possessing the drugs. We see no apparent error of principle in how her Honour dealt with this issue. Secondly, it was submitted that the judge improperly took into account the gravity of the charges against the applicant in assessing the gravity of the impropriety in the contravention by the authorities. We do not read her Honour’s reasons as having truly done so. Thirdly, it was submitted that the judge erred in stating that the risk of harm to third parties was not high. This expression of the judge must be read in context; nevertheless the way her Honour put it is open to debate. That said, we do not see it as likely to vitiate, on its own, her Honour’s conclusion. These matters are insufficient to persuade us of the existence of arguments of sufficient strength to warrant the further delay to the commencement of the trial. 
     
      
    26 Further, if it be the case that the applicant were to be convicted of the charges, or either of them, his appeal rights in relation to the evidence will be unaffected. 
     
      
    27 In our view, no reason of any persuasiveness was put forward to grant leave.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Mr Lacey just stand up for a moment. My practice is to tell people in advance what sentence they are to receive then I am going to give my reasons. The total sentence I propose to impose on your matter is a sentence of seven years and eleven months with a non-parole period of five years. The way I have calculated that sentence is as follows. You can sit down now thank you.2 The starting point of the sentence for the offence committed of acting with intent to prevent lawful apprehension is nine years, the maximum penalty is twelve years. I have given you a discount as I am required to do by the decision of Thomson v Houlton of twenty per cent, for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty.3 In relation to the first resist arrest matter, the statutory maximum there is five years, I think you said Mr Crown is that correct?4 CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour.5 HIS HONOUR: I propose to sentence you to two years six months imprisonment. For the second resist arrest I propose to sentence you to nine months imprisonment. Those sentences themselves will be concurrent with one another, but the sentence for the act with intent to prevent lawful apprehension will be accumulative to the extent of nine months upon the sentence for one of the resist arrest matters. So there is a partial accumulation of nine months. I have made a finding of special circumstances; I propose to date the sentence from 28 July. I know you have been sentenced to a term of one month imprisonment on appeal, but I do not see any point in partially accumulating the sentences I impose. So the earliest date you will be eligible for release to parole will be 27 July 2013. Do you understand that?6 OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.7 HIS HONOUR: I will give my reasons now. 8 Garry Robert Lacey appears today for sentence in relation to three offences, having been arraigned in this Court in respect of five offences, two of which he pleaded not guilty to. He was acquitted of the charges to which he pleaded not guilty.9 The charges for which he was found not guilty were firstly, count 1A, which alleged that he, on 28 July 2008 at Coffs Harbour in the State of New South Wales did drive at Adam Williams, with intent to murder Adam Williams. The other charge for which he was found guilty was an allegation that he, on the same date at the same place, did assault Ann Cook, a senior constable of police whilst in the execution of her duty.10 On arraignment, the prisoner pleaded guilty to count 1B alleging that he on 28 July 2008 at Coffs Harbour in the State of New South Wales used an offensive instrument, namely a motor vehicle, registration number AA89KH with intent to prevent the lawful apprehension of himself. The facts of that matter were encompassed within the Crown’s allegation in relation to Count 1A. That charge was left in the charge of the jury and in light of his plea of guilty and in light of the evidence of course, the jury returned a verdict of guilty in relation to that charge. The maximum penalty for that offence is twelve years imprisonment.11 He also pleaded guilty to two charges of resisting Adam Williams, a senior constable of police whilst in the execution of his duty, these were counts 2 and 3. The jury were not required to consider those charges. The Crown did not accept the plea of guilty in relation to count 1B in discharge of the indictment, but there was no issue that counts 2 and 3 need be left with the jury. He pleaded ‘not guilty’ to count 4, an allegation of assaulting Senior Constable Cook in the execution of her duty, of which he was acquitted by the jury. 12 Having been found guilty by the jury in relation to count 1B and also being required to be sentenced in relation to counts 2 and 3, the prisoner has asked me to take into account a number of offences on a Form 1. These offences are offences that were committed either before or during or after the events giving rise particularly to count 1B.13 On the Form 1 there were a number of offences including an offence of common assault committed upon Bruce Williams. Also there was an offence of larceny of fuel, valued at $32.65 from a service station in Coffs Harbour called the Bailey Centre, an offence of the use of an unregistered and uninsured motor vehicle at the time of the commission of the offence identified in 1B and beforehand, an offence of malicious damage to a motor vehicle, the property of Peter Hutchison, committed before the offence of using an offensive instrument with intent to prevent lawful apprehension and an offence of malicious damage to another vehicle, the property of the North Coast Area Health Service. Subsequent to his arrest, there are two offences committed of intimidating police officers in the execution of their duty, respectively Senior Constable Gregory Neville and Detective Senior Sergeant Peter O’Reilly, who was the investigating officer in respect of the matters on indictment.14 The facts as I find them are from the facts presented in relation to the matters on the Form 1 and the evidence in the trial are as follows: the offender was a disqualified driver. On the morning of 28 July 2008 he drove his motor vehicle, a green coloured Ford station wagon, the subject of evidence in the trial, in the vicinity of Prince James Avenue Coffs Harbour. 15 Mr Williams drove past the accused in his vehicle and Mr Williams stopped his vehicle, at the intersection of Marshall Street and the Pacific Highway Coffs Harbour, at a red light. He noticed the prisoner’s vehicle very close to the back of his car, then accelerate quickly past him on his left hand side as he was turning in the Pacific Highway. 16 The prisoner then veered his motor vehicle into the lane Mr Williams was travelling in and cut him off. Mr Williams had to brake hard to avoid colliding with the prisoner’s vehicle. The prisoner’s vehicle went sideways, smoke came from the tyres and the tyres screeched. The prisoner’s vehicle slid on an angle and stopped approximately ten metres in front of Mr Williams’ car. Mr Williams’ drove past the prisoner’s car but stopped further down the road, in order to write down the prisoner’s registration number. 17 The prisoner drove his motor vehicle into the Caltex service station nearby and commenced putting petrol in his car. Mr Williams came over to him and took a photograph of him. Williams said, “What’s your problem mate? You’ll have to wait for the traffic in front of you because I can't go anywhere until they move.” The prisoner yelled, “Fuck off, I’ll bash your fucking head in.” 18 The prisoner was still holding the fuel filler in his right hand. He reached towards Mr Williams with his left hand, grabbed him around the throat, squeezed and applied pressure. Mr Williams attempted to take photographs of the prisoner with his camera. The prisoner faced Mr Williams and returned the fuel filler back to the bowser. The prisoner lost his grip, Mr Williams grabbed the front of the prisoner’s shirt to stop himself from falling over. Mr Williams was still being held by the shirt and also being held by the throat. Mr Williams began to walk backwards and the prisoner punched at his head a number of times, a number of these punches connected. Williams dropped his head and the prisoner grabbed him in a headlock and lifted him at the same time. 19 Mr Williams attempted to pull the prisoner towards the centre of the service station area, an attendant came out and attempted to break up the fight. The prisoner let go of Mr Williams and yelled at him, “I will get you, I won’t forget you”, amongst other things. The prisoner got back in his motor vehicle and drove off, not paying for the petrol that he used. Hence the charge of larceny of the petrol as set out on the Form 1.20 He then drove at speed and collided with the back of a parked stationary vehicle which was a brown coloured Daihatsu and the front passenger side of a vehicle entering the service station, before he drove north again on Grafton Street. In other words, he collided with a white Toyota Corolla. Both vehicles contained passengers and were stationary at the time of impact. The prisoner’s vehicle exited the car park onto the Pacific Highway from the northern exit, travelling at speed. He did not stop to see if anyone was injured. Obviously he was only concerned for his own circumstances.21 The prisoner was observed by Senior Constable Williams performing Highway Patrol duty with other police officers on the Pacific Highway on what I understood to be the eastern side of the highway, with Constable Williams’ car facing a southerly direction. The prisoner drove by, driving from the scene of the offences to which I have just referred in a northerly direction. He drove onto the median strip with hazard lights flashing and yelled some comments at the police. He was observed by Senior Constable Williams and Senior Constable Cook to drive through a set of red lights, causing vehicles entering that intersection to take evasive action. 22 As it transpired, he drove down Park Beach Road and eventually drove into Vincent Street, where he had formerly lived. His manner of driving along the Pacific Highway as observed by Senior Constable Williams was erratic. 23 In any event it is suggested that the prisoner was driving in a manner dangerous. I do not have to resolve that issue and I do not have to sentence the offender for that matter. The facts are, however, it is quite clear on the evidence of Senior Constable Williams, Senior Constable Cook, which I accept, and particularly that of Mr Williams, that the offender was driving in erratic manner. The driving of the motor vehicle occurred at a time when the vehicle itself was uninsured and unregistered. Those latter matters, as I have earlier pointed out are on the Form 1.24 To return to the matters that are the subject of the charges on the indictment, Mr Williams gave chase and the court had an in-car video of his pursuit of the offender’s vehicle. The in-car video evidence shows that he obviously lost sight of the offender. The offender had ultimately made his way to Vincent Street at Park Beach about two to three kilometres from where he was first seen by Senior Constable Williams. Senior Constable Williams found his way to Vincent Street where he saw the offender’s vehicle.25 The prisoner’s erratic driving continued into Vincent Street. This was a dead end street approximately one hundred and fifty to two hundred metres in length. It ran east-west from Ocean Parade which runs parallel with Park Beach to the east up to the dead end. The prisoner drove to the dead end, or western end of the street, did a U-turn and on the photographic evidence available, appears to have knocked over some plastic wheelie bins or garbage bins before parking his vehicle outside a friend’s place, with the car facing in an easterly direction. He left his motor vehicle and apparently went into one of the premises, either 22 or 20 Vincent Street. Shortly afterward Senior Constable Williams pulled up in front of the offender’s car. The evidence establishes quite clearly the prisoner’s car and the car of the police officer facing one another were something in the order of two to three metres apart.26 Exhibit D, the in-car video shows in chilling detail what then happened. As the police officer got out of his car, the offender returned to his car. He can be seen clearly to stand at the doorway of his car for a short period of time - a matter of seconds - looking towards the Senior Constable, knowing full well that the Senior Constable was there to arrest him. In his mind, in relation to the events at the Bailey Centre, although the Senior Constable was not aware of those events. He was there to arrest him in relation to his erratic driving.27 The prisoner got in the car. The car was stationary for some seconds. The prisoner himself gave evidence at the time he believed the officer was there in relation to the Bailey Centre incident.28 The prisoner had completely failed to comply with the demands of the police officer, all reasonable in themselves, to stop and get out of the car. The offender, by whatever words the police officer used, knew that he was under arrest. He could see that the police officer had produced his firearm. The police car was partially blocking his exit from Vincent Street and of course he was aware of his own misbehaviour, including, I would imagine, his driving.29 The prisoner hesitated for a period of time as he sat in the driver’s seat, revving his engine. He would appear from the video evidence and the other evidence, to drive off, initially turning slightly to the left and then deliberately steering the car towards the police car and the Senior Constable.30 The evidence establishes that the Senior Constable had turned at this point and was trying to seek refuge at the rear of his vehicle. He was struck from behind in the buttocks or around the rear belt line and at that time he had his back turned to the car.31 The prisoner knew at that time the Senior Constable was defenceless and I am satisfied that he intended to strike him with the motor vehicle to cause him some bodily harm. The prisoner drove on, knowing that he had struck the police officer. In fact on his own version, he saw the police officer hit the road after being struck. He saw his vehicle strike the police officer.32 The prisoner drove approximately fifty metres up the road and then turned, either in a sharp U-turn or in a three point turn. The manner of his turning does not matter very much. There was some conflict in the evidence on this aspect. Whichever way he turned, at that point he had determined to return to where he had struck the police officer or nearby. On turning, he then drove directly at the police officer, observing the police officer to hobble quickly in a northerly direction away from the rear of the police car to supposed safety wherever he could find it.33 The prisoner gave evidence at the trial that the policeman shot his service revolver at him as he drove in an easterly direction. This claim had no support from any evidence, either physical or eye witness.34 The evidence establishes that the prisoner tracked the police officer’s movements and drove in an endeavour to strike him with the motor vehicle. I reject the account given by the prisoner that he intended only to scare the police officer and that he was deliberately avoiding attempting to hit him with the car. The facts are that he drove up onto the footpath and continued in a straight line, narrowly missing a colorbond fence and the tyre marks show him running directly into a brick wall.35 The prisoner in my view was endeavouring to strike the police officer but to avoid any harm to himself. His claim in his evidence that if he wanted to hit the police officer he would have taken out the fence and the tree, to which the police officer was heading, I reject.36 As it transpired, he missed the police officer by as little as a metre and perhaps as much as a few metres. He was so intent in his attention upon the police officer he did not realise that he was to drive unto a brick wall at 20 Vincent Road, approximately ten to fifteen metres beyond the position where he passed the officer.37 Although his car was disabled, the prisoner was not finished with the police officer. As the prisoner sat behind the wheel the police officer not able to see his hands, told the prisoner to get out of the car and show his hands or vice versa. The prisoner either ignored, or did not hear, the warnings from the police officer. Then the police officer discharged his firearm twice. Two cartridges were found in the grass area, near the driveway to 20 Vincent Street and were in my view, in conjunction with other evidence, conclusive pieces of physical evidence to establish that the police officer’s account of the circumstances of the discharge of his firearm were truthful.38 The prisoner got out of the motor vehicle, but rather than dissuaded by the use of the firearm, the officer’s demands, the collision and his success in striking the police officer, he engaged the police officer in a violent struggle leaving the police officer having to use his capsicum spray on him. This struggle was the basis of count 2 in the indictment.39 I bear in mind at this point the police officer was weakened from the injuries he suffered and his exertions in trying to avoid being run over. Mr Lacey well knew the police officer was injured - to what extent of course he could not know.40 The struggle with Mr Lacey further weakened the police officer as one would expect. But when sprayed with OC spray, Mr Lacey, who had deliberately engaged the police officer in the struggle, then disengaged himself and fled, eventually to 14 Vincent Street seeking water to spray on his face. Whilst washing his face at the rear of the premises in a laundry Senior Constable Williams, found him this time, with the assistance of Senior Constable Cook. The offender still resisted arrest by refusing to allow himself to be restrained or handcuffed although the extent of resistance at this point was much less than previous. This was the basis of count 3. He was eventually dragged and pulled to the front of the premises where he was made secure. Other police arrived and the secured the scene.41 Senior Constable Williams is to be commended for his courage in continuing to engage and ultimately arrest the prisoner notwithstanding his injuries and the threat to his safety by the prisoner’s conduct. Similarly his colleague Senior Constable Cook is to be commended for her selfless willingness to assist her colleague. The offender’s hostility towards Senior Constable Williams and other police is exhibited in the facts of the events giving rise to the subjects of intimidation in the Form 1.42 Notwithstanding all that I have outlined, the fact that he was adversely affected by OC spray, he was under arrest and he knew well that he was in a very precarious position in a forensic sense, when transported to Coffs Harbour Police Station his aggressive behaviour continued. Such was his behaviour that a support person was asked to attend and that person remained with the prisoner.43 He was breath tested and underwent various forensic procedures. Apparently he did not have any alcohol in his blood stream, nor any drugs. So there is nothing in the nature of anything that he ingested to explain his behaviour.44 He was a disqualified driver until February 2021. 45 At approximately 11.40am, this is almost two hours after the events relevant to count 1B, Detective Senior Sergeant Peter O’Reilly who was at that stage performing the role of Custody Manager, approached the dock to speak with the prisoner who appeared agitated and aggressive. After a heated discussion the prisoner said to Senior Sergeant O’Reilly, “I know your wives, I know your children, you’re fucked, you’re all fucked”. 47 Detective Sergeant O’Reilly said “Gary is that a threat”? The prisoner said “you’re fucked”. At approximately 11.50am the prisoner stood up pointed at Senior Constable Neville and said “I’m gonna fuckin cut your head off and shit down your throat”. The prisoner also said “I’m gonna burn your house down and kill your family”. Neville said to the prisoner “did you just threaten me”? The prisoner said, “No threat it’s a promise”.48 I have the prisoner’s criminal history as part of the material that has been presented by the Crown. The prisoner was born, according to the criminal history, on 5 May 1964. He started offending in the late 70s when, on my calculation, he would have been in his mid teens, charged in the Children’s Court with a PCA offence for which he was disqualified for three years. In 1979 he was convicted of driving in a manner dangerous as a child or found guilty I should say of driving in a manner dangerous as a child and driving whilst disqualified and was committed to an institution. A break enter and stealing matter followed in the Children’s Court. As a child he appeared in the Tweed Heads Petty Sessions, was convicted of high range PCA, disqualified driver and again committed to an institution until he was eighteen years. There was an appeal against the severity of that penalty and a fine was imposed in relation to at least one of those matters. He was convicted as an adult at the Murwillumbah Petty Sessions for PCA, a reading of .175 grams of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, and sentenced to a period of a hundred hours community service. At the same time he was convicted of being a disqualified driver giving a false name and a fraudulent use of a license. Therein follows a number of minor matters relating to the use of drugs of no great moment.49 There was then, so far as his criminal history is concerned, a significant break between 1985 and 1999. In 1999 however he was convicted of driving a vehicle in a menacing manner. He was fined modestly and disqualified again for twelve months. He was also convicted of contravening an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order. In May 1999 he was convicted of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty and resisting or hindering police in respect of two counts in the execution of their duty and was placed on a reconnaissance and fined. Again in 1999 three months later he was convicted, as I would understand, in his absence of driving whilst disqualified having committed that offence in June 1999 within three weeks of being granted a reconnaissance for the assault police matter. He was dealt with on the disqualified driver matter it in September 1999. In fact at that time he was dealt with for three separate drive whilst disqualified matters and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment and charged with other offences. He appealed against what appears to be the severity of the penalty and the learned judge reduced the term of imprisonment. 50 He was convicted of shoplifting in 2001 and possessing a prohibited drug and convicted of stealing from a shop again in 2003.51 In August 2004 he was convicted of resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty and fined and he was convicted of resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty in 2008 for an offence for which he was charged in January 2008. On 22 August 2008 he was convicted of resisting officer in execution of his duty, resisting or hindering an officer in the execution of his duty which offences were charged in January 2008. For the resist officer in the execution of his duty offence he was sentenced to two months imprisonment. He appealed against the severity of that penalty and the sentence of imprisonment was reduced to one month to commence on 22 August 2008 expiring on 21 September 2008. He was convicted for having goods in his custody, being reasonably suspected of being stolen or unlawfully obtained, on 12 June 2009. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for that offence to start from 9 January 2009. He was apparently charged in relation to that offence, according to the criminal history, on 9 July 2008.52 He was also convicted on 7 July 2008 for an offence committed on 13 June 2008 of intimidating an officer in the execution of his duty for which he was fined $500. These latter details of his criminal history reveal that the offender was on bail in relation to two separate groups of offences, one a goods in custody and two offences relating to resisting or hindering police, at the time of the commission of the offences with which I am concerned.53 I note those terms of imprisonment imposed both by the Local Court and on appeal to the District Court, but as I have indicated to the offender I propose to date the sentence I impose from the date he came into custody without making the sentences I impose partially accumulative or wholly accumulative on the other. I think the short length of those sentences makes such an accumulation academic. However, I have been provided with the facts in relation to the intimidate police matter which the offender was sentenced shortly before the events of 28 July. Those facts are quite revealing in the context of the events with which I am concerned.54 Police attended upon the premises the offender was then living at on 13 June 2008 to execute a warrant. The offender was not present at his premises. But as the police were leaving the prisoner returned. He became agitated and aggressive towards the police. He declined to provide any information which of course is not something against him. But after a short period of time he approached the detective sergeant who was present and said “I’ll find you, I’m gonna come and kill you, you cunt, don’t go near my kid”. The police officer not unreasonably felt intimidated. Police took hold of the prisoner and informed him he was under arrest for intimidation of a police officer. Whilst attempting to handcuff him he remained highly agitated and made several attempts to remove his hands from the rear to his front. The prisoner was forced against the wall where he could be more effectively managed and eventually he was subdued but he continued to be aggressive and abuse police during the incident. He was taken to the police station, provided his rights under the LEPRA and when interviewed the prisoner said in passing when told he would be interviewed in relation to how he came to be arrested he said, “for telling the Sarge I’d kill him if he touches my boy”, confirming the allegation against him.55 One of the matters that arose in the course of submissions was the fact that the offence in count 1B of the indictment is the most serious offence with which the prisoner has been charged to date.56 His previous criminal convictions, serious in themselves, have all been dealt with in the Local Court or the Children’s Court. This led to a submission that I might regard the offence in count 1B as “uncharacteristic”. It is correct that the prisoner has not committed an offence of this seriousness or this type before. However from the facts of the circumstances of the commission of the offence with which I will call the principal offence, because it requires the taking into account of Form 1 matters; the underlying attitude and conduct demonstrated by the prisoner, which caused this offence to occur, cannot be seen as “uncharacteristic”. 57 This is so for two very important reasons. It is quite clear both from his criminal history, and the facts in relation to the earlier intimidation matter a month before, and the prisoner’s evidence in the trial, that the prisoner has hostility and anger towards police. Of course I do not have the facts of all the matters where the prisoner has been convicted of resisting or hindering police. In fact the only facts of matters other than the matters with which I am concerned are the facts to which I have referred in relation to the intimidation matter, for which he was convicted in early July 2008. The time is fast coming when sentencing judges should be provided as a matter of course, with the facts of any offence, dealt with summarily or on indictment that may be relevant to an understanding of the matter or matters for which the prisoner is to be sentenced in this Court. 58 But his criminal history and the facts of this matter, and the related intimidation matters on the Form 1, clearly show an attitude of anger and hostility on the part of the prisoner towards police. The prisoner sought to suggest in his evidence before the jury, in passing, that he had been subject to some injustice on the part of the police force, but not the police officers involved in this matter. That provided him with no excuse whatsoever to conduct himself in the way he did, towards Senior Constable Williams and Senior Constable Cook. 59 But even if there was some feeling of injustice in the back of the prisoner’s mind at the time, it is to be borne in mind the aggressive and violent way on which the prisoner had behaved himself, within the half hour before, towards people who were not police, Mr Williams and the owners of the cars into which the prisoner drove to make his escape from the Bailey Centre.60 The other matters to take into account were not only that the prisoner disqualified until 2021, but he had a long history of offences for the misuse of motor vehicle. He was misusing his motor vehicle on this day when Senior Constable Williams saw him. He had no right to be driving a car. He has had findings of guilt as a juvenile for driving in a manner dangerous, driving in a menacing fashion, PCA matters and many convictions for driving whilst disqualified. And at the heart of the offence set out in count 1B is the prisoner’s misuse of a motor vehicle in that instance, exercising disregard for Senior Constable Williams’ welfare in his intent to prevent lawful apprehension.61 There was reference in the evidence of the Pastor, to whom I will refer later in relation to some subjective matters, that the prisoner had been subject to some stresses in the time leading up to the commission of the offences with which I am now concerned. There had been some concern on the part of the prisoner, because one of his children had travelled to Melbourne to visit the child’s mother and had not returned, the prisoner having had the care of his children for some period, at least before the commission of these offences. I have no direct evidence from the prisoner in relation to the reason for his behaviour on this day and it may be that he was under some stress because of personal problems. But understanding that, does not provide any explanation for the conduct of the prisoner towards Senior Constable Williams, set out in the matters in the indictment, other than the fact that the prisoner acted in an angry and hostile fashion with no justification whatsoever. The facts of the matter are that the prisoner throughout this day, was only concerned with his own selfish interests, whatever they were, and they remain essentially unexplained.62 When one analyses his criminal history in respect of count 1B, I have concluded that his criminal history and his driving history as it is relevant to the conduct in that count relating to the motor vehicle does not entitle him to any leniency. I have given close consideration to whether the evidence establishes an aggravating factor, under s 21A(2)(d), as a relevant aggravating factor for the purposes of that section. The fact that the offender has a record of previous convictions as a legislative aggravating factor is a matter of some subtlety and I need not digress to analyse the judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to this matter. 63 I believe in the circumstances that, without the facts in relation to all of his previous offences committed against police I could not, for the purposes of sentencing him in relation count 1B, determine that sub para (d) is made out beyond reasonable doubt. I believe I should limit the relevance of is criminal history to that count to what I have outlined. I do however feel that the previous conduct of the offender towards police established by other convictions, is an aggravating factor in relation to counts 2 and 3, albeit that those other matters were dealt with in the Local Court and may be matters of less seriousness than the matter with which I am currently concerned in count 1B.64 With regard to the prisoner’s subjective circumstances, I have some evidence but not a great deal of evidence. Certainly no direct evidence from the prisoner, other than what came from him in the trial, primarily addressing the events of 28 July. I had helpful evidence from Pastor Jones, who is the Pastor of the Abundant Life Ministry. As I said earlier in passing to Mr Smith and the Crown, he gave impressive evidence. 65 As I pointed out in the course of submissions, it struck me that the person that Mr Jones has dealt with is a different person than the person demonstrated in the facts of this matter and by the prisoner’s criminal history. There may be two Mr Laceys. But the facts of the matter are that the person that Pastor Jones has dealt with, certainly did not demonstrate himself in any way, shape or form, on 28 July in his dealings with his various victims, to whom I have referred. I have taken Pastor Jones’ evidence into account and I have given it weight, both as I am required to do in assessing mitigating matters in the general common law sense, in assessing the appropriate sentence and also in determining the issue of whether there are special circumstances, for the fixing of a non-parole period. 66 To summarise what Pastor Jones said in his evidence: he runs a Ministry that provides a great deal of help to underprivileged people in Coffs Harbour, providing a type of soup kitchen and a discount supermarket.67 He first met the prisoner in July 2007, he knew that the prisoner had had a background of drug usage, had been depressed about his personal circumstances and came to the Ministry looking for changes in his life, and I accept that the prisoner demonstrated to Pastor Jones, his capacity to make changes in his life. In fact over a period of time, up until approximately some weeks at least before the offences with which I am concerned, the prisoner seemed to embarked upon a different path. 68 It should be noted when one considers the detail of Pastor Jones’ evidence, that whilst the prisoner did seek to pursue a different path in a range of ways, this did not stop him committing offences. As I have pointed out, he was charged with offences on 12 January 2008, in the middle of the period of which Pastor Jones speaks, of resisting arrest and resisting or hindering police. He was further charged on 13 June 2008 with intimidating a police officer when the police came to his home, as I earlier outlined. 69 The Pastor gave evidence that under his direction the prisoner’s personality appeared to change and the Pastor became something of a father figure. He provided counselling and the prisoner reciprocated this counselling by making a constructive contribution to the religious community, assisting with work around the site of the premises where the Ministry conducts its work. 70 It is from Pastor Jones that I had evidence that the prisoner has two brothers, one is a man of substance with a business in Coffs Harbour, the other has had trouble with the law, as it is euphemistically expressed, and is currently in prison.71 Mr Jones has met the prisoner’s mother in Murwillumbah and also met the two children of the prisoner from a prior relationship. My understanding is that the children are aged seventeen and eleven and the boy had travelled to Melbourne as I said earlier, before these offences and now both children are with their mother. I do not have a complete picture of their circumstances, nor is it argued that their circumstances present exceptional circumstances - that is, presents circumstances concerning third parties that might exceptionally impact upon the sentencing proceedings. 72 I accept Pastor Jones’ evidence that the prisoner has a deep affection for his children, that he was a caring father for them for a period of time, that he is saddened by the fact that they are now separated from him which is inevitable, that he is concerned about their welfare. But other than that, the evidence is very sparse, and there are no other conclusions I can reasonably reach.73 As I have said earlier, there is a suggestion from Pastor Jones that the prisoner was stressed and agitated by the circumstances of his son returning to Melbourne and then not coming back to Coffs Harbour, and this showed in the prisoner behaving in a somewhat unusual way, so far as Pastor Jones was concerned, in the weeks leading up to this offence.74 It seems as though the prisoner had changed in his attitudes and behaviour in the weeks leading up to this offence. But whether this was simply a return to his normal ways, or an aberration in the context of the Ministry provided to him by Reverend Jones, I am unable to say.75 Pastor Jones acted as his support person on the day of his arrest for these matters. He noted the prisoner was very upset and very angry and that is self-evident from the facts and the prisoner had no right whatsoever to be angry towards Senior Constable Williams, for simply trying to arrest him and creating the situation that he has now created for himself and the stress and fear that he created for Senior Constable Williams.76 I accept that Pastor Jones will support the prisoner on his release and that the community offers him support and there is corroboration or support for Pastor Jones in the references that were tendered. There were three references, all from persons associated with the Abundant Life Church, and they saw a side of the prisoner that is not self-evident from his conduct on as far as his criminal history. They refer to him as honest and reliable, generous in his contribution to the community, which Pastor Jones was concerned. They never saw him act violently or in a hostile fashion. One referee refers to him erring on the side of easy-going. None of these people felt threatened by him in their dealings with him. 77 In this community’s context it is clear the prisoner showed a capacity to be well behaved, respectful, industrious and for taking positive steps to change his life, notwithstanding its slings and arrows in the past. Unfortunately, however, the lessons he may have learnt from this community, were not operating upon him on 28 July.78 This evidence from this community largely through Pastor Jones particularly has weight, in my view, in the consideration of the appropriate non-parole period.79 With regard to some of the more technical aspects of this sentencing exercise firstly the prisoner has been in custody since 28 July 2008 as one would expect and for the reasons I have outlined I propose to date the sentence I impose from 28 July 2008. 80 I have had regard to Callaghan’s case ([2006] NSWCCA 58) which deals primarily with the issue of fixing sentences where there has been a revocation of parole or an existing gaol sentence. I have given consideration to whether I should have made the sentence I imposed, in an artificial way, partially accumulative or accumulative upon the sentences imposed in the District and Local Court. As I have pointed out I see that exercise as academic. If the sentences imposed by other courts had been longer there would have been some utility in some partial accumulation. However, as now constructed there is no utility, in the context of this sentencing exercise, in my view.81 I am required to sentence the offender in accordance with the principles of Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. That means I am required to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and also required to give close regard to the totality of the criminality and to determine thus the issues of concurrency and accumulation that might arise when fixing sentences for different offences.82 There is an increase of the totality of the criminality by the prisoner’s conduct after he escaped from his motor vehicle. I have already pointed out that the first resistance of Senior Constable Williams is the more serious of the two matters. The two resist arrest matters however are very close in time and in my view they should be dealt with by concurrent sentences. I do not believe the totality of the criminality in relation to the first resist arrest is much if at all increased by the conduct of the prisoner in clenching his fists and holding his arms tight before being dragged out to the front of he premises. However, because that offending increases the criminality exhibited in count 1B, I propose an accumulation by nine months upon the sentences for the resist arrest matters by the sentence for the use offensive instrument to avoid lawful apprehension. 83 Most importantly in relation to the principal offence I am required to take into account the Form 1 matters which show a course of serious criminal conduct in itself. I have had close regard to Attorney General’s application Number 1 of 2002 ((2002) 56 NSWLR 147). There the court held that the fact that there is a matter or there are matters to be taken into account on a Form 1 means that greater weight should be given to the need for personal deterrence and the communities entitlement to extract retribution. “The entire point of the process” is to impose a longer sentence or to alter the nature of the sentence that would be imposed if the principal offence had stood alone for sentence. It was wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small, sometimes it will be substantial. However, the Court noted that the sentencing process is only concerned with the principal offence not to determine appropriate sentences for matters listed on a Form 1 or to determine an overall sentence that would be appropriate for all the offences and to apply a discount giving appropriate weight to the matters otherwise to be taken into account. The Court stated that deterrence and retribution are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. Of course there are matters which will limit the extent to which the sentence for the principal offence may be extended, the terms of the legislation, the maximum penalty for the principal offence, the principal of totality are all relevant matters. It would be rarely appropriate for a sentencing judge to attempt to quantify the effect of the sentence, that is, for the principal offence, from taking into account Form 1 matters. 84 The offences included on a Form 1 will have significant lower saliences in the sentencing process for various reasons. But a judge must be careful to assess whether it is appropriate to proceed to sentence on that basis as there may be matters where the administration of justice can be brought into disrepute by the court proceeding to sentence a person guilty of criminal conduct on a “manifestly and adequate unduly narrow or artificial basis”.85 I am required in the context of those remarks to have regard to the maximum penalty for the principal offence as with the matters in counts 2 and 3. There is no standard non-parole period as I understand it in relation to the principal offence. 86 I am required to have regard obviously in the context of those remarks to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It seems having regard to the seriousness of the offending, the context in which it occurred and of course the matters that I have already referred to, that this is a matter where there is a need to ensure adequate weight is given to deterrence, both general and personal, and a need to ensure that the prisoner is adequately punished for the offence. There is in this matter to some extent an element to protect the community from the offender. His obvious antipathy towards police in the past and in the context of the facts of this matter is a matter of considerable concern. The prisoner will need to adjust his attitude on his release otherwise there will be risks in my view for police officers particularly should the offender come within their attention. I have to make the prisoner accountable for his actions, to denounce his conduct and to recognise the harm done to Senior Constable Williams and to the other Mr Williams, although Mr Williams’ offence is on the Form 1 as are the offences of the damage to property. He also damaged property at 20 Vincent Street but of course he is not charged with any offence in relation to that. I do not have a Victim Impact Statement from Senior Constable Williams, but this must have been a frightening experience. I noted, and I believe it was entirely genuine, that at one point of his evidence-in-chief the senior constable, who is a big man and a robust man and obviously a very brave man, checked himself. Clearly the events of this day which would have caused him a great deal of distress still live with him for some time and that would be natural.87 With regard to s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I have already made observations of the relevance of s 21A(2)(d) of that Act. Obviously I am required to have regard to s 21A(1) general principles of sentencing apply subject to any further specific matters. In the legislation the Court is not to have regard to any aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence. Whilst it is an aggravating factor for the victim to be a police officer, to threaten use of violence, to threaten to use or use a weapon and the like matters expressed somewhat differently in the offence, are all included within the elements of the offence and it has not been submitted to the contrary.88 Ultimately in relation to all the offences for sentence today it is clear that a common aggravating factor is that the offences were committed whilst the offender was subject to conditional liberty. The offender was not subject to parole, a breach of which is probably the most serious form of breach of conditional liberty, but he was on bail in relation to offences involving resistance of lawful authority of the police. As subsequent events revealed at the courts, he was guilty of those offences as well.89 I do not believe any other aggravating factors were urged. It may be fairly said that the injuries suffered by Mr Williams that were exhibited in the photographs that were tendered were substantial, in that they were of substance, but I have no evidence that the injuries were life threatening. Certainly they were not nor am I provided with any evidence that they had any permanent consequences. The only matter that seems to linger is the emotional effect of the prisoner’s conduct but I have taken that into account in a more general sense.90 With regard to mitigating factors I find that the offences were not planned offences. Otherwise the only other matter that I can conclude is a mitigating factor under s 21A(3) is the plea of guilty of the offender. I note in relation to the pleas of guilty the offender however is entitled to a discrete discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas. It was agreed by the Crown as I understood his submission, given the history of the litigation and the restrictions upon the capacity of the prisoner to plead to the relevant charges, that the range of discount should be between fifteen and twenty per cent. Ordinarily a plea of guilty at trial would attract a discount not much greater than, and usually around, ten per cent. But it is clear on the evidence available to me that the prisoner was charged with the serious offence of attempted murder and the opportunity of pleading to the alternative count was a restricted. It, in reality, only arose on arraignment in the District Court or on the commencement of the trial and it was not suggested to the contrary by his counsel. I could not afford the prisoner in these circumstances the full discount for the utilitarian value of the plea. I must say from my memory, although I have no transcript of the sentencing submissions, no submission was made about the resist arrest matters. But for consistency I have determined in the context of the judgment of Thomson and Houlton in light of the concession of the Crown which was reasonable that the appropriate discount here for each of the offences for the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty should be twenty per cent. 91 I cannot conclude that a mitigating factor in this matter is remorse. Firstly the prisoner in the course of his evidence at the trial did express an apology or regret for his conduct. This was something said by him however, with respect, in passing and I have not had in the sentencing proceedings in my view, notwithstanding Pastor Jones’ evidence, sufficient evidence to satisfy me that the prisoner is genuinely contrite such as to satisfy what is required under s 21A(3)(i). But I do note the prisoner has expressed remorse in the course of the proceedings and has done so to Constable Williams.92 To come back to the principal offence just for the moment, ultimately, in concluding the appropriate sentence bearing in mind the salience of the matters on the Form 1, I have determined that this offence is a very serious offence of its type. I cannot conclude that it is the worst offence of its type committed by the worst offender thus requiring the imposition of the maximum penalty. The offender’s record of disobedience of the law represents disobedience and resistance to police officers of a far less serious nature than that with which I am concerned now and there is no suggestion in the past the prisoner has used weapons against police, just his tongue or his body it would seem. I am not required for the purposes of this matter, given the legislative framework that is relevant, to make a determination about the matters falling in the mid range or not. But in relation to the offence under count 1B I need only say as I said it is a very serious offence of its type and the fixing of the appropriate sentence here, of course, includes the consideration of the additional conduct in Form 1.93 It may be the case, to borrow the language of Pt 4 Div 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that if the prisoner was standing for sentence only for the first part of his conduct, that is the impetuous decision to drive at Senior Constable Williams and his car in order to get away, the conduct standing alone at that point could be viewed as within the “mid range”, given the nature of the offensive instrument he used, the fact that he deliberately struck the police officer short of having an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm and the like. In my view what substantially adds to the seriousness of his conduct was the conscious decision to turn and return driving at the police officer or towards the police officer as he sought to escape. The submission was made to me that this happened over a short period of time and the prisoner’s actions did not involve him having a great deal of time to deliberate. That is true and I bear that in mind as determining that the offence falls just short of the worst case of its type. But the truth of the matter is in my view the prisoner did deliberate about what he was to do, only perhaps for a few seconds on the first occasion, but on the second occasion over a greater period of time knowing that the police officer was injured and in a character that suggests no real regard for his welfare.94 The facts of the matter are that many of the offences that come to the courts of this type are offences, by their very nature given the elements, that involve actions that occur over a short period of time without much opportunity to deliberate. Some people can act in a way where clearly there was no deliberation, just a desire to get away without thinking through the consequences. But the prisoner had the opportunity, having struck Senior Constable Williams, to get away, at least for a limited period of time. Inevitably he would have been arrested of course. But he chose to come back and he chose to come back in circumstances where he knew exactly what he was doing. His evidence before this court, accepted by the jury, or at least raising the reasonably possibility that he was not guilty for the purposes of count 1A, showed the extent of his deliberation. I make that finding knowing full well that that deliberation did not include an intention to kill the police officer.95 With regard to the resist arrest matters so far as deliberation is concerned clearly the first of the resist arrest matters reflected a conscious and deliberate decision by the prisoner to engage Senior Constable Williams. The second matter involved a relatively minor resistance, and the criminality of that, as I said, was incorporated into count 2. 96 A crucial issue in this matter was the issue of special circumstances. I do not need to fix a non-parole period in relation to the resisting police matters because those sentences will be eventually overtaken by the sentence for the principal offence. I have determined, however, that I should make an adjustment of the non-parole period to be fixed in this matter for the prisoner for a range of reasons, notwithstanding the objective seriousness of the offences. That is one factor that is relevant to fixing a non-parole period, because one is to ensure that one does not fix a non-parole period that inadequately addresses the need for the prisoner to remain in full-time custody for a minimum period. 97 But here the features that are relevant are these: firstly, there is to be a partial accumulation of sentence, which is itself a special circumstance, and that is unarguable. Secondly, this prisoner, whilst he has been in gaol before and whilst he has committed many offences in the Local Court, has never sentenced in a superior court, if I be so bold as to call the District Court a superior court, and certainly has not been subject, as I understand it, to any sentence involving a non-parole period. 98 The sentence I impose by way of non-parole period is a very substantial sentence and certainly the longest sentence he has served. The prisoner has family commitments, albeit that he is separated from his former partner, he maintains his interest in his children. He is a person who appears to have had chequered employment history. He will need professional assistance, it seems to me, to adjust to community living on his release. This is to ensure amongst other things that he does not commit further offences. 99 One would trust ultimately that the sentence I impose will have deterred him from behaving this way or even in a similar way again. But he will need assistance to find employment. He may need assistance in relation to drug and alcohol matters, although drugs and alcohol are not a feature of this particular offence. He may need assistance in relation to training and education programs, if they are suitable for him. I bear in mind of course he is a man in his mid-40s, but he does not seem to have had the opportunity or taken the opportunity to pursue such matters in the past. 100 I note that there was no pre-sentence report sought in this particular matter. I am unaware of the full extent of his contact with the Probation and Parole Service. It may be that such a report may have been unhelpful, but at the same time it seems to me that ultimately the matters that I have to decide in fixing a non-parole period are matters that require consideration irrespective of what the views of the Probation and Parole Service may be. The Probation and Parole Service may have concluded that he may require a low level of intervention or something similar. I believe such a view, if it was held, and I have no evidence of it, would be contrary to the real situation in this case. I believe the offender needs a significant level of supervision. He needs the Probation and Parole Service to address his anger management. Clearly he has an anger problem that he needs to address. 101 He also may need some medical counselling again. There is no medical evidence available or psychological evidence available to assist me in that regard and the sentencing of this offender has been difficult in that respect because as I’ve said on several occasions the prisoner’s state of mind on this occasion is not fully revealed, not from the prisoner and not from the evidence of Pastor Jones. All I really have that I can be satisfied of is a level of anger which was unjustified.102 I appreciate, of course, in making the determination I have about non-parole period, that I cannot find the prisoner has good prospects of rehabilitation. I cannot find, of course, that the prisoner is unlikely to re-offend. But the purpose of parole supervision should be, if it works properly, not only to assist the prisoner but to assist the community by endeavouring to assist offenders to avoid offending in the future and provide offenders with the skills to avoid offending. I am mindful of the fact that Pastor Jones’ community will continue to provide assistance, and that is a positive thing as well. But in my view that assistance should be marshalled by the Probation and Parole Service so the community can at least have some confidence that if the prisoner is making progress that progress is being monitored.103 I have regard, as it would be noted from what I have said up until the present time to all the submissions that have been put by the parties, I need not dwell upon the De Simoni issue raised by the Crown. Clearly I have dealt with that aspect of the matter and I am grateful for the Crown’s assistance in that regard. 104 I have had very close regard to all that was skilfully put on Mr Lacey’s behalf by his counsel. His success at the trial was very much dependant, in my view, upon the skill of his counsel, that is his success in being acquitted in relation to count 1A. The essential submission relating to special circumstances put by Mr Smith I accept, notwithstanding my disagreement with him as to Mr Lacey’s prospects of rehabilitation. I do not believe there is any need for me to go through the detail of those submissions any further than I have. 105 Thus, hopefully having covered all matters that are required now to be covered in sentencing an offender such as this prisoner, I will make the orders in relation to this matter. Sorry, Mr Lacey, if you do not mind standing up? in relation to the principal offence, that is count 1(b) - no my apologies. 106 In relation to count 2, that is the offence of resisting Senior Constable Williams, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years. That represents a twenty per cent discount upon two years and six months. That sentence will commence on 28 July 2008 and expire on 27 July 2010. I decline to fix a non-parole period for that matter because of the sentence I will impose in relation to count 1B.107 In relation to the second offence of resisting arrest you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of nine months. A discount of twenty per cent might involve a sentence of nine-and-a-half months but I have rounded the sentence down. It is effectively a discount of twenty-five per cent but only for rounding down purposes and it is academic in any event. That sentence will commence on 28 July 2008 and will expire on 27 April 2009. That sentence has now expired in fact.108 In relation to the offence, the principal offence, talking into account the matters on the Form 1, the starting point of that sentence was nine years imprisonment given the maximum penalty is twelve years and the discount of twenty per cent on my calculation leaves me with a sentence of seven years and two months. In relation to that sentence I fix a non-parole period of four years and three months. That sentence will commence on 28 April 2009 and expire on 27 July 2013. In respect of that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of two years eleven months, and that sentence will expire on 27 June 2016. On my calculation the earliest date that you are eligible for release to parole will be 27 July 2013. That is a sentence of five years. Whether you are released to parole will be a matter for the parole authorities. You may not be familiar with the parole system but I only have the power to direct a person be released to parole if the sentence is three years or less, and you will have to satisfy the parole authorities of your suitability for release to parole.

      JUDGMENT [No 1] – In the case of R v SS: re leave to cross examine a Crown witness 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: The accused, SS, is on trial for the murder of James Tautari, who died on 27 December 2007. He was, at the time of Mr Tautari’s death, 17 years old. He is one of five accused. The trial is proceeding before a jury.  
     
      
    2 The prosecution has called a witness, Miad Shahidi, who went to school with SS. Mr Shahidi described SS as “my best mate”. On Boxing Day 2007, James Tautari was attacked and beaten by a group of young men. He died the next day. Mr Shahidi was interstate visiting grandparents when the attack occurred. He returned to Sydney on 28 December 2007. On the day of his return to Sydney, he saw a news bulletin about the murder of a man at St Clair. 
     
      
    3 The following day, Saturday 29 December 2007, Mr Shahidi communicated with SS on an internet chat line. According to his statement, he asked SS what was going on. SS replied: “I want to tell you face to face.” Arrangements were then made for him to come to Mr Shahidi’s house the following day. However SS did not attend. 
     
      
    4 On 30 December 2007, Mr Shahidi briefly spoke to SS on the telephone. Arrangements were made to meet the following day, New Year’s Eve, at SS’s father’s apartment in the city. When he arrived at the apartment, a party was in progress involving some fifty people. Mr Shahidi spoke to SS. He recounted their conversation in his police statement, in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “13. About ten minutes after we arrived we were in the lounge room there [were] only few people, we had a private conversation. I said ‘what happened’. 
        
       
       
        
        [SS] said ‘we didn’t mean to kill him, we just wanted to hurt him but it got out of hand, I just hit him in the legs, I was screaming to other guys ‘don’t hit him in the head’.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I was little shocked at what he had told me and I didn’t speak for about ten minutes, because I knew the man had died the next day. 
        
       
       
        
        After a little while I said ‘don’t worry you tried to stop it, I know it was not your fault’. 
        
       
       
        
        [SS] said ‘it was out [of] control people were just hitting him in the head, he just would not go down I was hitting him in the legs. One guy was hitting him in the head and he would not go down.’” 
        
       
      
    5 The statement continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “14. Around midnight [SS] started crying and he said ‘I won’t be able to see my brothers grow up now’. 
        
       
       
        
        The following morning I left about nine or ten a.m. and I went home. [SS] was sleeping when I left. [SS] did not tell me who else was involved and I did not want to know so I didn’t ask.” 
        
       
      
    6 That statement was made by Mr Shahidi on 4 January 2008, that is, within a matter of days of the conversation taking place. Mr Shahidi subscribed his signature to each page of the statement, which began with these words: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. This statement made by me accurately sets out the evidence that I would be prepared, if necessary, to give in court as a witness. The statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I will be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything that I know to be false, or do not believe to be true. 
        
       
       
        
        2. I have not told any lies in this statement.” 
        
       
      
    7 Mr Shahidi was called as a witness by the Crown. He acknowledged communicating with SS before New Year’s Eve by means of the chat room. He was unsure of the terms of their conversation. He agreed that he went to the city to SS’s father’s apartment and saw SS. He agreed he spoke to him. When asked about the terms of their conversation, Mr Shahidi said this: (T 348) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did [SS] say something to you about something that had happened?  
         
        A. I don't really remember the conversation we had that night.  
        He just told me like they were involved in a, like I basically knew that someone from St Clair had been bashed and I only just knew that they were all involved 
        , that sort of thing, but I didn't really get into it, but I then made a statement saying that - like - he told me a story but that was like 2 years ago and my parents pretty much forced me to make a statement because they seen coppers at the front of the door, they said like just go make a statement say whatever so I was just standing there, I wasn't thinking really straight, just pretty much made a little story up, just come out of the cop station.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. Are you saying that what you said in your statement was something you made up?  
         
        A. Pretty much.” 
        
       
       (emphasis added) 
       
      
    8 Mr Shahidi was then shown his statement, which he identified. He said this: (T 349) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Is that your statement?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. That you made to the police on the fourth January 2008?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. After you came back from Melbourne?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. And a few days after you went to [SS’s] father's house?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. And are you saying that what is contained in that statement you made it up?  
         
        A. Not all of it, just when I met [SS] and we talked about it like when I first, basically it is pretty much after I went to [SS's] house. I didn't make that up, just, wasn't really from [SS] just what other people told me, but still stories from other people.” 
        
       
      
    9 At that point the jury retired. Evidence was then taken on the Voir Dire. Mr Shahidi’s attention was drawn to his account of his conversation with SS. He said this: (T 356) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Just so that it's clear, you say that's not what [SS] said? 
         
        A. No, that's what other people told me but I said in the statement that's what [SS] said.” 
        
       
      
    10 When taken to each page of the statement, Mr Shahidi acknowledged it was accurate, apart from paragraph [13], which incorporated what others had told him, not SS (T 357-359). His evidence included the following: (T 359) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. All right, and, is the whole of 13 or only part of it untrue?  
         
        A. Yeah it is just what other people told me, not [SS].” 
        
       
      
    11 The Crown, in these circumstances, sought leave to cross examine Mr Shahidi under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995, as an unfavourable witness. Mr Austin of counsel, for SS, acknowledged that Mr Shahidi was unfavourable and that the trigger for s 38(1) had been satisfied (T 360). He submitted, however, that in circumstances where the witness had withdrawn the suggestion that SS had made admissions, his account in his statement of 4 January 2008 had “no weight”. He asked that it be excluded as a matter of discretion under s 137 of the Act. Attention was drawn to Lee v The Queen [1998] HCA 60; (1998) 195 CLR 594, and especially paragraphs [25] and [41]. Having resiled from his police statement, Mr Shahidi’s assertions in that statement, according to counsel, went only to his credit. He submitted that the following words of the High Court in Lee v The Queen had direct application: 
     
      
       
        
        “41. Evidence of Mr Calin’s prior statements of what the appellant had said should not have been admitted as evidence of the truth of the confession allegedly made by him to Mr Calin.  
        Because those prior statements of what the appellant had said went only to Mr Calin’s credit, the trial judge could either have rejected those parts of the statements (s 137) 
          
        or, if that course was not followed, would have had to give clear directions to the jury about the very limited use to which they could be put. 
          
        In the circumstances of this case, the former course was to be preferred 
        .” 
        
       
       (emphasis added) 
       
      
    12 However, there are, I believe, important differences between the facts in this case and Lee v The Queen. In Lee the prosecution witness, Calin, gave a police statement which he signed. It included a conversation with Lee where Lee was alleged to have said to him these words:  
     
      
       
        
        “6. ‘4 ... leave me alone, cause I’m running because I fired two shots.’ I said, ‘What do you mean you fired two shots.’ He said, ‘I did a job and the other guy was with me bailed out.’” 
        
       
      
    13 When he was called by the Crown during the trial, Calin said that, apart from pressing Lee to repay money owing to him, he could not recall any other conversation. His attention was drawn to the statement, which he denied making. The High Court noted the following:  
     
      
       
        
        “9. ... Trial counsel contended that although Mr Calin had signed the document he was affected by alcohol at the time, he had not read it or understood it and he signed it simply to be able to leave the police station. ...” 
        
       
      
    14 The Court added: 
     
      
       
        
        “11. The prosecution then cross-examined Mr Calin in front of the jury. Mr Calin admitted signing the document that had been prepared by the police but denied that the statements in it were his. The police officer who prepared the written statement gave evidence of the taking of the statement. Another officer deposed to Mr Calin having made a similar oral statement to him. The written statement that Mr Calin had signed was tendered in evidence.” 
        
       
      
    15 In the context of that case, the need for the prosecution to prove Calin’s statements added another layer in terms of the representations relied upon by the Crown. That created difficulties in respect of the hearsay rule and the requirement that admissions be first hand (s 82 Evidence Act). Here, however, there were no such difficulties. Mr Shahidi acknowledged that he made the police statement. He agreed that, on 4 January 2008, he told the police, amongst other things, that SS had said to him: “We didn’t mean to kill him, we just wanted to hurt him but it got out of hand, I just hit him in the legs.” The Crown asserted, in these circumstances, that the following statement by the Court in Lee, which was in parenthesis, had application: 
     
      
       
        
        “29. ... (Of course, it would be different if Mr Calin had said in evidence in court that the appellant had said he had done a job. Then the representation made out of court would be the appellant’s, not Mr Calin’s.)” 
        
       
      
    16 In the course of argument, counsel for SS ultimately did not oppose the Crown cross examining Mr Shahidi on the Voir Dire in the absence of the jury (T 364). He submitted that if, through cross examination, the witness capitulated and acknowledged that SS had made the admissions attributed to him in his police statement, the evidence could then be given in front of the jury. If he did not then, according to counsel for SS, the problem raised by Lee v The Queen would remain. In accordance with the High Court’s judgment, the statements he made to the police, inconsistent with his testimony, would go only to Mr Shahidi’s credit. For the reasons given in Lee v The Queen, the statements should be excluded as unfairly prejudicial (s 137). 
     
      
    17 Having heard argument, I made a number of rulings: (T 370) 
     
      
       
        First, that the Crown should have leave to cross examine Mr Shahidi on terms which were defined. 
       
       
        Secondly, that the cross examination should take place in the presence of the jury. 
       
      
    18 So far as the first aspect is concerned, there was, as mentioned, no contest. The issues under s 38(1) and s 192(2) of the Evidence Act were canvassed (T 360-362). In respect of the second matter, the ultimate issue for the jury will be whether they accept SS told Mr Shahidi: 
     
      
       
        
        “We didn’t mean to kill him, we just wanted to hurt him but it got out of hand, I just hit him in the legs, I was screaming to the other guys, ‘Don’t hit him in the head’” (supra para [4]) 
        
       
       
      as he acknowledged to the police on 4 January 2008 or whether (as he suggested in his evidence before the Voir Dire), that his account “wasn’t really from [SS], just what other people told me, but still stories from other people” (T 349) (supra para [8]). It was my view that the jury, in making its determination, was likely to be greatly assisted by seeing Mr Shahidi cross examined. The jury will ultimately be told that, before they can rely upon the evidence of Mr Shahidi as part of the material against SS, they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that SS did say the words attributed to him by Mr Shahidi in his police statement made shortly after their conversation. They will also be told that, if there is any reasonable possibility that the account which Mr Shahidi acknowledged he gave to the police at that time was based, not on what SS said to him, but what others had attributed to SS, they must disregard the evidence. In that circumstance it should be given no weight. 
       
      
    19 I should add that, given the difference between the facts in this case and Lee’s case, I do not accept that the only circumstance in which the Crown could ask that the evidence be placed before the jury is if Mr Shahidi were to capitulate in cross examination and acknowledge that SS said the words set out above, or words to that effect. In my view, it is an issue for the jury as to which version of Mr Shahidi’s account they accept, and whether they are satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the words of SS, which he included in his account to the police, were based upon conversations with other people. 
     
      
    20 I should deal specifically with s 137. It will be noticed (T 348, supra para [7]) that Mr Shahidi, in his evidence, acknowledged that he had a conversation with SS on New Year’s Eve and that SS “told me like they were involved”. The words of SS, repeated to the police (as recorded in his statement), are simply an elaboration upon that involvement. Indeed, they are an elaboration which is exculpatory (“We didn’t mean to kill him, we just wanted to hurt him but it got out of hand, I just hit him in the legs, I was screaming to other guys ‘don’t hit him in the head’.”) (supra para [4]). The evidence, I believe, has significant probative value. In the context of the direction which I propose, the probative value is not significantly outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. 
     
      
    21 As it happens, when Mr Shahidi resumed his evidence in front of the jury and was cross examined by the Crown, he appeared to alter his stance. Whilst he answered many questions by simply saying that he had no memory of the conversation, he did not again assert that what he had said to the police was the product of conversations with others, not SS, although he did say in cross examination it could have been (T 407, 410). However, he gave the following evidence: (T 406) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Would you agree that your memory would have been better back in the 4th of January 2008 than it is now?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. And you would agree, wouldn't you, that you didn't tell any lies to the police when you made your statement, did you?  
         
        A. No.  
         
         
        Q. You told the truth, didn't you?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. What is recorded in your statement is in fact what happened, isn't it?  
         
        A. Yes.” 
         
        
       
      
    22 On the test postulated by counsel for SS, that acknowledgement by Mr Shahidi would, in any event, have justified the reception of the evidence, had it been taken on the Voir Dire.

   REMARKS ON SENTENCE1. The New South Wales Parliament a few years ago introduced a new law which made car re-birthing a specific crime. The new law was s 154G(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. It was a crime called knowingly facilitating organised car re-birthing activities. Parliament fixed a maximum sentence of fourteen years imprisonment. They regarded it as so series a crime that they also fixed a standard non-parole period of four years to the crime. 2. Each of Mr Mohamad Hello and Mr Hussein El-Skaf I am sentencing today for that crime.3. When the new law was brought into Parliament the Minister said this about the new law: 
     
      
      “ 
      There are many costs of re-birthing to the community. Firstly, re-birthing means that the stolen vehicle will not be recovered, in contrast ‘joy riding’ - style car theft, where the vehicle is usually recovered. This results in the true owners being deprived of their cars permanently, and higher insurance premiums for us all. In addition, if a re-birthed car that has been on-sold is subsequently identified, seized and taken back to its true owner, the honest buyer who paid market price for the car may be left with nothing. Secondly, re-birthing is dangerous. It may involve serious physical alterations to the car, such as grafting the front-end of one car to the back end of another. This creates a structural flaw which in an accident could mean that the car disintegrates with its innocent new owners inside. Thirdly, because car re-birthing is potentially lucrative, it entices young people into becoming involved with organised criminal gangs. It can corrupt legitimate tradespeople who work with vehicles, because re-birthing gangs actively seek to ‘recruit’ professionals working in the industries of motor vehicle repair, wrecking, sale and registration. These people can provide the paperwork to give the re-birthers illegal activities the veneer of legitimacy.” 
       
       
      
    4. In a case about case re-birthing in this State’s Court of Criminal Appeal - but not under the new law - the Chief Judge at Common Law in R v Mason [2007] NSWCCA 32 said at [19] - 
     
      
      “ 
      Regrettably this type of illegal enterprise is not uncommon. It inflicts considerable loss on those members of the community whose vehicles are stolen, as well as inflicting loss on any insurer who may have obligations to provide compensation.” 
       
      
    5. In this case Mr Hello and Mr El-Skaf became part of a car re-birthing enterprise where two co-offenders named Mr Bakkour and Mr Javelosa took orders for cars from friends and relatives and drove around the suburbs of Sydney stealing those cars to meet the orders. The cars were taken back and hidden and taken apart so that their parts could be used to re-birth a car.6. Mr Hello ordered two specific cars from Mr Bakkour. He ordered one in March 2007 and another in April 2007. The first was worth $7000 and the second $25,000. A fresh car was re-birthed using parts from the cars which Mr Hello had ordered. The first car was resold for $5000 and although he resold the second car for $14,000 he had to return the money because the car did not work properly. 7. Mr Hello has been charged under s 154G(1) with knowingly facilitating organised car re-birthing activities and in addition he has asked me to take into account under a form in accordance with s 32 of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 an offence of knowingly making a false statement to the Roads and Traffic Authority. I will take that other offence into account because he has pleaded guilty to it and I will sign the certificate. The re-birthing activity which Mr Hello is charged with, he has admitted, occurred between 19 March 2007 and 27 July 2007 when he was arrested.8. Mr El-Skaf’s house was used to hide a number of the cars which had been stolen so that they could be stripped and put on to other cars. Mr El-Skaf has acknowledged in his plea that he was involved in seven cars being dismantled but there is no evidence of him being involved in any re-assembling of the cars. He was arrested on 19 July 2007. He had one night in custody. 9. After Mr Hello was arrested on 27 July 2007 he had two nights in custody. 10. When I sentence each of them I will take those times they have already served in custody into account.11. Mr Hello was committed for trial. He pleaded guilty on the day of the trial on 13 July 2009. Mr El-Skaf pleaded guilty after some negotiations with the prosecution. After his one night in custody Mr El-Skaf was on bail but reporting to the police up to four times a week and the subject of a curfew. 12. Before considering the personal circumstances of each offender I need to assess how bad these particular crimes were as examples of this offence. As I said, Mr Hello was involved because he ordered two cars, but he was involved in some activities with those two cars doing some repairs and arranging for them to be registered and sold. His involvement was therefore quite significant. Mr El-Skaf, as I said, dismantled seven cars. His motive was because he needed money for his family and he got involved when somebody asked him, “Do you want to make easy money?” In my opinion the crime committed by Mr Hello was in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. It was not as serious a crime as that committed by his co-offenders Mr Bakkour and Mr Javelosa. Mr El-Skaf’s involvement in the crime also indicates that his offence was in the middle of the range of objective seriousness in my opinion. In both cases because of the limited number of cars they were involved in their offences were towards the lower end of the middle range. 13. Mr Hello, as I said, pleaded guilty on the day of his trial. Mr Vautin, who appeared for the prosecution, said that it was a late plea entered after negotiations and should attract only ten or fifteen percent discount. Mr Martin, who appeared for Mr Hello, referred to some decisions in the Court of Criminal Appeal and argued that his client had originally been charged with some seven offences when he first cam before the District Court, but it was now reduced to one offence with a Form 1. He argued that in the circumstances he pleaded guilty at the first opportunity which was available to him once the charge had been settled. I propose to accept Mr Martin’s submission and in due course for Mr Hello I will discount his sentence by twenty-five percent because he has made the administration of justice easier by pleading guilty to a significant charge. 14. Mr Vautin argued regarding Mr El-Skaf that his plea of guilty was after negotiations and should attract only ten to fifteen percent. Mr Jankowski, who appears for him, argued that it should be above fifteen percent, but acknowledged that it was not a top of the range plea of guilty. I regard an appropriate discount in the circumstances of Mr El-Skaf’s case as being fifteen percent for him pleading guilty. And when I sentence him I will discount his sentence by fifteen percent.15. I turn now to Mr Hello’s personal circumstances. He is now aged twenty-seven and came from Lebanon in 2004. He is married with a two year old child who was born at the time that he was committing this crime. That child has some medical problems. The relationship between him and his wife, who was the only witness called, has been troubled in the past but is now more stable. He was employed full-time as tiler and has a good work reference. His wife acknowledge that he has matured a lot recently. 16. He has had a number of traumatic events occur in his life which are referred to, helpfully, in a report by a clinical psychologist Dr Mark Milic dated 24 August 2009 which became exhibit 13. He has witnessed people being shot as well as being involved in a family trauma when his father was imprisoned as a result of an argument with the local police in Lebanon. He has himself (Mr Hello) been involved in a car accident and in 2005 received the news that his brother had been shot. Mr Hello has been diagnosed as having an adjustment disorder and depression. 17. He has one prior conviction for a common assault which was committed in 2002 which is an insignificant record. He has a character reference and although his wife said that he would not re-offend it seems from her evidence that the concern was more that he had mixed with and trusted the wrong people. Indeed the impression I got was that his wife still believes that he is innocent and she had not seen the part of exhibit A in this case which were the facts agreed between the prosecution and the defence upon which I would sentence him. There is limited evidence or remorse; in fact the only evidence would appear to be from the plea of guilty. 18. Turning to Mr El-Skaf. He is aged twenty-three and was also born in Lebanon. He came to Australia in 1996 with his wife and became an Australian citizen in 1999. He has three sons all of whom have diagnosed particular problems. The three sons are twelve year old Mohamad, eleven year old Fouad and six year old Khaled. They have exhibited traits of violence to teachers and students at school. Mr El-Skaf, who was called as a witness by Mr Jankowski, said the medication they receive sometimes helps but not always. The boys have been violent to their mother, in particular the eldest -twelve year old Mohamad - who is larger than his mother, and who does not respect his mother; he has some respect for his father who is better able to manage him. Both Mr El-Skaf and his wife have some family in Australia but both families are very busy and preoccupied with their own particular domestic problems often involving children. Mr Jankowski also called as a witness Mr El-Skaf’s wife, Ms Rifai. Mr El-Skaf acknowledged in his evidence his remorse which I accept. He realised he had hurt a number of people including his own family and insurers and the people who had lost their cars. There was evidence from Ms Rifai of how difficult the boys were to control and of the importance of Mr El-Skaf being in the household. They own their own home and are paying a mortgage of some $1000 a week, but the importance of Mr El-Skaf is that he is better able to manage the boys, all of whom have had experience of being suspended by their schools. The hardship would increase when the boys go to various schools next year.19. Mr Taylor, an experienced psychologist, says that Mr El-Skaf not being in the household will be a very great burden on his wife and family. And Dr Mansour said that there was “no way the mother alone could control the boys without the father” and that his absence would result in “absolute chaos in their behaviour.” Ms Rifai, whom Dr Mansour is treating, herself, understandably, suffers from stress and anxiety. Mr El-Skaf has no criminal record and his presentence report contained an open and frank acknowledgement of his role and evidence of remorse which, as I said, was also contained in his own evidence as well as in the plea of guilty and in Mr Taylor’s report. He has a low to moderate risk of recidivism assessed by Mr Taylor and also good prospects of rehabilitation. He has been diagnosed as having a stress and anxiety disorder and a major depression due to his dysfunctional family and the circumstances in which he finds himself. He has a limited education and has had limited employment in Australia because of his lack of understanding of English. His family are in difficult financial circumstances and they receive government benefits. He has a good character referee who vouches for him.20. Mr Jankowski argued that the hardship which would be caused to the family by him being sent to gaol full-time is so bad is that I should impose a sentence of home detention if it assessed as appropriate or periodic detention. I do not accept that submission. One reason is the evidence given by Mr El-Skaf and his wife in cross-examination by Mr Vautin where they both acknowledged that despite the difficulties, his wife would not give up on their children and she would do her best to see that they were properly treated and educated. Another reason is that I regard his participation in the crime as so serious that in my opinion a sentence other than full-time custody would not be appropriate.21. So far as Mr Hello is concerned, taking into account his involvement in the crime and the offence that he has pleaded guilty to on the Form 1, I assess an appropriate overall sentence as being six years imprisonment. However, he has pleaded guilty and made the administration of justice in this State more manageable and I propose to discount his six year sentence by twenty-five percent, so his final sentence will be fifty-four months that is, four and a half years. The non-parole period is normally three-quarters of the full sentence, so that his non-parole period would normally be three and one-third years, but because he will need to concentrate on his rehabilitation and because this is his first time in custody I am going to reduce that non-parole period to two and a half years so that Mr Hello’s final sentence will be four and a half years with a minimum of two and one half years to serve.22. So far as Mr El-Skaf is concerned I assess his involvement in the crime as well as his personal circumstances as warranting an overall sentence of the same namely, six years. In his case I discount that sentence because of his willingness to plead guilty by fifteen percent which would reduce the sentence to just over sixty-one months, but I will round that off to five years. For a sentence of five years the non-parole period would normally be three and three quarter years representing seventy-five percent of five years, but because this is his first time in custody and he has good prospects of rehabilitation and not overlooking the needs of his family to a limited extent, I would reduce his sentence as well to two and one half years, so that his final sentence will be five years with two and one half years to serve.23. Mr Hello, I am going to sentence you now, if you would stand up please. Mohamad Abdo Hello I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to commence on 17 September 2009 and to expire on 16 May 2012; the balance of the term will be two years to commence on 17 May 2012 and to expire on 16 May 2014.24. Mr El-Skaf, if you would stand up. I set a non-parole period for your sentence of two and one half years to commence on 18 November 2009 and to expire on 17 May 2012; the balance of the term will be two and a half years to commence 18 May 2012 and to expire on 17 November 2014.HIS HONOUR : Miss Ervin, Mr Jankowski and Mr Velcic, now mathematics.ERVIN: Sorry your Honour, just to confirm, did you say 17 September or17 November for Mr Hello.HIS HONOUR: I said 17 November, but I’m wondering if that’s right.ERVIN: That would be--HIS HONOUR: Did I say September? It should have been November. I said September for Mr Hello and it should have been November, and I’ll explain it to Mr Hello in a moment. Mr Hello’s sentence commences 17 November 2009 and the non-parole expires 16 May 2012; additional term 17 May 2012 to 16 May 2014. So take your time. There’s two questions I’ll ask all of you first, whether there’s any factual errors which I have made and secondly, whether the mathematics are correct? Mr Jankowski?JANKOWSKI: Your Honour indicated that my client was 23 years of age. He’s in fact 33.HIS HONOUR: Thank you, I have written 23; you’re quite right. I can see where the error’s made. He’s born in 1976.JANKOWSKI: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: You’re quite right; it should be noted that he is 33 years of age. Thank you.JANKOWSKI: Thank you your Honour, and the maths appear to be correct your Honour for my part.HIS HONOUR: Does the maths work out?VELCIC: Yes the maths appear to be correct your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Mr Velcic, okay. Ms Ervin?ERVIN: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Any other factual matters?JANKOWSKI: Not from my part.VELCIC: No.HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Hello has, Ms Ervin, a number of other matters which are in the system, we’re wondering what happens to those?ERVIN: Your Honour I did enquire as to whether there was a s 166 certificate or anything but nothing is indicated.HIS HONOUR: Because the registry will need to know what to do with them.VELCIC: There was a consolidation in respect of the primary matter and as I was - I thought that all other matters were resolved by that consolidation. There should be nothing further outstanding. The only matter that was potentially outstanding was the s 32 matter your Honour, and that was the basis of the plea and Ms Seto, the Crown Prosecutor, did a very detailed factual situation as your Honour can see.HIS HONOUR: Yes, so for some reason the other matters appear in the system, disposing of motor vehicle parts, theft, dishonestly possess, interfere with unique identifier, steal motor vehicle and there’s a number of them, and I’m sure what Mr Velcic says is right--ERVIN: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: --but the registry is going to want to know, apparently, what they do with those. Is that something you - well, no, we’d better sort it out now because Mr Velcic--ERVIN: Your Honour I would propose withdrawing them, however, without having instructions I’m reluctant to do that, but I suspect that that is the action that will be taken. Given the time, I don’t know whether Mr Velcic would approve of it being or would consent to it being done in chambers if it is simply a case of having them withdrawn.VELCIC: I’ve no difficulty with that your Honour. I’m happy for that communication to take place. If we need to come back, we’ll come back another day.HIS HONOUR: Well rather than doing it in chambers we can do it in open court. I mean I’ll be here this afternoon.ERVIN: Well in his absence if--VELCIC: There’s no difficulty your Honour--HIS HONOUR: Yes in your absence, if it’s a withdrawal it will be - that’s something you consent to. If it’s anything more complicated then you need to talk to Mr Velcic and make an arrangement for a time that suits him and you.ERVIN: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Or Mr Vautin and me and sort it out, thanks Mr Velcic.VELCIC: Thank you your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Now there’s nothing else?ERVIN: The confiscation issue your Honour. The application--HIS HONOUR: Which matter?ERVIN: --I’ve been asked if they could be stood over for a month to Sydney--HIS HONOUR: Sure, which matters are these?ERVIN: As far as I understand it’s in regards to all four matters, the confiscation application--HIS HONOUR: All right, so that there are applications for confiscation orders is that right for all of them?ERVIN: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: And you’re asking for them to go over for a month?ERVIN: Yes your Honour to the 3.1 list in Sydney.HIS HONOUR: Are there proceedings; have proceedings been commenced?ERVIN: No, that’s why we’re asking for a month so that that can be properly attended to.HIS HONOUR: I can understand that, but what am I standing over because there’s no proceedings, if you see what I mean. Until there’s an application there’s no - the sentence proceedings have just finished, do you see the point?ERVIN: Your Honour I do apologise--HIS HONOUR: No that’s all right.ERVIN: Those are my instructions.HIS HONOUR: Yes I understand; no, well I’m not going to. I would think that if you lodge an application or a series of applications that the court will list them at some stage and then bring the offenders in and the lawyers in, but I don’t think I can adjourn them without proceedings because--ERVIN: Your Honour may I have a moment.HIS HONOUR: Yes you may.ERVIN: Your Honour I understand the issue. There’s nothing I can do in this respect--HIS HONOUR: No nothing more you can say--ERVIN: --no, because I’ve got no papers and as far as I know they’ve not been made yet.HIS HONOUR: No, I understand. I won’t stand the matters over because there’s nothing to stand over, but thank you.ERVIN: Thank you your Honour.25. Mr Hello, your sentence commenced on 17 November 2009 and it finishes on 16 May 2014, do you understand?OFFENDER HELLO: Yes.26. Your minimum time in gaol is from 17 November 2009 to 16 May 2012; 16 May 2012 is the first date upon which it appears you’ll be eligible for parole. Whether you get parole or not is up to the Parole Authority. After parole your overall sentence expires on 16 May 2014.27. Mr El-Skaf, your sentence commenced on 18 November 2009 and the overall sentence expires five years later on 17 November 2014; the minimum time in gaol is from 18 November 2009 until 17 May 2012; 17 May 2012 is the first date on which it appears you will be eligible for parole. Whether you get parole or not depends on the Parole Authority. After your parole you serve the balance of your sentence until 17 November 2014, do you understand?OFFENDER EL-SKAF: (No verbal reply)HIS HONOUR: Okay. Thank you.MATTER STOOD IN LISTHIS HONOUR: Ms Ervin, my associate has reminded me about those other charges?ERVIN: Yes your Honour, I’ve just asked my colleague to pass the message on. The solicitor who has got carriage of the matter is unfortunately in the Supreme Court at the moment, so I’ve not been able to take instructions and I don’t want the matter to be resolved without actually having clarified what the actual position is--HIS HONOUR: I can understand that.ERVIN: --so if it would suit your Honour would tomorrow morning be suitable.HIS HONOUR: Yes, that’s all right. Would you mind letting--ERVIN: Mr Velcic know.HIS HONOUR: Yes, just what you’ve told me now and that he is excused if it does not involve anything contentious, I mean if it can be mentioned by consent tomorrow so he knows what you’re going to say or whoever it is that appears, and that that’s satisfactory, just keep him informed of what’s happening.ERVIN: Thank you your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Thank you Ms Ervin. You might check with him that he doesn’t need his client here.ERVIN: Your Honour, I suspect that if it is the case that further action is going to have to be taken then we’ll need to get a new date--HIS HONOUR: You are right.ERVIN: --so he’ll be needed, but if not it can just happen--HIS HONOUR: --you are right. I agree with you; the circumstances are that - so you can mention it tomorrow and--ERVIN: If it needs to be re-listed a s 77 order can be applied for then.HIS HONOUR: Good, I agree.ERVIN: Thank you your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Thanks Ms Ervin.ADJOURNED FOR MENTION ONLY TO WEDNESDAY 25 NOVEMBER 2009

    2 In the events that have occurred, the defendant does not now oppose the making of either order and does not now object to the conditions in an amended form. He does not, however, concede that a supervision order should be made on anything other than an interim basis and expressly reserves his right to contest both the threshold question (to which I shall shortly refer) as well as to the nature and extent of any conditions attaching to an extended supervision order if in due course this Court were satisfied that such an order could or should be made. 
     
      
    3 With respect to the so-called threshold question, I am required to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that the defendant is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision. That requirement exists even notwithstanding that a defendant, such as in the present case, does not oppose the making of an order or the form of the conditions that give it content. In this respect I note that the threshold for making interim orders is lower than that for making final orders: see, for example, Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Hayter [2007] NSWSC 983 per Price J at [6] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[6] In determining whether to order psychiatric examinations pursuant to s 15(4) the court is not involved in weighing the supporting documentation or predicting the ultimate result. See  
        Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman 
         [2007] NSWCA 119, where the Court of Appeal considered s 16(1)(b) of the Act, which is in similar terms to s 15(4). The test for making the orders presently sought is similar to the requirement for a prima facie case to be made out in committal proceedings.""  
        
       
      
    4 I have had regard to the affidavits of Brett Thomson affirmed on 10 November 2009 and 24 November 2009 and to the considerable material annexed or exhibited to each of them. Those documents include, but are not limited to, a very detailed report dated 25 September 2009 prepared by Patrick Sheehan, a senior specialist psychiatrist from the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services Serious Sex Offenders Review Group. I have also had regard to the helpful and extensive written submissions prepared by counsel on behalf of both the plaintiff and the defendant. 
     
      
    5 On the basis of that material I am presently satisfied to a high degree of probability that the defendant is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision on an interim basis for a period of 28 days from the date of expiry of his sentence on 31 December 2009. To this end I have been provided with short minutes of order, in accordance with which I have been asked to make orders, to which are attached a series of amended conditions that I am informed are suitable to both parties. I consider that these amended conditions are appropriate and adequate to give effect to these orders. 
     
      
    6 Accordingly I make orders in accordance with the short minutes of order dated today, which I shall initial and place with the papers.

     Judgment 
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree generally with the reasons of Fullerton J and add the following further observations. 
     
      
    2 The sentencing judge described the offence as lying in the mid range of “objective seriousness” but toward the lower end of that range. In so doing the language used by her Honour was that which is appropriate when sentencing for an offence which attracts a sentence which includes a standard non-parole period. The present offence does not attract a standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    3 Although a sentencing judge must always identify the seriousness of the offence, caution should be exercised when using language relevant to an offence which attracts a standard non-parole period. The relevant principles were discussed by this Court in R v Way (2004) NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168: see also R v AJP (2004) NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575. 
     
      
    4 When assessing where an offence lies in the range of objective seriousness when the offence attracts a standard non-parole period it is important to put aside considerations that do not have a nexus with its commission: Way [99]. Identifying whether an offence falls within the mid range of objective seriousness or otherwise is necessary so that appropriate consideration can be given to the standard non-parole period provided by the statute. The “objective seriousness” of the offence is of relevance only to the non-parole period to be imposed. 
     
      
    5 The “objective seriousness” of an offence is a different concept to the “seriousness of the offence”, the latter expression being commonly used when determining the sentence, both total term and non-parole period (if appropriate) for that offence. Where a standard non-parole period is not provided for an offence, the objective seriousness of the offence does not, of itself, direct attention to any particular type of punishment or term of imprisonment which must both be determined after all of the relevant matters, both objective and subjective, which inform the seriousness of the offence have been considered. 
     
      
    6 I agree with the orders proposed by Fullerton J. 
     
      
    7 FULLERTON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him on 12 November 2008 in the District Court after a jury found him guilty in March 2008 of possession of child pornography contrary to s 91H(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. At the relevant time the maximum penalty provided was 5 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    8 The sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period of 1 year and 11 months to commence on 3 January 2008 with a balance of term of 10 months. At the time of sentence the applicant had been in continuous custody since his arrest on 3 June 2007 both for the offence the subject of the appeal and for breach of an interim prohibition order imposed under s 7 of the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004 in March 2007 (“the interim prohibition order”). The contravention of the interim prohibition order was constituted by the applicant being in the company of two children when he was arrested for possession of the child pornography, conduct which was contrary to the express terms of the order prohibiting him from being in the company of a person under the age of eighteen. 
     
      
    9 In fixing the non-parole period of 1 year and 11 months her Honour made some adjustment to the statutory ratio prescribed by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to account for the sentence being partially accumulated on a sentence of 10 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 months imposed in the Local Court in December 2007 for breach of the interim prohibition order.  
     
      
    The grounds of appeal  
     
      
    10 The sentencing judge found that the offence of possessing child pornography was committed in circumstances of aggravation by reason of his contravention of the interim prohibition order either by operation of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act or at common law. The applicant’s first ground of appeal challenged that finding.  
     
      
    11 The second ground of appeal challenged the sentence as manifestly excessive having regard to her Honour's finding that the offending was at the lower end of the mid range. The applicant also submitted that the sentence was excessive when compared with the review of comparable cases undertaken by this Court in Saddler v R [2009] NSWCCA 83. I note that the review undertaken in that case was before the maximum penalty for the offence of possessing child pornography under the Crimes Act was increased to 10 years by the passage of the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2008, an amendment designed to bring the possession of child pornography under s 91H(3) of the Crimes Act into alignment with the offence of producing and disseminating pornographic material under s 91H(2). 12 In support of the second ground of appeal the applicant also sought to rely upon the fact that the offence could have been dealt with summarily under the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 where a 2 year maximum sentence was available. The fact that an offence may have been dealt with summarily does not, of course, alter the fact that the jurisdiction that is exercised by the District Court in sentence proceedings on indictment is by reference to the maximum penalty provided for a particular offence by the Parliament. Moreover, as has been emphasised by this Court on repeated occasions, an offender cannot expect to rely on the potential for summary disposition in mitigation of a sentence imposed on indictment either at first instance or in this Court when the sentence is under challenge. In Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [47] Johnson J referred to that line of authority when making the following observations: 
     
      
       
        
        “No submission was advanced in the District Court urging the sentencing Judge to have regard to this factor on sentence. In any event, as decisions of this Court have made clear, there is no fixed rule when such an argument is advanced, nor is this a factor which operates universally to reduce sentence: R v El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [29]. The bare theoretical possibility of the matter being dealt with in the Local Court does not suffice: Wise v R [2006] NSWCCA 264 at [31]; R v Cage [2006] NSWCCA 304 at [31].” 
        
       
      
    13 In the present case, although the fact of summary jurisdiction was ventilated before her Honour, it was given minimal weight in the calculation of sentence. The applicant does not challenge that finding but argued that the availability of summary disposition added force to the submission that the sentence imposed was excessive. In circumstances where the applicant elected to have a trial on indictment in the District Court (as was his right under s 260 of the Criminal Procedure Act), the fact that the offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court cannot be more than a theoretical possibility that in the circumstances of this case the applicant cannot rely on in this Court.  
     
      
    The facts upon which sentence was imposed 
     
      
    14 At about 1.30am on 3 June 2007 police went to a house at Auburn and spoke with the applicant. A motor vehicle was parked directly outside the applicant’s house. He produced the keys to the motor vehicle. On the back seat was a black briefcase. The applicant provided police with the combination number. Located within the briefcase, amongst personal documents with the applicant's name on them including a passport, police found a computer disc. Saved to the disc were various images including 85 pornographic images of young females and links to child pornographic internet websites. The creation dates and times attaching to the saved files ranged from 23 March 2006 to 3 October 2006.  
     
      
    15 After examining the images, and after utilising an approach to categorising child pornography adopted by the United Kingdom Sentencing Advisory Panel according to a COPINE scale, where images are categorised on an ascending scale of 1-10, her Honour classified the majority of images in categories 6 or 7 in that they portrayed explicit erotic posing and explicit sexual activity. Some images involved more than one child. She also found that three saved internet banners contained images classified in categories 8 and 9, portraying acts of assault and gross assault upon a child, and one thumbnail image in the same category involving the penetrative sexual assault of a child by an adult male. She identified two images involving minor acts of bondage and children engaging in lesbian style activity. She noted that all of the images appeared to be female children between 5 and 10 years of age with some images involving children less than 5. She observed that some of the children did not look particularly well nourished. The utility of the COPINE system of categorisation has been recognised by the Court of Appeal in the United Kingdom in R v Oliver [2003] 1 Cr App R 28 however, as noted by Johnson J in R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; 162 A Crim R 29 at [98], a different legislative scheme is in operation in that jurisdiction. It was not suggested in that case, and was not suggested by the applicant in the present case, that her Honour's use of the classification system was inappropriate in assessing the level of objective criminality constituted by the applicant’s offending. 
     
      
    Objective seriousness  
     
      
    16 The sentencing judge described the content of the images as “most disturbing” and appropriately described each of the young children as the victims of “an evil and disgusting trade”. After observing that the applicant offered no explanation for possessing the pornographic material (having maintained his innocence of the charge in the sentencing hearing) she considered that the offence was in the mid range of objective seriousness but toward the lower end of that range.17 I have already noted that Her Honour reviewed the seized material when making her assessment of the objective gravity of the offending, and that she made findings concerning the nature and content of the pornographic material both with respect to the age of the children portrayed and the type and gravity of the sexual activity reflected in the images as a whole. These are factors that this Court has identified in Gent at [99] as bearing upon an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence of possessing child pornography. Her Honour did not refer explicitly to other relevant factors bearing upon objective seriousness also identified in Gent, namely the number of items or images possessed or whether the possession was for the purposes of sale or dissemination from which the offender might profit. It was not submitted that her Honour should have referred to these features, or that for other reasons the assessment of objective criminality exceeded her Honour's sentencing discretion. To the contrary. The applicant relied upon the fact that the number of images in the applicant’s possession was moderate when compared with the many hundreds or thousands of images that have been involved in other cases involving possession or importation of child pornography. He also relied upon the fact that there was no obvious commercial motive in the applicant’s possession of the images. The absence of both of these features in the applicant’s case, it was submitted, tended to support a finding of criminality in the lower end of mid range. I note that in Mouscas v R [2008] NSWCCA 181 this Court was satisfied that even absent features of this kind it was open to a sentencing judge, in an appropriate case, to find that particular offending was nevertheless at the upper end of a range of seriousness. The applicant’s prior criminal history  
     
      
    18 The applicant has an extensive criminal history in both New South Wales and Queensland. A detailed chronology of his offending was tendered in the sentencing hearing by consent. All of his prior sexual offending related to female children.  
     
      
    19 He was first sentenced to a term of imprisonment in Queensland in September 1999 for two offences of indecent treatment of a child under the age of 16 years. Each offence involved approaching a child in the vicinity of a shopping centre and taking photographs of the children with their genitalia exposed. He next offended in New South Wales in January 2001 when he committed an aggravated indecent assault upon a child aged 10 or 11. On that occasion he posed as a medical practitioner and gained entry to the child’s home while she was home alone. The child was asked to remove her clothing whereupon she was touched twice near the vagina on the pretext of the applicant performing a medical procedure. This offence was taken into account when the applicant pleaded guilty in 2002 to a further offence of aggravated act of indecency committed in July 2001. On that occasion he indecently assaulted an 8 year old child who was waiting outside her unit block for her mother to return from work. On 19 June 2002 the applicant was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment with a fixed non-parole period of 2 years. He was not released on parole until April 2005. His appeal against sentence was dismissed by this Court on 17 March 2003.  
     
      
    20 In 2006, as a consequence of his prior convictions in this state, the applicant became a registrable person within the meaning of the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 and was included on the Child Protection Register.  
     
      
    21 I have already noted that the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment in December 2007 for contravention of the interim prohibition order issued under the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act in March 2007. In December 2007 a final prohibition order was imposed for a period of 5 years. He remains subject to that order.  
     
      
    The applicant's subjective circumstances  
     
      
    22 Her Honour noted that the applicant was 44 years of age at the time of sentence. A pre-sentence report was tendered which detailed the applicant's family, relationship, education and employment history. In the report the applicant maintained he was innocent of the charge of possessing child pornography despite the verdict of the jury. He also denied his guilt in respect of the prior offences involving children as reflected in his criminal record and was recorded as unwilling to participate in goal based sex offender programs or to provide a referral to enable the Department’s Forensic Psychology Service to prepare a current assessment of his risk of offending. The applicant gave evidence directed to addressing what he claimed were inaccuracies in the pre-sentence report concerning these matters. Her Honour gave consideration to his sworn evidence but nevertheless considered the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were poor. There was no challenge to that finding.  
     
      
    23 The applicant provided assistance to the authorities which was considered by her Honour in accordance with s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Although she generally described the assistance as of little or no utility she allowed a discount of 8 per cent in the calculation of sentence. There was no challenge to that finding. Ground One:Her Honour erred in finding that the offence was committed in circumstances of aggravation by reason of his contravention of the interim prohibition order whether as a matter of statute under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 or at common law 24 In concluding that the pornography offence was aggravated by the fact that the applicant was subject to an interim prohibition order when he was found in possession of the pornographic material, her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is the position that I am of the view this is a matter which falls under s 21A(2)(j) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         1999: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “21A(2)(j) the offence was committed while the 
           
            
            offender was on conditional liberty in relation  
             
            to an offence or an alleged offence.”  
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Even if I am wrong in this view the common law principle remains applicable given that s 21A does not purport to codify the law in this area …. Even if the commission of this offence while subject to the interim order does not constitute the statutory aggravating factor, it would constitute an available aggravating factor at common law.”  
        
       
      
    25 The applicant submitted that although the express terms of the interim order operated to prohibit him from engaging in certain specified conduct, namely contacting any person under the age of 18; actively seeking or remaining in the company of a person under the age of 18; engaging in telecommunications with any person under the age of 18 or communicating with any person under the age of 18 either directly or indirectly, the order neither expressly nor impliedly prohibited the particular conduct inherent in his possession of child pornography.  
     
      
    26 The imposition of prohibition orders against a registrable person under the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act are, by s 5 of the Act, directed to prohibiting conduct that poses a risk to the lives or sexual safety of one more children, or children generally. For the purposes of the Act a person poses a risk to the lives or sexual safety of one or more children or children generally, if there is a risk that the person will engage in conduct that may constitute a registrable offence against or in respect of a child or children. Registrable offence has the same meaning under the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act as under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act and includes a contravention of s 91H of the Crimes Act.   
     
      
    27 The prohibition orders are protective in nature and are designed to achieve the statutory objective of protecting the lives or sexual safety of children by imposing conditions on the liberty of a person with the status as a registrable person, thereby effectively preventing that person from associating with children and providing for criminal sanctions, inclusive of imprisonment, if those conditions are breached. In my view, the position of an offender who is to be sentenced for a child sexual offence or other registrable offence committed while s/he was subject to an order under the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act is analogous to an offender who is to be sentenced for an offence of violence where the victim of the offending was designated as a person in need of protection under an apprehended domestic violence order imposed pursuant to s 16 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007, and where the offender was the person whose liberty was subject to certain non-association provisions under such an order. In my view, offenders in both categories are comparable to an offender who is subject to a good behaviour bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act or a suspended sentence under s 12 of that Act, in the sense that they are subject to a court order requiring that they conduct themselves in designated ways. While there is a distinction between the consequences of a breach of an order under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (or a breach of parole) and a breach of an order under the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act, in that the commission of a criminal offence while subject to the court’s sentencing order (or a breach of parole) renders the person liable to be sentenced (or imprisoned) both for the offence giving rise to the breach and for the original offence, while breach of the court order under the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act is an offence in itself, I do not consider the distinction to be material for present purposes. 
     
      
    28 In addition, in my view, it is not to the point that the terms of the interim prohibition order to which the applicant was subject did not specify that he must not possess child pornography. I note that none of the child specific sexual offences in the Crimes Act (NSW), or offences under the Crimes Act (Cth) where the person against whom the offence is committed is a child, and which are nominated as registrable offences for the purposes of both of the Child Protection Acts under consideration, are specified in the order as prohibited conduct. Self evidently, a breach of s 91H(3) or an equivalent or similar breach of a provision under the Commonwealth Act, constitute discrete offences and do not require specific nomination to achieve the legislative purpose under the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act. Simpson J’s observations in R v Booth [2009] NSWCCA 89 are eloquent of the wider social and political context in which offending against s 91H(3) of the Crimes Act occurs and the damage done to children who are exploited by the purveyors and possessors of pornographic material: 
     
      
       
        
        “[41] In sentencing for such a crime, it is well to bear firmly in mind that the material in question cannot come into existence without exploitation and abuse of children somewhere in the world. Often this is in underdeveloped or disadvantaged countries that lack the resources to provide adequate child protection mechanisms. The damage done to the children may be, and undoubtedly often is, profound. Those who make use of the product feed upon that exploitation and abuse, and upon the poverty of the children the subject of the material. 
         
         
        [42] What makes the crime callous is not just that it exploits and abuses children; it is callous because, each time the material is viewed, the offender is reminded of and confronted with obvious pictorial evidence of that exploitation and abuse, and the degradation it causes. 
         
         
        [43] And every occasion on which an internet child pornography site is accessed (or when such material is accessed by any means at all) provides further encouragement to expand their activities to those who create and purvey the material.” 
        
       
      
    29 For my part, I can see no justification in treating a breach of a bond, suspended sentence or breach of parole for the purposes of s 21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act any differently from a breach of an order under the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act, or for that matter, a breach of an apprehended violence order under the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act. While in the former category conditional liberty has clearly been granted to an offender “in relation to an offence or alleged offence”, thereby attracting the operation of s 21A(2)(j) by that designation, in the latter category the conditions on the person’s liberty have been imposed with the object of protecting against the risk of offences of a particular kind being committed where the potential victim is in position of vulnerability by age, in the case of the child protection legislation, or vulnerable by their social or domestic circumstances in the case of women or others at risk of personal violence.30 I draw support for this view, as did the sentencing judge, from the observations of Johnson J in Porter v R [2008] NSWCCA 145. In that case his Honour had occasion to consider whether an offence committed whilst subject to a good behaviour bond but imposed for an offence which did not provide for imprisonment, was committed while the offender was subject to conditional liberty as provided for s 21A(2)(j). His Honour did not consider that the term “conditional liberty” in the section was confined to circumstances where the foundational crime must be punishable by imprisonment. He took the view that the operation of the section embraces the common law principle that an offence committed whilst a person is subject to an order of the court to be of good behaviour is the aggravating conduct for sentencing purposes. His Honour went on to say that even if he were wrong in his construction of the section the common law principle remains applicable given that the enactment of s 21A did not purport to codify the law. I would also add that the commission of a registrable offence by this applicant is a blatant repudiation of a sentencing order imposed in 2002 which provided for a non-parole period with a view to his rehabilitation, and is a further basis for regarding his conduct in possessing child pornography as relevantly aggravated (see R v Cicekdag [2004] NSWCCA 357; 150 A Crim R 299 at [53]).  
     
      
    Ground two: is the sentence manifestly excessive?  
     
      
    31 The applicant’s claim that the sentence was excessive depends principally upon the sentence being at odds with her Honour’s assessment of objective seriousness towards the lower end of the mid range. I am not persuaded that this challenge to the sentence is made out.  
     
      
    32 A sentencing judge is obliged to utilise the concept of mid range offending, and customarily appoints positions within or outside that range as a standard or measure against which to assess objective seriousness, when sentencing for offences where a standard non-parole period applies under Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. This is in accordance with the approach mandated by this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168. However, it is neither necessary nor in most cases desirable for sentencing judges to make an assessment of the objective criminality in respect of offences not governed by a standard non-parole period with that same degree of nuance. I do not intend by that observation to suggest that there are not cases where particularity in the appointment of offending within a mid range of offending will not be warranted in order to ensure that the reasons for the imposition of a particular sentence achieve the objectives of clarity and transparency. When sentencing co-offenders it is often necessary to differentiate in this way in recognition of the need to ensure parity in the sentences imposed. In many cases, however, it is sufficient for a sentencing judge to make an assessment of objective criminality by reference to the maximum penalty, and to those other features of the particular offending that bear upon the gravity of the offence having regard to the circumstances of its commission, on a broad gradient of seriousness. 33 On any view of the various matters available to be considered by her Honour in assessing the objective seriousness inherent in the applicant’s possession of the pornographic images the offending was grave. In addition, for the reasons already stated, I am satisfied that in the imposition of sentence her Honour was entitled to have regard to the fact that the offence was committed while the applicant was subject to an order intended to protect against the risk of sexual harm to children. On the other hand, there was nothing mitigating the applicant’s offending. This is in contrast to each of the cases reviewed in Saddler. In each case relied upon by the applicant the offender pleaded guilty. The offender in Gent had no prior convictions at the age of 39 years and suffered from an “eminently treatable” chronic emotional disorder. The offenders in Mouscas, Power v DPP (NSWDC, 19 July 2007, unreported), R v Elliott [2008] NSWDC 238 and R v Jones [2009] NSWDC 8 had no prior convictions while the Court observed in so far as Saddler was concerned that his criminal antecedents bore no real similarity to the offences under consideration. It should be noted that the offenders in Saddler and Elliott also received significantly harsher sentences than this applicant. Power is of limited assistance for the additional reason that it was an appeal from a sentence imposed in the Local Court together with a positive finding that the offender was unlikely to reoffend. The offender in R v Leonard [2008] NSWDC 211 was 74 at the time of sentencing and had significant health issues, including having suffered a heart attack just prior to sentencing. The Court was satisfied that his health condition would render his time in custody more onerous. The offender in Jones was 64 at the time of sentencing and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, a “significant back problem” and prostate cancer with an uncertain prognosis. The subjective factors in each of these cases are sufficiently distinct from the applicant’s case to render unhelpful any attempt of a comparison between the sentences imposed in those cases with that imposed in the present case.  
     
      
    34 The applicant’s challenge to the sentence as manifestly excessive must fail.  
     
      
    35 Accordingly, the orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal is granted. 
       
      2. The appeal is dismissed. 
       
      
    36 SCHMIDT J: I agree with Fullerton J.

   JUDGMENT1. This is an appeal by Dennis James Orcher from sentences imposed on him by Magistrate Favretto sitting in the Bourke Local Court. A person can appeal from sentences imposed on them by a Local Court magistrate. The appeal is to the District Court, and the judge sitting in the District Court hears the matter anew and determines what he or she thinks is the appropriate sentence. 2. In this case, the learned magistrate sentenced Mr Orcher to a series of prison sentences which totalled two and a half years. His Honour specified a non-parole period of two years and one month. 3. I can quite understand why his Honour imposed those sentences. He was dealing with Mr Orcher for a number of offences to do with driving whilst influenced by alcohol and driving whilst disqualified. Mr Orcher’s criminal record for these sorts of offences is absolutely appalling. Ms White, who appears for the respondent Director of Public Prosecutions, counted twenty-five or twenty-six offences relating to drink-driving over many years. Mr Orcher is an alcoholic, and has been an alcoholic for a long time. 4. Ms Miles, who appears on this appeal for Mr Orcher, boldly submits that I should grant her client bail under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in order to enable me to assess his prospects of rehabilitation. There is a place called Warrakoo Rehabilitation Hostel. That is eighty kilometres from Wentworth, and is in New South Wales. They have a bed available for Mr Orcher from 10 January 2010.5. The offences that Magistrate Favretto was sentencing for were typical, I expect, of the crimes which he had committed on previous occasions. He was driving whilst under the influence of alcohol. On one occasion, he refused a breath test, although it seemed that he could not generate enough breath to operate the machine. On another occasion, he was driving whilst clearly intoxicated near a school. One of the offences was an assault which he committed on his wife whilst he was drunk.6. He was assessed by a psychiatrist with Justice Health, who diagnosed alcohol dependence, which has lasted all Mr Orcher’s life. The psychiatrist, Dr Cassidy, said in a report that Mr Orcher had expressed a willingness to participate in a residential rehabilitation programme. Significantly, the doctor said that a “pathway to abstinence is the only realistic option, to significantly reduce Mr Orcher’s risk of re-offending”. It is those passages that Ms Miles fixes on in making her application to bail her client to the rehabilitation centre. 7. Ms White correctly emphasises the appalling record of Mr Orcher and the question of the safety of the community. These are matters which I raised directly with Mr Orcher. She also pointed out that the latest offences were committed whilst Mr Orcher was on bail. Ms White argued that a more appropriate option would be to reduce the overall effective non-parole period and to make the attendance of Mr Orcher to a rehabilitation centre a condition of a parole fixed by me. 8. Ms Miles, on the other hand, argues that her client can be taken to the rehabilitation centre with support. She argues that I can fix strict conditions of bail to ensure that, if Mr Orcher leaves the rehabilitation centre, he will be arrested and brought back before me. She says that that will be a more effective reason to keep Mr Orcher in rehabilitation than a parole order. 9. This is a matter where I have to balance three competing purposes of sentencing. Clearly, as Ms White says, offending such as this needs to be punished in a way that will effectively deter Mr Orcher from committing these crimes again. In addition, there is a very real interest in protecting the community. As I pointed out to Mr Orcher, one of these days he is going to be drunk behind the wheel of a car when a child runs out, and he will not be able to stop in time. There is a real issue here about protection of the community. A third competing purpose of sentencing is the rehabilitation of the offender. 10. That is the one emphasised by Ms Miles, who says this is an opportunity for her client to deal with his alcohol problem. She also points out that effectively it will protect the community because of what Dr Cassidy has said, that the only effective way of stopping Mr Orcher from re-offending is for him to abstain from alcohol. He was referred to a rehabilitation centre some years ago, but was not able to secure financial support to undertake the course. 11. On balance, I favour Ms Miles’ proposal. I think it has the advantages of immediacy, so that Mr Orcher appreciates, having been to court today, that in about a month’s time he will be required to undertake this course. It also has the advantage of the prospect of long-term protection of the community if Mr Orcher can overcome his alcohol problem. 12. It is preferable, in my view, to impose strict bail conditions than make it a condition of parole. It means, if he breaches his bail, he can be arrested and brought before me. That will mean he will be taken out of the community as soon as he breaches his bail, so that he will not get behind the wheel of a car until he comes back before court, when there is a high likelihood that his appeal would not be successful. As I indicated previously, I can quite understand the reasons for the learned magistrate imposing the sentence which his Honour did.13. Mr Orcher has previously pleaded guilty, and I find him guilty of these offences, but I make an order under s 11(1)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 adjourning this appeal to a date to be fixed shortly, and I grant bail to Mr Orcher in accordance with the Bail Act, for the purpose of assessing his capacity and prospects for rehabilitation. HIS HONOUR: That's the beginnings of the order. I would like you, Ms Miles, to find out a little bit more about the course. I want to know how long it is. I want some arrangements in - something which I can make a condition for him getting there, perhaps one of the facilities that you mentioned, and perhaps you can discuss with Ms White, in light of how long the course is, when I should adjourn the case to. How long, in other words. I am sitting in Crime in Parramatta from 1 March and I’m sitting in Crime in Bathurst from 7 June, so find out about the course. I will stand the matter in the list today. You have a talk to Ms White and if you can formulate some bail conditions - If you can agree them, that’s fine, then that's all right, I will work it out after hearing from you both.MILES: Thank you, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Thank you both for your assistance. It is not an easy case. Mr Orcher, I am going to give you bail - not now - it will be from - in fact I will need to make that order - you will be bailed from 9 or 10 January. You will be in gaol until then, and you will then go down to this Warrakoo place, not far from Wentworth, and then it’s up to you. But Ms Miles will explain that. We have got to sort out the details during today, so, at some stage, you will come back today and we will finalise the details about when you go and how you get there and how long you're going to be there. Do you understand?APPELLANT: Yes.HIS HONOUR: All right, go back into custody now.SHORT ADJOURNMENT HIS HONOUR: How are you going with the Orcher - the few minutes between now and Mr Orcher coming here, will that be enough time for you two to settle?MILES: I think my friend and I are agreed, your Honour, yes.HIS HONOUR: All right, well bring Mr Orcher, please.MILES: It may assist, your Honour - I tender a document which is entitled Warrakoo Life Skills Rehabilitation Programme Assessment Committee Rules.WHITE: I have seen that. No objection.HIS HONOUR: Mr Orcher, we are just going to look at your bail, and Ms Miles handed up assessment committee rules just before you came in. I will make that Exhibit 2.EXHIBIT #2 WARRAKOO LIFE SKILLS REHABILITATION ASSESSMENT COMMITTEE RULES TENDERED, ADMITTED WITHOUT OBJECTIONHIS HONOUR: So I have to fix bail and we have to fix a date. Do we know how long this course is going to be?MILES: Your Honour, I was advised by the author of that short report previously tendered that the programme is three months, with the possibility of extension.HIS HONOUR: Right, and he is going in in January?MILES: Yes.HIS HONOUR: About the 11th, isn't it? MILES: That's correct, your Honour. The matter the Crown and I have discussed is that the matter can come back before your Honour in a date convenient to your Honour in Parramatta, for the purposes of ensuring that Mr Orcher is still in Warrakoo, for Mr Orcher to be excused if represented, and for documents to be provided to your Honour--HIS HONOUR: Progress.MILES: Yes, in relation to his progress, if that would be of some assistance, but it is something that Madam Crown--HIS HONOUR: Yes, it sounds okay to me. I’m thinking of Friday 12 March.WHITE: That's suitable, thank you.HIS HONOUR: All right, let’s start to work out some - I am able to fix bail from a future date, aren’t I?MILES: Yes. If it assists your Honour, I have reduced the four main conditions to writing. I apologise for the state of it, but we do agree to those.HIS HONOUR: Thank you.MILES: I would assume that your Honour would have other standard conditions: to be of good behaviour and the like, that your Honour would also add to that.My friend also wanted a condition that he not be behind the wheel of a car.WHITE: Not to occupy the driver’s seat of a vehicle, yes.HIS HONOUR: I notice that he is going to be transported directly to Warrakoo, but I also notice from Exhibit 2 that the first thing they do is go into detox in Mildura for a week.MILES: I would assume - and I haven’t clarified this, your Honour, but, given Mr Orcher has been in custody for some period of time, I believe that there would no difficulty with him being exempted from a detox process as it is the case that he hasn’t been consuming alcohol for a considerable period of time now, but I can clarify that if your Honour--HIS HONOUR: No, I will impose these conditions. If there is a problem, you can come back to me. So you agree to these conditions, Ms White, plus the condition about the car?WHITE: Yes, and just a general condition to be of good behaviour, your Honour, in view of your Honour’s earlier orders, yes.HIS HONOUR: Yes. 14. I make an order under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 adjourning these appeal proceedings to Friday 12 March 2010 before me at Parramatta at 10 am. I grant bail to Mr Orcher from 11 January 2010. The bail is conditional bail. The conditions are as follows: 1. That he be of good behaviour. 
     
      
      2. That he not occupy the driver’s seat of any motor vehicle for the period of the bail. 
       
      3. That he be released into the care of an officer of the Prison and Family Support Unit of the ALS (NSW/ACT) Limited on 11 January 2010 and transported directly to Warrakoo Rehabilitation Hostel.  
      
     4. That he remain at Warrakoo Rehabilitation Hostel for the entire period of their rehabilitation programme, unless otherwise directed by the manager or the manager’s delegate.  
     
      
      5. That he obey all lawful directions of the Warrakoo manager or the manager’s delegate.  
       
      6. Bail is to be automatically revoked if there is a breach of any of the conditions. 
       
      
    15. I make this order under s 11(1)(a) for the purpose of assessing Mr Orcher’s capacity and prospects for rehabilitation. Mr Orcher will be excused from appearing before me on 12 March 2010 provided he is represented by a legal practitioner. The terms of the bail drafted by Ms Miles, agreed to by Ms White, will become MFI 1 and placed with the papers.16. I direct that a transcript of all of today’s proceedings concerning Mr Orcher be prepared and made available to me and the legal representatives of both parties on or before Friday 5 March 2010.I will explain that in a moment to Mr Orcher. Is there anything else I need to attend to?MILES: No, your Honour, not from my perspective.WHITE: No, your Honour, thank you.HIS HONOUR: Mr Orcher, you are in gaol until 10 January, do you understand?APPELLANT: Yes.HIS HONOUR: 10 January, you're coming out of gaol and you're going to straight to this rehab, Warrakoo.APPELLANT: Yes.HIS HONOUR: The ALS will arrange for you to get there.APPELLANT: Yes.HIS HONOUR: It is then up to you.APPELLANT: Yes.HIS HONOUR: You're on bail. You've heard what I said. If you don't do as you're told down there, and particularly if you get behind the wheel of a car, you breach your bail; you're back before me, and, as I explained to you, chances are you will just have the sentence fixed which the magistrate fixed.APPELLANT: Yes.HIS HONOUR: It is entirely up to you, okay?APPELLANT: Yes.HIS HONOUR: All right, well good luck with the rehab.APPELLANT: Thank you.

   JUDGMENT1. These appeals against sentences by James Hillhouse include appeals against the revocation of bonds. Magistrate Dunlevy sitting in the Broken Hill Local Court on 22 September 2009 revoked good behaviour bonds which had been imposed upon James Hillhouse in the past. They were not good behaviour bonds imposed under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 but imposed under s 12. This means that the bonds were accompanied by sentences of imprisonment. 2. The issue raised by Ms Miles who appears for Mr Hillhouse is whether under s 98(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I should find that there are good reasons for excusing her client’s failure to comply with the conditions of the good behaviour bonds which accompanied the suspended sentences. 3. Mr Hillhouse had received a suspended sentence on 17 February 2009 of seven months at the Broken Hill Local Court for driving whilst disqualified. He had committed that offence on 30 September 2008. A week or so later in the same court he received three more suspended sentences accompanied by good behaviour bonds. They were imposed on 24 February 2009 for three offences which were all committed earlier that month, on 8 February 2009. There are two offences of reckless damage to property and an offence of an assault. The learned magistrate imposed a seven month suspended sentence for each of the two offences of reckless damage to property and a nine month suspended sentence of imprisonment for the assault. 4. I should have said earlier that when he first appeared, when he got his first bond on 17 February 2009 that accompanied a seven month sentence of imprisonment which was suspended. 5. Mr Hillhouse found himself back in the Broken Hill Local Court on 22 September 2009. All of the good behaviour bonds that I have referred to were revoked by Magistrate Dunlevy which meant that the prison sentences were activated. 6. It is from the decision of His Honour Magistrate Dunlevy to revoke those good behaviour bonds that Ms Miles on behalf of her client appeals.7. When an offender appeals to the District Court against a sentence imposed in the Local Court a District Court judge hears the case anew from the start. It is for the District Court judge to make up his or her mind as to what the appropriate penalty is. 8. Ms Miles needed to overcome a hurdle in asking me not to revoke the bonds which is provided by s 98 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Subsection (3) of that law says: 
     
      
      “In the case of a good behaviour bond referred to in s 12, a court must revoke the bond unless it is satisfied (a) that the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions to the bond was trivial in nature, or (b) that there are good reasons for excusing the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond.” 
       
      
    9. Before considering what it was that brought about the breach of the bond by Mr Hillhouse I should note that Ms Miles does not argue that those circumstances were trivial in nature. What she does argue is that there are good reasons for excusing her client’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond. It is therefore necessary to say what happened that brought Mr Hillhouse back to court in September this year. 10. The events giving rise to his reappearance in court happened on 8 September 2009. The police view of what happened is contained in exhibit A which includes a summary by the police of what happened on that day. At about 7:30 on 8 September 2009 police saw a car being driven along Wyman Street, Broken Hill. It was travelling at about thirty kilometres an hour in a zone where the speed limit was fifty kilometres an hour. It travelled slowly for about twenty seconds and then turned sharply to the right. The police stopped the driver and gave him a random breath test. The driver turned out to be Mr Hillhouse. He admitted that he did not have a licence. Police noticed that he smelt of alcohol so they gave him a roadside test which was positive, they arrested him and took him back to the police station where they found his reading was 0.105. He was therefore charged with driving with the midrange prescribed concentration of alcohol. Mr Hillhouse did not have a licence because he had been disqualified from driving for some time so he was also charged with driving whilst disqualified. Police noted that Mr Hillhouse said about his drinking, “I was only drinking at home.” They did note that he was unsteady on his feet and had glazed eyes and slurred speech. They thought he was moderately affected by alcohol. At the time that they detected him police said the traffic was light, street lighting was on and the weather was fine. It was a dry bitumen road in a residential area. 11. Mr Hillhouse lived at that time in Wyman Street, Broken Hill where the offence occurred. His account of what happened is contained in exhibit 2 which is a letter written by him to the court. He explained that he had had an argument some days beforehand with a neighbour and feared for the safety of his car because the argument concerned damage to the neighbour’s car. He decided that he would clean out his garage and put the car in there so that it could be secured. His brother-in-law helped. He said they consumed “roughly three beers.” He said halfway through the moving he was intercepted by Broken Hill police. Before the magistrate and part of exhibit A was a letter from Mathew Stanley who, I infer, was Mr Hillhouse’s brother-in-law. He said they had a couple of beers and cleaned out the garage. Mr Stanley went home at 7 or 7.30 and when he came back home the police were arresting Mr Hillhouse. Mr Stanley said that Mr Hillhouse drove the car from outside the garage to the median strip to clean the rest of the garage. In addition as part of exhibit A there is a letter from Mr Hillhouse’s mother who said that the car belonged to Mr Hillhouse’s wife and that her son was worried that the neighbour would cause damage to the car. He had just spent a lot of money on the car to have it ready for his wife when she got her licence. 12. There is some inconsistency between Mr Hillhouse’s account of moving the car and Mr Stanley’s, although the inconsistency seems to be minor. Both they and Mr Hillhouse’s mother focus on the fact that the two men were cleaning out the garage and the movement of the car was related to the cleaning out of the garage. 13. Ms Miles argues that those circumstances amount to good reasons for excusing her client’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond. During the course of the argument I was referred to a decision of the Court of Appeal in the Director of Public Prosecutions v Cooke (2007) 168 A Crim R 379. The principal judgment was delivered by Howie J with whom Sully J and Price J agreed. The court considered the application of the section which Ms Miles is relying upon. 14. There are two aspects of that consideration which Ms Miles draws my attention to. One is the nature of the conduct which might excuse an offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond. Howie J said at 384 ([16]) that “if there are extenuating circumstances of sufficient importance to explain the behaviour giving rise to the breach, the court can exercise its jurisdiction to take no action on the breach.” His Honour gave examples of illness or a death in the family to illustrate an example of a failure to report for supervision. If the breach was a further offence an excuse might involve extenuating circumstances leading to the behaviour. An example given by his Honour “might be driving under the influence of alcohol in an emergency situation.” Importantly his Honour immediately said after that the following: 
     
      
      “ 
      In such a case the court is considering whether the conduct represents a contumelious act of defiance or disregard of the conditions of the bond entered into with the court.” 
       
      
    15. Ms White, who appears for the respondent Director of Public Prosecutions, argues that the emphasis given by the Court of Appeal to the kind of conduct which might excuse a failure to comply with the bond have a flavour about them of necessity or urgency. There was, she argues, in this case no aspect of urgency let alone necessity. I think she is right in that submission. There was clearly no need for Mr Hillhouse, himself, to move the car. Somebody who was sober and with a licence could have moved the car or he could have arranged for the car to be protected in some other way. But to my mind the general description of Howie J of the kind of conduct which might provide good reasons for excusing a failure to comply are broader than those encompassed by his Honour’s example because his Honour said what I am to consider is “whether the conduct represents a contumelious act of defiance or disregard of the conditions of the bond.” To my mind this act of moving the car either down the road or around the block to enable it to be put into the garage, was, as Mr Hillhouse’s mother described, a stupid thing to do but did not amount to a contumelious act of defiance or disregard of the bond. Had the offence occurred further away from Mr Hillhouse’s home I would have regarded it as such an act of defiance but the fact that it occurred near his home supports the account which he and the others gave of it being a question of convenience and protection of his car and a misguided decision to drive it a short distance to secure it. They amount, in my opinion, to good reasons for excusing his failure to comply with the conditions of the bond. 16. A second argument put forward by Ms Miles turns on some discussion by Howie J in the Court of Appeal in Cooke of a decision by Hidden J in the Director of Public Prosecutions v Burrow [2004] NSWSC 433 and the South Australian decision of R v Marston (1993) 60 SASR 320. In Burrow Justice Hidden had thought it appropriate if the breaching behaviour was a relatively minor offence “to weigh its gravity against the consequences of revocation of the bond, particularly where the suspended sentence is a long one.” Howie J and his Honour refer to the decision by the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal in Marston to support that proposition. Howie J thought it “unnecessary in order to determine the present matter to form a decided view on whether the approach taken in Marston should be followed in this State in applying s 98(3)(b).” His Honour noted two important distinctions between the jurisdictions. A suspended sentence in this State can be for no longer than two years whereas in South Australia it could be three years. More significantly, as his Honour remarked “the impact of the revocation of the bond can be ameliorated in this State by ordering that the sentence that is enlivened by the breach be served by periodic detention or home detention.”17. His Honour concluded that the determination under s 98(3)(b) - despite Marston’s case - “should be made bearing firmly in mind that generally a breach of the conditions of the bond will result in the offender serving the sentence that was suspended.” His Honour went on to observe that “the principal consideration, if not the only one, is upon the conduct giving rise to the breach.”18. White pointed to passages in Cooke which emphasised the likelihood of suspended sentences coming into disrepute if courts fail to act where there had been a clear breach of conditions. The Court of Appeal had not finally determined whether to follow Marston or not. Ms Miles argued that Marston should be followed as Hidden J did and that it is relevant in the circumstances of this case. She pointed out - which I think is common ground - that periodic detention is not an available sentencing option in this part of New South Wales nor is home detention. That means, Ms Miles argues, that the consequences of the breach of a suspended sentence cannot be ameliorated in the ways that Howie J referred to. Ms White argued that even if that were an acceptable point, the consequences in this case were not so bad so far as Mr Hillhouse was concerned or not inappropriate because his history of driving offences -which is very bad - is such that the sentences of full-time custody were appropriate. In this case, Mr Hillhouse’s driving record includes offences of driving whilst disqualified but the PCA offence is the only one involving alcohol. His other offences did have their origin in alcohol consumption which has been a problem for Mr Hillhouse for many of his twenty-five years. He has received one sentence of periodic detention on a previous occasion. 19. It seems to me that this is the sort of case where if one looks at the objective seriousness of the breaching behaviour, namely, effectively but foolishly driving around the block in one’s local area, then it is a matter where a judge or magistrate may well consider periodic detention or home detention to be an appropriate penalty. I, therefore, do take into account the consequence of a revocation of the bond being that the sentence which would follow from the revocation would be disproportionate to the nature of the offending behaviour giving rise to the breach. A foolish and thoughtless act brought about a series of sentences of some months full-time detention when they might have attracted sentences of periodic detention. 20. Independently of taking into account the consequences of the failure to comply, I have already found, based upon the conduct alone, that it constitutes good reasons for excusing Mr Hillhouse’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond. My taking into account the consequences of revocation of the bond is an additional reason for excusing Mr Hillhouse’s failure to comply. 21. Accordingly, insofar as the appeals are from the decisions of the learned magistrate to revoke the bonds imposed under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I determine these appeals against sentence as follows.22. Under s 20 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 I determine each of the appeals against sentence by setting aside the sentences of the learned magistrate. Instead of those sentences, under s 98(3)(b) I am satisfied that there are good reasons for excusing Mr Hillhouse’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond and in accordance with s 98(2)(a) I decide to take no action with respect to the failure to comply. HIS HONOUR: Now, that leaves us at lunchtime so I will let you think about the next stage, Ms Miles and Ms White. I know that took a while but you raised an important point. You both argued it well and your arguments required an appropriate judgment. MATTERS INTERPOSEDHIS HONOUR: I think your client, Mr Hillhouse, can be taken back into custody and we will finish his case after lunch.MILES: Yes, your Honour.MATTERS INTERPOSEDLUNCHEON ADJOURNMENTHIS HONOUR: Ms Miles, what do you suggest?MILES: Given your Honour’s findings in relation to the previous application, a part of this appeal, together with some of your Honour’s comments in relation to the nature of the offence, and your Honour’s understanding as to how the offences came about, I would be suggesting to your Honour that what is appropriate in all of the circumstances is a s 9 bond.HIS HONOUR: That’s right, because I have disposed of all the s 12 matters haven’t I by not taking any action?MILES: That’s correct. HIS HONOUR: So that leaves us with mid range and the drive whilst disqualified.MILES: Unless I can assist the court any further, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: He hasn’t had a drinking conviction before, that’s right?MILES: That’s correct, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Or related to driving?MILES: Driving, that’s correct.HIS HONOUR: He’s had drive whilst disqualified before and had periodic detention in 2004.MILES: I should also indicate that clearly your Honour would have the time that Mr Hillhouse has spent in custody to take into account.HIS HONOUR: How long has he spent in custody?MILES: He’s been in custody - prior to receiving bail he spent 16 days - I withdraw that--HIS HONOUR: He’s in custody now.MILES: Yes, I do withdraw that, I apologise. He’s been in custody since 8 September continuously, and the 16 days is completely regarded, it would go to the bonds. He’s been in since September, so your Honour could take that into account.HIS HONOUR: I see the point, I’m just looking at exhibit A, the 16 days is related to the bond.MILES: That’s correct.HIS HONOUR: Or the s 12 bonds. He’s been in custody relating to these matters from 8 September 09 to 3 December 09. It’s nearly three months.MILES: Yes, I am not asking for your Honour to take that time into account and impose custodial penalties but taking it into account to justify the position of a s 9 bond.HIS HONOUR: What do you say, Ms White?WHITE: Well your Honour has already made findings in relation to the objective seriousness of those offences, so I don’t have anything to say, and all of the suspended sentences have expired. 23. I have set out in my judgment on the appeals from the revocation of the bonds associated with suspended sentences, the circumstances of Mr Hillhouse committing the offence of driving with the middle range of prescribed concentration of alcohol whilst disqualified. I regard those offences as being at the low end of the scale of objective seriousness because of the circumstances which I have referred to previously in the judgment. 24. Ms Miles who appears in this appeal as well argues that - given the findings about the objective seriousness of those offences and taking into account that her client has served almost three months in custody, now related exclusively to these offences - I should impose a penalty in the form of a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Ms White acknowledges the force of that submission given the finding which I made regarding the objective seriousness of the offences.25. The two offences were committed on 8 September 2009. One was driving with a mid range of prescribed concentration of alcohol, the other was driving whilst disqualified. The circumstances of the offences have been described earlier in my judgment. I propose to accept Ms Miles’ submission. 26. Accordingly under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, I determine these appeals against sentence by setting aside the sentences of the learned magistrate. Instead of those sentences and instead of imposing sentences of imprisonment, I make an order in respect of each offence that Mr Hillhouse enter into a good behaviour bond for twelve months. HIS HONOUR: Now any conditions? Does he need to be supervised or not, any other conditions?MILES: I’m not seeking supervision, your Honour. If I can indicate from the bar table, I’ve been advised that Mr Hillhouse’s job is ready and waiting for him. He is now accepted into this rehabilitation centre which he wishes to consider. I am not asking that there be supervision from Probation and Parole on the basis that he clearly has plans. From the evidence I would have been making submissions in relation to his progress towards rehabilitation. He understands where the problems are and he knows that there is assistance if he wants to take up that opportunity, but I believe he might be considering full time work for a period of time. It’s now there available to him.HIS HONOUR: Ms White.WHITE: I don’t need to be heard.27. The only condition of the bond is that he be of good behaviour for twelve months.MILES: I believe there are the standard conditions that will be imposed. He must notify the court if there is a change of address. I think there might be something else.WHITE: To appear if called upon to do so.HIS HONOUR: Part 8.28. The conditions are that he be of good behaviour, that he appears before this court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond, that he notify the registrar of this court of any change of his residential address.HIS HONOUR: Anything else?MILES: No.WHITE: Would your Honour confirm the orders for disqualification?HIS HONOUR: Do I need to do that or are they automatic?WHITE: Well to avoid any doubt, I would ask your Honour to simply make an order just confirming them, yes, because in the case of the mid range PCA he’s received a 12 month disqualification, where the automatic disqualification is three years.29. In respect of the offence of mid range PCA, I direct that the period of disqualification be for twelve months. In respect of the offence of driving whilst disqualified, I direct that the period of disqualification be two years.HIS HONOUR: Now I haven’t made any orders about the disqualifications in respect of the bond matters?WHITE: Your Honour doesn’t need to.HIS HONOUR: Both periods are to be cumulative and accumulative on any earlier periods of disqualification.30. Now, Mr Hillhouse, I have agreed with Ms Miles on your drink driving offence and the drive whilst disqualified where you drove around the block, and I have given you a twelve month bond. You will enter into that this afternoon and you will be released on that good behaviour bond. The conditions are that you have got to stay out of trouble for twelve months from today. Do you understand?OFFENDER: Yep.HIS HONOUR: You have got to write to the registrar of this court if you change your residential address.OFFENDER: Yep.HIS HONOUR: And if you get a notice asking you to come back to court, you have got to come back to court. Do you understand that?OFFENDER: No worries.31. If you breach your bond, breach any of those conditions, you will come to court before me and I could revoke the bond and sentence you to imprisonment or some other penalty, or vary the conditions of the bond or I may decide to take no action, but that’s what happens if you breach the bond. Now what happens to you next is up to you, how you conduct your life. Obviously you are looking at your life. I was impressed by what you had to say in the witness box, but it’s over to you now as to what you do. Good luck.OFFENDER: Thank you very much, sir. Thank you.HIS HONOUR: You have got to fill in that form somewhere. Now anything else?WHITE: No, your Honour.ADJOURNED

      JUDGMENT 
      
    1 On 9 June 2009 in the Local Court at Orange, the offender, Stephen Lawrence BENNETT pleaded guilty to the murder of Lee Mintern at Gowan on 28 March 2008. He was committed to stand for sentence in this Court and he has adhered to his plea of guilty. He appeared before me on 2 December 2009 when I heard and received evidence and submissions on sentence.2 The crime of murder has prescribed for it a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life (s 19A Crimes Act 1900) and a standard non-parole period of 20 years (Part 4 Division 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999).Facts3 Ms Mintern was 44 years old when she was killed. The cause of death was blunt force head injury. An autopsy examination revealed there was “massive skull fracturing” mainly to the right side of the head. There were a number of “punched out” well defined areas of skull fracturing on the left side, characteristic of having been caused by a hammer or similar implement. The right mastoid bone was partially traumatically separated from the base of the skull. This is said to be a heavy, rugged bone and the forensic pathologist’s opinion was that it would take a large amount of force to physically separate it from the rest of the skull. It was estimated that at least six blows would have been required to cause the amount and severity of skull fracturing.4 Ms Mintern’s body was found in a shallow grave at Gowan, approximately 24 kilometres north east of the city of Orange, on 13 August 2008. She had been reported missing by her son on 2 April 2008. Initial inquiries by uniformed police found no trace of her. The investigation was passed to detectives on 10 April. Exhaustive inquiries were made but there was still no trace.5 The last contact Ms Mintern had with anyone was on 28 March 2008. Inquiries in relation to her telephone showed that one of the last contacts it had was with a telephone used by the offender and that was at 1.39pm on 28 March 2008.6 The offender was spoken to by police on 13 April and he made a statement. He recounted how he had met Ms Mintern about 12 months previously in connection with the Seven Seas Takeaway food shop in Glenroi Avenue, Orange that he owned jointly with his wife. He described how Ms Mintern had attended at the shop and struck up a conversation with him. He said that he thought she was, to use his term, “hitting” on him. He saw her again some three or four months later. She took to regularly attending the shop with her partner. Somehow she found out his mobile phone number and made numerous calls to him, trying to arrange to meet him. He claimed that he agreed that they could talk as friends but insisted that he would not become involved with her. He said that these calls from her would persist for two months and then there would be no contact for months. This pattern was repeated. He said she had been in contact with him in the two weeks prior to police first speaking to him (Senior Constable Little contacted him on 4 April 208) and she was talking about separating from her partner but being scared to move out. The offender told police that he did not know Ms Mintern “that well”. He claimed that he did not even know her surname.7 The police inquiries continued. Information they gathered suggested that the relationship between the offender and Ms Mintern was not as he had described. Ms Mintern had told others of meeting with the offender on a number of occasions of an evening and being driven to areas of new housing estates where the offender was working. He worked evenings in the takeaway food shop and during the day at his job with KLMR Civil Pty Limited, an earthmoving business primarily involved in the construction of housing subdivisions.8 On 12 June 2008 Ms April Orcher made a statement to police. In that statement she said that Ms Mintern, who was her cousin, had told her about a month before she disappeared that she was “running around” with the offender. She had given Ms Orcher a handwritten note which she asked to be delivered to the offender. It read, “Steve, Please ring the Ophir [the Ophir Hotel]. There is something I need to tell you or my mobile 0413 424 839. It’s very important or I will ring your wife and let her know what happened. Lee”. Ms Orcher had not delivered the note. She gave it to police.9 Police became aware that the offender regularly travelled through the area of Gowan and Freemantle east of Orange. On 10 July a tracking device was installed in his work vehicle and the following day a warrant was granted for the interception of his mobile phone service. The tracking device revealed that the offender travelled to a particular area at Gowan. By noting the GPS coordinates the police were able to identify a precise location that he attended on a number of occasions. Officers attended that location on 5 August and found a large mound of dirt and rocks about 1.5 by 3 metres in dimension. The mound was covered with lengths of timber, a tyre, broken bricks and stones, as well as dirt which was different from the local environment.10 Meanwhile, the offender had become aware of the police interest in him. On 2 August a person known as “Trap” rang the offender and told him that two detectives had made inquiries in relation to the offender in connection with a missing person, wanting to know what the offender was doing “on the twenty-eighth or somethin’”. On 12 August a person identified as “Mr Fardell” contacted the offender and told him that three detectives were making inquiries about him. The offender told him it was in relation to a missing person and he may have been the last person to see her. The caller asked who the person was and the offender replied, “Oh, some bloody girl ... She used to ... come to the shop... she was sort of harrassin’ me for a while, and that’s what started all the shit I think”. He then described her as a, “Fuckin’ bitch of a thing”.11 A search warrant was obtained and on 13 August police returned to the location at Gowan with a cadaver dog. At 8.52am that day there was a telephone conversation between the offender and his wife, Ms Vicki Bennett, in which she related to him the news she had heard on the radio that police were starting to search for Lee Mintern that day at 8.00am. One of the first things the offender said was “Search for her where?”. She did not know but they both went on to say that they hoped that the police found her.12 It became almost immediately apparent to the police that the mound they had discovered concealed a grave. Late that afternoon as the scene examination was being called off due to fading light the offender was seen to travel towards the area at high speed. Police secreted themselves and observed the offender to drive past, turn around, and then drive back in the opposite direction. 13 The following morning, 14 August 2008, police issued a media release in relation to the discovery of human remains. At 7.35am the offender called in sick from work. The tracking device then indicated to police that he had left Orange and was driving towards Sydney. A number of phone calls between the offender and his wife were monitored. They include discussion of the possibility that the police would come around to the home looking for him, there having been news that the police had found “her body”. He stated that he had been to the location “heaps of times” and that he would get the blame for it. His wife endeavoured to reassure him that he had done nothing wrong, that he had an alibi for the entire day in question, and that he should come home and tell the police that he had done nothing wrong. He indicated a reluctance to come home because he was concerned about going to gaol but she continued trying to reassure him. 14 The offender was arrested at Medlow Bath at around 2.00pm that day. He had been heading towards Sydney but had turned around and was travelling west when he was arrested. He was taken to Katoomba police station. He agreed to be interviewed. The interview lasted almost two hours. The account the offender gave was to this effect.15 He first met Ms Mintern on an occasion when he was at the Ophir Hotel with his wife. They were sitting together playing poker machines. When his wife went to the toilet, Ms Mintern “just started nudgin’ me and tryin’ to hit on me” (Q .219). This was about 12 months ago (Q. 223). The next occasion was when he was sitting out the front of the takeaway shop and Ms Mintern came and sat next to him and harassed him. He had to ring his wife to come and intervene (Q. 219). He described a continuing pattern of constant contact from Ms Mintern for months, no contact for a while, and then renewed contact. He painted a picture of persistent harassment. He spoke of receiving calls from her in the early hours of the morning (Q. 272). She also saw him at the takeaway shop. He tried to tell her to stay away, he was married and wanted nothing to do with her (Q. 229). He said “it was always sexual” (Q. 231). “It was just harassment all the time, wouldn’t leave me alone” (Q. 232). Ms Mintern got his mobile phone number and he did not know how (Q. 235, 256, 263). 16 Up to this point in the interview the offender had painted a picture of unwelcome contact with sexual overtones from Ms Mintern. He was then asked, “Did you have a sexual relationship with Leeanne Mintern?” (Q.279). He replied, “Sort of, not, once if you can call, oh, twice, sorry if you call that a sexual relationship”. He then described two occasions of sexual activity some months before 28 March 2008 (Q. 280 – Q. 290). Later in the interview, when speaking about the first occasion when there had been oral sex, he said they had driven to a location and that she had then asked to go somewhere quieter, “’cause she wanted to do somethin’, I suppose”. He said, “I wasn’t that interested at the time but got to, to shut her up” (Q.697 – Q. 699). The second occasion was at the Wentworth Estate, a subdivision he was working at. He said he did not go there for the purpose of having sex, “I was just showin’ her what we were doin’. She asked me to take her to show her what I do, so I did” (Q. 716 – Q. 717).17 The offender said that his wife was not impressed about the contact between he and Ms Mintern, although she did not know about the sex. He was asked if he had concerns about her finding out and he said he did. He added, however, that he was not concerned enough “to do all this ... it was never in me mind to hurt her because I thought she might go and tell me wife” (Q. 705 – Q. 708). A little later he said that he was not worried about his wife finding out because Ms Mintern was always drunk, his wife would understand, and he could probably lie his way through it (Q. 736). His wife would believe him rather than her (Q. 739). Ms Mintern had spoken of telling someone about what was going on but he “tried to get it through her head” that nothing was going on, there was not going to be a relationship and he was not going to leave his wife (Q. 740 – Q. 741).18 He said that in the six or seven weeks leading up to her death he did not have any sexual relationship with her (Q. 303), although he saw her ”probably two or three times” (Q. 303 – Q. 308). On the day of her death she contacted him first, in the morning, and was harassing him (Q. 310). She was trying to see him and he kept on saying “No” but in the end he gave in (Q. 311). It got too much for him so he agreed to meet her in his lunch break (Q. 313). That morning he spoke to her by phone “two, three or four times”, he had no idea (Q. 314). This was her telephoning him (Q. 315). He was asked if he had called her back and he said, “Oh, I would of probably, yeah, I think so” (Q. 316).19 They arranged for him to pick her up at the Information Centre in Byng Street (Q. 318). He had told her it would be half an hour before he could get there (Q. 320). He was just sick of it but that he would see what she wanted, what she kept going on about, “Tryin’, I just want an end to it, I just wanted to end it, finish it” (Q. 321). He wanted her to understand that he wanted nothing to do with her (Q. 322). In interpolate here that if this is what he truly wanted he could easily have simply refused to come and meet her.20 The interviewing officers then disclosed that they had phone records which indicated that on the night of 27 March his phone attempted to make contact with Ms Mintern’s phone “quite a number” of times (Q. 357 – Q. 359). In fact, there were 12 unsuccessful attempts to call Ms Mintern that evening in a period of 1 hour 25 minutes. The offender could provide no explanation, suggesting that perhaps his wife had got hold of his phone and was trying to “find out who it is” (Q. 361 – Q. 363). He rejected the suggestion that this indicated someone who was “pretty keen to get in contact with her” because he was “tryin’ to end things off, not get keen with her. I didn’t want anything to do with her”. (Q. 364 – Q. 365). He then suggested another explanation for these unsuccessful attempts – perhaps she had called and left a message, or he had spoken to her and then tried to ring her back. Perhaps if she was at home and her husband or boyfriend was there she would not answer the phone (Q. 367). 21 The police then told the offender that the records indicated that some two hours before these unsuccessful attempts were made to call Ms Mintern there had been a 227 second call from his phone to hers. He had no idea what that call was about (Q. 369 – Q. 371).22 He was then asked about the Friday, 28 March. He had picked her up at lunchtime and driven out to the property where the body had been found. He estimated it was 25 or 26 kilometres out of town and the drive would have taken about 20 minutes (Q. 375 – Q. 377). He said they did not talk about much during the drive because she was “off her face, she was drunk and she was virtually just arguing”. It was like before, she wanted him to leave his partner and go away with him (Q. 378). He was asked why he had driven to that location and he said he had no idea, “we started drivin’ out the road just kept on drivin’. ... I know all that country out there anyway, so, so just drove out that way. ... She said just keep on goin’ straight so I just kept on goin’ straight” (Q. 383). He stopped where he did because he had had enough, it was getting too far, he had to get back to work. He was only supposed to have 20 minutes for lunch (Q. 384). 23 He then described what had happened after he stopped the car. “I was, well, she was talkin’ for a little while and again she give a head job and then she asked, started arguin’ ‘cause she straight away said, please leave your wife and whatever and come or do, I said, no, and that’s when she started” (Q. 387). A little later he said that after they arrived at the location there was conversation – “Same as always, leave your wife and come, get, we’ll move away, go away” (Q. 455). Then, “she’s said, at least you can satisfy me or somethin’, I said, oh, no, then she come around, that’s when she started. ‘Cause I said I wanted to go home, I wanted to go back. It was always the same with her, always” (Q. 457). He had earlier given a detailed account but there was no mention in that account of any sexual activity (Q. 43 – Q. 128).24 He claimed that they had been arguing when he was sitting in the driver’s seat of the utility and she was standing at the driver’s door. According to him she then went to the rear of the vehicle, obtained a hammer and proceeded to the passenger’s side. She partially entered through the passenger’s door and swung the hammer at him. She did not make contact and the hammer fell at his feet (Q. 56 – Q. 81; Q. 391 – Q. 400).25 Later in the interview, when retelling what occurred after the claimed act of oral sex he said, “Yeah, ‘cause I just, as soon as she finished I said, I’ve had enough, I want to go, I’ve had enough of this shit. And that’s when she got the shits big time, she just snaps, she’s just, she’s got a shockin’ temper” (Q. 470. Also Q. 775)26 He said that after the failed attempt to strike him he reacted straight away, “’cause I just had enough of it” (Q. 69 – Q. 70). He said, “I just, just lost me cool big time” (Q. 401. Also, Q. 74). “I was as cranky as” (Q. 405). “Oh, I was bloody cranky ‘cause she swung it at me, could of hit me in the head and bloody, anything, I would of done to her but” (Q. 406). Later he said, “Well, I just seen red, I dunno, I just lost it, I just cranky as ‘cause she had the hide to swing at me” (Q. 778). 27 He picked up the hammer and went around to the passenger side of the utility where he “hit her on the head straight away” (Q. 410). That blow either knocked her out or killed her (Q. 415). Earlier he had said, “I don’t know if I killed her straight away or not, I dunno” (Q. 89). She fell to the ground and did not move (Q. 416 – Q. 418; Q.784 – Q.785). He then kept on hitting her while she was stationary on the ground (Q. 420 – Q. 423). He was asked how many times he hit her after she hit the ground and he said, “Probably another two times or three times, I dunno, I just, it just happened that quick, it was just ... I was that cranky, you got no idea, I was shakin’ and it just happened, just, just a blur” (Q. 427 – Q. 428. See also Q. 98). Later he said that the second blow was “virtually straight away, I was just cranky, cranky as, lost a cool completely” (Q. 789). The third blow was “virtually same time, all the time nearly” (Q. 791).28 I reiterate at this point that the forensic pathologist said that there would have been at least six blows.29 The offender continued, “She, was, like, she was dead, she wasn’t, she was not, I wasn’t doin’ it ‘cause she was still breathin’. She was actually, there was no, first blow it was virtually, there was no, ‘cause I didn’t no [sic – know?], ‘cause I kept on hittin’, hittin’, about three or four times or whatever it was. Then I stopped then she wasn’t moving, she wasn’t, but she wasn’t movin’ when she first hit the ground she just, there was no noise, nothing and it was just instant straight away” (Q. 793). 30 He was then asked, “And what, what point did you realise you’, that she’d ...” and he interrupted to answer, “Well, too late then she was dead after I hit her and done it all” (Q. 795).31 He then dragged her by the feet a short distance away from the utility, dug a shallow grave and buried her (Q. 69; Q. 102 – Q. 105; Q. 432; Q. 446 – Q. 449). 32 The interviewers took the offender back to his claim of having had a sexual relationship with Ms Mintern and having engaged in sexual activity twice with her prior to the day of her death. He remained insistent that there were only those two occasions. He was then asked about the statement of a witness who said that he had picked Ms Mintern up from her house on occasions. He agreed that he had, on two occasions, but denied that these were occasions when they had engaged in sexual activity (Q. 506 – Q. 509).33 At various stages of the interview he agreed that he had subsequently visited the gravesite on a number of occasions. Once was the day after when he took a trailer load of soil to put on top of the grave. On subsequent occasions it was for the purpose of ensuring that there was no interference with the grave by feral animals. He had become aware of the police search for the body and he went for a drive to see if the police knew what they were looking for (Q. 667 – Q. 682).Rejection of offender’s version34 In assessing the credibility of the offender’s version of events there are a number of matters which must be borne in mind. First, the confession came after a time when the offender knew that the police were closing in on him. He must have been aware that it was likely he would be asked for his version and so he had time to think about what he might say. Secondly, the version he gave was not on oath and it was given in circumstances in which he could not be tested in the way he might have been if he gave evidence in court and was cross-examined. Thirdly, it is appropriate to have regard to independent evidence and assess the degree to which it confirms or conflicts with the version that he gave. Fourthly, it is appropriate to assess the version itself and to consider whether it is logical and rational.35 There are features of the offender’s account of the relationship that he had with Ms Mintern that I do not accept. He claimed that he was reluctant to engage with her. However, there is no satisfactory explanation as to how she obtained his mobile phone number. His explanation of receiving calls from an unidentified number and ringing that caller back do not ring true (Q. 272). The frequency of telephone contact with her, and in particular calls made by him to her, is inconsistent with his claimed frustration at her harassment of him. The fact that he would take her for a drive in his car on at least five occasions, including to show her where he worked, is also inconsistent with that claim.36 There were a number of calls made from his phone to her phone between 12 and 28 March 2008. There were 38 calls between their two phones on 27 and 28 March 2008. The 12 attempts to call her in a relatively short period of time on the evening of 27 March are not satisfactorily explained. I agree with the description of the interviewing police officer that this indicated a concerted effort by him to make contact with her. This is particularly so having regard to the fact that they had a 227 second conversation only 2 hours earlier, that call having been initiated by the offender.37 I am not persuaded that the offender found contact with Ms Mintern as unwelcome as he would have it. It is more likely true that he was willingly involved in some type of relationship with her that included sexual activity.38 There are features of the offender’s account of the circumstances surrounding Ms Mintern’s death which I do not accept. He claimed that his actions in killing Ms Mintern were in response to an attack made upon him with a hammer. He claimed that the killing was entirely spontaneous and not premeditated. However, his account of the circumstances of their meeting that day are difficult to accept. He claims that he did not want to meet her and that he was only permitted 20 minutes for a lunch break. There was a call made by her to him at 1.36pm. He then rang her back 3 minutes later and a conversation for 2 minutes 40 seconds ensued. Then, after ringing his wife, he left his work place and drove into central Orange where he picked up Ms Mintern and drove her 24 kms out of town. He claimed that the sexual activity that then took place was spontaneous and initiated by Ms Mintern. That he would quite randomly drive so far out of town and stop in a remote location, in a position that was obscured from passing traffic, is rather incredulous.39 The rear of the utility vehicle had an enclosed canopy (Q. 340 – Q. 341). The offender’s account is that Ms Mintern left the driver’s door area, went to the rear, opened it up and retrieved a hammer for the purpose of attacking him. Then, rather than returning to the driver’s door area, she proceeded to the passenger side and attacked him while he was sitting in the driver’s seat and as she was entering the passenger seat. I do not find this at all logical.40 The offender was interviewed by Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, on 4 October 2009. He gave the doctor an account which included features not present in the account given to the police. They included that after Ms Mintern had swung the hammer at him and missed, he thought “that she would kill him” and that “he was not sure what she was going to do next”. He told Dr Allnutt that he then held the hammer in his hand and walked around to the other side of the utility “partly to find out what she had done”. He also claimed that Ms Mintern had a bag at her feet and “he was not sure if she had something else like a gun or a knife in the bag”. Then, as he was hitting her with the hammer, “he thinks he was scared that she was going to get back up”. He did not tell the police about any of these thoughts. What he told the police was that as soon as she had swung the hammer at him he just “lost it”. The police had asked him what he was thinking while he was hitting her and he said, “Oh, I don’t know, I still dunno, why, or how I done it. I dunno, wish I didn’t, bloody hell, dunno” (Q. 794).41 The only account I have of the circumstances of the killing is what the offender said to the police and to Dr Allnutt. He did not give evidence before me. Mr Turnbull SC submitted that I should accept the offender’s account in the interview because it is corroborated wherever corroboration is possible. I am not satisfied of that. Indeed, it is more the case that where independent evidence is available it conflicts with what the offender has said. I do not accept the offender’s version as a reliable one.42 I do accept that he killed Ms Mintern by striking her a number of times to the head with a hammer. The forensic pathologist’s evidence confirms that. I am doubtful that it was in response to an attack made upon him by Ms Mintern. The offender has been persistent in claiming that it was and for that reason the possibility cannot be dismissed completely. However I am not persuaded that it is more probable than not.43 Rejecting the offender’s version as to these matters means I have no basis to draw any reliable conclusion as to why the offender acted as he did. He claims to have suddenly lost control but I am not persuaded that this is more probable than not. One could speculate about possibilities such as a motive to ensure that a sexual relationship with Ms Mintern was not disclosed to others, including the offender’s wife. I do not accept that he was relatively unperturbed at that prospect as he claimed in the interview. He had lost two previous wives because of his infidelity. One could speculate that the killing was premeditated with this motive in mind. However, any findings that I make that are adverse to the offender must be made to the criminal standard of proof, beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence is insufficient for me to make such findings to that standard. I am left with the bare fact that the offender killed Ms Mintern by inflicting at least six heavy blows to the head with a hammer for reasons that have not been satisfactorily established. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the killing was planned.44 Mr Turnbull submitted that it was a reasonable possibility that the first blow caused death, and that this blow was accompanied by an intention to cause grievous bodily harm rather than an intention to kill. As a consequence, so it was submitted, I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act causing death was accompanied by an intention to kill. However, the cause of death was blunt force head injury. There was massive skull fracturing which was inflicted by at least six heavy blows with a hammer delivered in rapid succession. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the delivery of those blows was accompanied by an intention to kill. Indeed, striking a person with multiple heavy blows to the head with a hammer bespeaks of no other intention.Objective seriousness of the offence45 It is necessary to make a determination as to where in the range of objective seriousness for an offence of murder this particular case falls. All murders are regarded as extremely serious but the circumstances in which murder can be committed are widely variable. For the worst examples there is the maximum penalty of imprisonment for life. It has not been contended that this case is in the worst category. 46 The Crown Prosecutor submitted that I should find that the objective seriousness of the offence fell “at the bottom of the middle range”. Mr Turnbull, on the other hand, submitted that it fell below the middle of the range. I am satisfied that the offence is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, albeit it at the lower extremity. It involved the brutal slaying of a defenceless woman in a remote location in a ferocious attack using a hammer as a weapon. It was accompanied, as I have found, not by an intention to cause serious bodily injury but by an intention to kill. I am not satisfied that it was a premeditated killing. If it was, the offence would be at the upper end of the midrange, or perhaps beyond.Subjective features47 The offender was born on 18 August 1960 and so he was aged 47 at the time of the offence and is 49 now.48 He has a criminal history which commenced in the Children’s Court when he was aged 15. There are a variety of convictions for relatively minor offences as an adult, most notably two counts of assault at the age of 27 and a further assault in 2007 when he was aged 47. For the latter offence he was placed on a s 9 bond to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months from 22 November 2007. That bond was, of course, current at the time of the present offence. Apart from that, the record is not of much significance. At most it denies to the offender any claim of leniency that might be justified in the case of a person with no record.49 As the offender has not given evidence the only sources of information I have as to his personal circumstances are the report by Dr Allnutt, a number of testimonials tendered on his behalf, and the oral evidence given by his sister, Ms Susan Bennett.50 He was born in Bathurst, the eldest of three children. There does not appear to have been any negative issues in his family environment. He left St Stanislaus’ College upon being expelled in Year 10 at the age of 15. He was subjected to sexual abuse in the form of indecent touching by a priest in charge of his dormitory when he was in Year 9 or 10.51 He has consistently been in employment, at times running his own business, being the takeaway food shop I have referred to earlier. He is described as having a good work ethic.52 He has been married four times. The first marriage broke down when he became depressed over the death of his father with whom he was close. The second and third marriages broke down because of his infidelity. He claimed to Dr Allnutt that he might have a sex addiction. He estimated that he had had about 300 to 400 sexual partners.53 Dr Allnutt’s report includes that the offender became stressed in the period between the offence and his arrest. He claimed to have been relieved when he was finally arrested because he felt “so guilty and bad” and that “it was a weight off (his) shoulders”. He also claimed to have “felt sorry for the victim’s family because he knew they were stressed out”. He told Dr Allnutt that “if I could change it I would a million times over”, “the victim’s family are feeling bad”, “she had some children”, and “they lost their mum”. Later in his report the doctor said that the offender described feeling remorse for the deceased and her family as well as his family.54 The offender has been in protective custody, apparently out of fear of retribution from family or friends of the deceased. He told Dr Allnutt that he had been moved seven times in the past year with the longest he had been in any one gaol being at Parklea for seven months. He claimed to have spent about five to six hours a day outside of his cell, depending upon the gaol. He found being in protection “hard” and he felt uncomfortable with some of his fellow inmates because of the nature of their crimes, for example, paedophilia. Being in protection also meant that he was unable to do any work, although I note that elsewhere in Dr Allnutt’s report it is said that the offender had worked as a sweeper at Parklea early this year.55 He told Dr Allnutt that he thought he might have suffered a stroke when he was at Parklea about six or seven months ago and he described some symptoms. At the conclusion of the interview Dr Allnutt spoke to Justice Health nursing staff and asked them to look into the matter. There was no further evidence on this topic tendered at the sentence hearing.56 There are no issues with drugs, alcohol or gambling. He did have a problem with alcohol between the ages of 17 and 23 but then substantially reduced his intake. 57 He has back problems, with a collapsed vertebrae in his back. He is taking anti-depressant medication. Dr Allnutt said the offender had symptoms suggestive of a mild depressive disorder. There is no suggestion that this was in existence prior to going into custody. Dr Allnutt said that protective custody would probably act as an ongoing stressor.58 The report concludes with recommendations that the offender would benefit from ongoing psychiatric assessment and treatment, psychological counselling, an urgent assessment by a neurologist and a medical examination to rule out a vulnerability to transient strokes, and that he would benefit from neuropsychological testing to examine whether or not his complaints of worsening memory relate to a cognitive impairment. 59 Eleven testimonials from family, friends and work colleagues were tendered. There is one from the offender’s wife in which she expresses continuing support, although there is other evidence to the effect that the relationship is not what it used to be. The others attest to the offender’s various good qualities, describing him as a diligent, hard and skilful worker, reliable, generous with his time and energy, honest, trustworthy, loyal, punctual and respected. There is disbelief expressed at the offender’s actions and expressions of belief that his conduct was out of character. There are also expressions of a perception that he is remorseful. None actually convey what the offender said to support that conclusion and it is apparent that some of the authors have simply assumed that he would be remorseful because of what they otherwise know about his character.60 Ms Susan Bennett, the offender’s sister, gave evidence. She related how she had visited him in a variety of gaols accompanied by her mother and brother who, she said, were also present in court. She gave evidence of an incident that occurred at Bathurst gaol on 18 October last when threats were made to the offender by another inmate. She said that he had already been fearful of retribution from family or friends of Ms Mintern but this incident heightened his fear. She said that he had said that he intended to remain in protective custody.61 Ms Bennett also gave evidence that she thought the offence was “totally out of character”. She said that he had expressed regret and that he was very remorseful and ashamed for what he had done. The Crown Prosecutor pressed her to relate what he had said that supported these conclusions and she experienced some difficulty in articulating an adequate response. Ms Bennett also gave evidence that the offender’s appearance had changed since he went into custody in that he had lost weight and that he did not appear as healthy. I should add that he did not look underweight standing in the dock although it might have been difficult to gauge as he was wearing a suit.Findings as to subjective matters62 There has been much said in the evidence on the topic of remorse by people other than the offender himself. Without having heard from him I have no way of being able to judge whether he is sincere in what he has said. I do not even know exactly what he has said. It was submitted that his confession to police and plea of guilty were indicative of remorse. I rather think that by the time of his arrest the offender realised that the police were closing in on him. He had been aware for some days that they were making inquiries about him and when he heard that the body had been discovered his first instinct was to take flight. He realised the futility of that and was on his way back to Orange when he was arrested. It seems probable that his confession came out of an acceptance of the inevitability that his guilt was known. The same can be said about his plea of guilty. If there was some validity in the submission that was made then it was open to the offender to give evidence and persuade me of it. As it is, I am not satisfied that the requirements of s 21A(3)(i)(ii) have been met in order for me to make a finding of remorse in his favour. I am satisfied that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and that he has regrets and is sorry. I am not satisfied that he has sincerely acknowledge the loss that he has caused.63 I am satisfied that the offender has been, in the main, a person of good character. A qualification to this finding is his criminal history and his admissions of infidelity in his various marriages but aside from those matters he should have the benefit of that finding.64 Another issue to consider is whether he has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. I am not prepared to make those findings in his favour because I do not have a satisfactory explanation for his extremely violent conduct that brought about Ms Mintern’s death. Even if one were to accept his version, there is no adequate explanation for such a violent loss of self control. Dr Allnutt offers no opinion on it. Certainly the offender has not behaved in this fashion before, but I am not in a position to say it could not happen again if he is faced with similar circumstances.65 A submission was made that the offender’s age was a relevant matter to take into account in mitigation of sentence. He is now 49. He will be in his 60’s when is becomes eligible for release on parole. The age of an offender is always a relevant matter to be taken into account but the degree to which it is significant varies from case to case. It cannot be a factor that can produce a sentence that does not appropriately reflect the objective gravity of the offence. I bear in mind that the offender will be in custody for what would otherwise have been the best part of the balance of his working life. However, given that the crime for which he is to be sentenced involved the taking of the life of another human being, it is not a matter of any great significance in all of the circumstances of this case.66 The evidence is incomplete on the topic of the offender being in protective custody. One thing to note is that his experience whilst on remand might not necessarily be the same throughout the time he is to serve his sentence. He has experienced gaols in which he has been allowed out of his cell for five to six hours a day as Dr Allnutt noted, and has had at least one experience of being able to work. Mr Turnbull informed me that at Bathurst gaol he has been confined to his cell for 23 hours a day. His classification has varied from Special Management Area Placements, to Limited Association to Non Association and this has depended upon the gaol he has been in. In some situations he has been kept away from a certain category of inmates but is free to associate with other protected inmates and, at the other extreme, he has been isolated from all other inmates. There is no evidence to enable me to predict what he will experience once he has been classified following sentencing. The best I can do is to factor into my assessment of the sentence the notion that he is likely to experience some limitations over and above those experienced by the general gaol population for a good part, if not the whole, of his sentence.Other sentencing considerations67 I indicated at the outset of these remarks that the offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court. It was submitted on behalf of the offender, and conceded by the Crown, that this warrants a discount on the sentence I impose of 25 percent to reflect the utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system. Whilst to some that might seem to be an inordinate reduction in sentence, it reflects the sentencing law and practice in this State and I see nothing in the circumstances of this case that would justify departure from it.68 I also indicated earlier that a standard non-parole period of 20 years applies to the offence of murder. It is intended for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness where there is a conviction after trial. Here, of course, the offender has pleaded guilty and so I am not going to impose the standard non-parole period. The authorities require, however, that it be kept in mind as a guidepost in the assessment of the appropriate sentence. 69 The offender was on a bond at the time of the offence. Committing an offence whilst in the community under a form of conditional liberty is an aggravating feature that I am required to take into account.70 Of the various purposes of sentencing listed in s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, considerations of general deterrence, denunciation and making the offender accountable for his actions, as well as recognizing the harm that he has caused require particular attention in the assessment of sentence in this case. 71 The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 14 August 2008 and so his sentence should be back-dated to then.Victim impact statement72 Ms Julie Smith, sister of the deceased, bravely read a victim impact statement to the Court. I wish to thank her for sharing with me and everyone else who was present the many ways in which the untimely loss of Ms Mintern’s life has deeply affected a wide circle of family and friends. I acknowledge their grief and loss and I repeat that they have the condolences of myself and the Court. Sentence73 Convicted. 
     
      
      Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 13 years 6 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 4 years 6 months. 
       
       
      The sentence will date from 14 August 2008. The offender will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 13 February 2022. 
       
       
      That is a total sentence of 18 years. Without the plea of guilty the sentence would have been one of 24 years.

      2009/9549 R v Brett Wayne SMITH 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 1 December 2009 I conducted an inquiry pursuant to the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Act"") into whether the accused Brett Wayne Smith is unfit to be tried in respect of two charges pending against him, namely, that on 20 November 2008 at Kempsey he did murder Adam Catt and that on the same day he did wound Janelle Hutman with intent to murder her. On that day I determined that the accused was unfit to be tried for those offences and made orders consequential upon that determination. I indicated that I would deliver my reasons for that decision today. 
     
      
    The Crown case 
     
      
    2 According to the Crown case the accused was born on 5 June 1968.  
     
      
    3 The deceased and his girlfriend Janell Hutman lived at home unit premises in Sea Street, West Kempsey. The accused lived in a unit in the same building. At about 8.45 on the morning of 20 November 2008 the deceased was at home with his sister when her 10-year old son entered the home and said that the accused had just punched him. The deceased and his sister then went to the accused's unit to confront him about what they had been told. The deceased banged on the door and shouted, ""Get out of the house, you bastard. Why would you hit a little kid for [sic]?""  
     
      
    4 This confrontation continued for about a minute, when the accused came to the door. The deceased stepped back from the door as it opened. The accused was standing holding a large black-handled kitchen knife in his right hand, which he raised above his shoulder. The deceased stepped backwards and slipped off the front steps and fell over a small log. The accused advanced towards him making stabbing and slashing motions with the knife. This was seen by the deceased's sister from her front step and by Ms Hutman who was looking through the bedroom window of the unit that she shared with the deceased. 
     
      
    5 The deceased was at this stage bleeding from the face and stomach. The accused turned and ran back inside his unit, and the deceased began walking back to his sister's place. As he reached the top of the front steps he collapsed to the ground. His sister called the police while Ms Hutman placed pressure on the deceased's wounds with her hands. 
     
      
    6 Ms Hutman heard the accused open his front door and looked up to see him pointing the knife at her and say, ""And you"". The accused had the knife in his right hand, raised over his shoulder. Ms Hutman took hold of a small wooden table from the front porch and used it to protect herself as the accused ran at her slashing with the knife. The table was flung from her grasp so she ran towards the carport. She felt a stab wound to the left side of her torso. She continued to run as the accused chased her. She changed direction and was again struck in her back with the knife, which caused her to fall over. The accused stood over her as she said, ""Please Brett don't"". She crossed her arms over her face to protect herself. The accused stabbed downwards towards her with the knife, and she rolled to the side to avoid being struck. The blade of the knife missed her and struck the concrete. The accused walked away. He was heard to say, ""That's what youse get for fuckin' taunting me"". 
     
      
    7 When the police arrived the accused was agitated and semi-coherent. He complained that he was sick of the noise from the children and buses. The police asked the accused where the knife was. He replied, ""I threw it down there,"" indicating the direction of a car in the carport. He was placed under arrest and said, ""Why do they taunt me?"" When the police could not find the knife in the carport the accused was again asked where it was. He said, ""It's broken in the bin inside, why do they taunt me?"" The knife was located in the bin. The blade was bent to an angle of almost ninety degrees at the handle. 
     
      
    8 The cause of death of the deceased was a stab wound to the lower front right hand side of the chest that had penetrated 20cm into the chest cavity cutting the 7th rib and completely severing the inferior vena cava. This resulted in severe bleeding and collapsed lungs. The deceased also sustained non-fatal injuries. 
     
      
    9 Ms Hutman received two stab wounds that required hospital treatment. One stab wound was to her left anterior chest below the breast approximately 2cm in length. The other wound was to the right posterior chest of approximately the same length.The medical evidence 
     
      
    10 The accused was seen by Dr Greg Steele at Silverwater Prison on 16 September 2009. He was assessed for the purpose of providing an opinion as to his fitness to be tried and whether he had available a defence of mental illness. Dr Steele prepared a report dated 19 September 2009. 
     
      
    11 The accused was seen to be a man of Aboriginal descent, single and never married. He was born in the Lismore/Kempsey area of New South Wales and is the second of five siblings. He appears to have had a caring and intact family with a normal upbringing unaffected by physical, sexual or economic deprivation. There was a vague history of psychiatric illness in one of his younger brothers. He had himself been on a Disability Support Pension since the age of about 23. 
     
      
    12 The accused's psychiatric illness became apparent at the age of 21. He was then using marijuana heavily and this had continued to be a complicating feature of his condition. He had a history of several psychiatric admissions. He had been diagnosed as having chronic paranoid schizophrenia that had apparently defied treatment with long acting depo anti-psychotics as well as oral anti-psychotics. His most recent psychiatric admission had been to Kempsey Psychiatric Unit in September 2008, where he ""went for a rest for a couple of weeks"". 
     
      
    13 Following this the accused was treated with Clozapine in view of his treatment resistant schizophrenia. A Community Treatment Order was considered. 
     
      
    14 The accused described himself as being fearful of his neighbours. This was because of ""all the stuff going on"". He referred to demons coming through the walls, which he dealt with by locking himself in what he called ""my little flat"". He believed there were ghosts around and in some way these ghosts and demons were controlled by the next-door neighbours and were trying to take over his body. The messages he got from his three television sets were somehow related to this but he said he would deal with this by ""just changing channels"". 
     
      
    15 Matters subsequently escalated rapidly when, in his words, ""the kids were mucking around"" outside his unit. This resulted in the deceased coming to his door to remonstrate with him about allegations that he struck a child. He denied having done so to Dr Steele. This resulted in the accused believing that he was going to be killed. However, he expressed bewilderment at this saying, ""I don't know what they were trying to kill me for"". In his own defence the accused said when he committed the acts with which he has been charged he ""wasn't right in the head"". 
     
      
    16 The accused presented to Dr Steele with some early signs of tardive dyskinesia apparently related to his longstanding use of anti-psychotic medications. His manner throughout the interview was said to be only marginally appropriate and congruent to a medical examination. Dr Steele said that he never established any rapport with the accused and terminated the interview after 30 minutes. The accused's speech was often quite indistinct and monotonous with few inflections. He was quite unable to describe how he felt about the circumstances he was facing or the situation in which he found himself. Throughout the interview the accused's emotional responses were restricted and blunted and he expressed no real regret or remorse for his actions. 
     
      
    17 The accused was also distracted throughout the interview by auditory hallucinations. He frequently lost the thread of his conversation, making it difficult to either give or receive information. 
     
      
    18 Dr Steele said that the accused was confused and very ambivalent about whether he could instruct a solicitor or avail himself of the defence of mental illness. He continues to manifest symptoms and signs consistent with a diagnosis of treatment resistant chronic paranoid schizophrenia complicated by cannabis abuse and dependence. It was Dr Steele's opinion that the accused satisfied few, if any, of the Presser criteria for fitness to be tried and was not fit to be tried. He was also of the view that the accused would have had available to him a defence of mental illness. He was grossly impaired in his ability to know the nature and quality of his acts or to know that they were morally wrong. 
     
      
    19 The accused was also examined and assessed by Dr Olav Nielssen at the MRRC on 11 June 2009. He recorded observations of the accused that conform to those recorded by Dr Steele. This included the accused's delusional beliefs that he had been the subject of demonic attack by his neighbours immediately prior to the events that gave rise to the charges. 
     
      
    20 In his report dated 12 August 2009 Dr Nielssen expressed the following opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The diagnosis of chronic treatment resistant schizophrenia is based upon [the accused's] account of typical symptoms of schizophrenia and a typical pattern of treatment that included repeated admissions to psychiatric hospital and treatment with long acting injections, and [the accused's] presentation during the recent interview. He was dishevelled in appearance, disorganised in his thinking, appeared distracted as though by hallucinations and expressed a bizarre delusional belief regarding his neighbours. 
         
         
        [The accused's] mental illness was thought to be at least partly treatment resistant as he continued to have acute symptoms of mental illness and to hold bizarre delusional beliefs despite consistent treatment with a moderate dose of antipsychotic medication in a drug free environment since his arrest in November. 
         
         
        From the history provided [the accused] also met the accepted criteria for the diagnosis of cannabis abuse disorder, as it seems likely that his abuse of cannabis contributed to previous exacerbations of mental illness. He also reported consumption of cannabis on the day of the offence, which could have increased the intensity of symptoms and [the accused's] propensity to violence. 
         
         
        At the time of the recent interview there was some doubt about [the accused's] fitness for trial as he reported that he intended to enter a plea of guilty and did not recognise that he had been mentally ill or that his beliefs regarding the victims were delusional. There was also significant impairment in intellectual function associated with treatment resistant mental illness that would affect [the accused's] capacity to follow any proceedings and give reliable instructions based on his understanding of what had taken place in court. However, he is of normal pre-morbid intelligence and should become fit for trial when he receives adequate treatment. 
         
         
        I believe [the accused] probably has the defence of mental illness open to him, as he has a severe schizophrenic illness, which is recognised in law to be a disease of the mind, which gave rise to a defect of reason in the form of grossly disorganised thinking and the delusional belief that the neighbours who he attacked were involved in subjecting him to demonic attacks. His illness prevented him from recognising that his actions were morally wrong, as he believed that he was acting in self defence, or to reason with any sense of composure about the likely consequences of his actions, because of the loss of awareness that he was mentally ill, the acutely fearful state arising from his delusional beliefs and his grossly disorganised and illogical thinking. 
         
         
        [The accused] needs long term rehabilitation in a forensic hospital."" 
        
       
      
    21 Dr Nielssen later re-examined the accused on 8 October 2009 and read Dr Steele's report. In a report dated 28 October 2009 Dr Nielssen expressed the following opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        ""From the findings of the further interview it now seems clear that [the accused] is unfit for trial. He was unable to raise the obvious defence to the charges, that he was not guilty on the grounds of mental illness, because he holds the fixed delusional belief that he was under demonic attack and that he was acting in self-defence. Moreover, he has not responded to treatment in custody and remains distracted by chronic auditory hallucinations that would interfere with his capacity to follow any proceedings in a meaningful way or provide reliable instructions to his legal representatives."" 
        
       
      
    Applicable principles 
     
      
    22 In R v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48 the Court described the following test of unfitness: 
     
      
       
        
        "" … is whether the accused because of mental defect fails to come up to certain minimum standards which he needs to equal before he can be tried without unfairness or injustice to him. He needs . . . to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceedings, namely that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all of the various court formality. He needs to be able to understand. . . the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; he needs to be able to make his defence or answer the charge. Where he has Counsel he needs to be able to do this through his Counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his Counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence but he must . . . have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his Counsel, if any."" 
        
       
      
    23 There is only one standard for assessing whether an accused person is fit to stand trial and that is the Presser test, which sets out the minimum requirement for an accused to stand trial. See also Kesavarajah v The Queen [1994] HCA 41; (1994) 181 CLR 230. The fact that an accused person may have been better able to defend himself or herself had some treatment or medication been available to him or her is not a relevant issue as to fitness to stand trial: R v Rivkin [2004] NSWCCA 7; (2004) 59 NSWLR 284.  
     
      
    24 During the whole proceedings before me the accused remained quietly seated in the dock. He exhibited constant facial contortions. He made no contribution to what occurred, either in the form of any visible reaction or instruction to his counsel. He did not speak and appeared to me at least to be wholly disconnected from the proceedings. Although I had nothing approaching the significant advantage enjoyed by the medical specialists who examined him, my limited observation of the accused confirmed, to the extent possible, the opinions that have been expressed about him.  
     
      
    25 In forming my opinion and making my determination on the question of unfitness, I have had regard to the principles in R v Presser. In the light of the opinions expressed concerning the accused by Dr Steele and Dr Nielssen following their recent examinations of him, I find on the balance of probabilities that he is unfit to be tried for the offences with which he stands charged. 
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    26 In those circumstances, I confirm the orders that I made on 1 December 2009 as follows: 
     
      
      1. I find that the accused Brett Wayne Smith is unfit to be tried for the offence of the murder of Adam Catt on 20 November 2008. 
       
       
      2. I find that the accused Brett Wayne Smith is unfit to be tried for the offence of wounding Janell Hutman with intent to murder her on 20 November 2008. 
       
        
       
       
      3. In accordance with s 14  
      Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 
       1990 
       I refer the accused to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 
       
        
       
       
      4. I remand the accused to his former custody pending the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal under s 16 of the Act or until further order.

The applicant also appealed against the severity of the sentences imposed on him but the argument advanced in the appeal has significantly focussed on the sentence for the abovementioned charge under s113(1). 3 On 8 August, 2008 the applicant was sentenced as follows in the District Court: 
     
      
      1. On a count of commit an act with intent to pervert the course of justice contrary to s319 of the  
      Crimes Act 
       which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and taking into account 4 matters on a Form 1, they being: 
      
     (a) on 1 May, 2005 did impersonate a police officer; (b) on 1 August, 2007 did drive using handheld mobile phone; (c) on 15 August, 2007 did drive whilst disqualified; (d) on 15 August, 2007 did state a false name,  he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 1 year to commence on 30 October, 2007 with a balance of term of 1 year; 
     
      
      2. On a count of malicious wounding under s35(1)(a)  
      Crimes Act 
       which carries a maximum penalty of 7 years, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 30 July, 2008 with a balance of term of 1 year; 
      
     
     
      
      3. On a count of break and enter with intent contrary to s113(1)  
      Crimes Act 
       which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 30 July, 2009 with a balance of term of 2 years. 
      
    The effective sentence was a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months with a balance of term of 2 years, making a total term of 5 years and 9 months.The Facts4 The charge of committing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice related to the driving of a motor vehicle on 15 August, 2007. The applicant was seen speaking on a mobile phone while driving. His car was stopped and the applicant provided a false name to the police. Unfortunately for the applicant, that person was also a disqualified driver and the applicant was arrested and charged under the false name. On 12 September, 2007 he appeared before the Local Court and entered a plea of guilty under the false name and was ordered to perform 200 hours community service and fined. A week later the person whose identity had been assumed went to the police and disclosed that he was not driving a vehicle on the relevant day and he nominated the applicant as the driver. The applicant was then arrested on 30 October, 2007 when he attended to serve his community service order. He was then charged with all offences before this Court.5 The offence of malicious wounding occurred on 1 May, 2005 when the applicant was drinking at the Unity Hall Hotel at Balmain. The applicant attempted to take from the counter two glasses of beer which the victim had purchased. When the victim objected, the applicant said “I am a constable. You must be a senior constable to be talking to me like that.” Subsequently there was an argument between the two men when the victim spoke to the applicant about the attempt to take the beers and the applicant said to the victim “Fuck off, it’s our table” and then said “Fuck off, we’re coppers”. When the victim asked to be shown identification, the applicant grabbed hold of a partly filled schooner beer glass and thrust it into the chin and mouth area of the victim who fell backwards bleeding heavily from the chin. The victim was taken to hospital and he suffered a deep 5cm laceration to the chin which was gaping and bleeding profusely, a 2cm laceration to the upper lip and multiple superficial lacerations to the chin, forehead and lower lip. The applicant absconded from the hotel. His identity was established to the police by hotel staff but efforts to locate him failed until he was ultimately arrested on 30 October, 2007.6 The break and enter with intent charge occurred shortly after 6.30 pm on 19 January, 2006. The agreed statement of facts says: 
     
      
      “… the victims Timothy and Matthew McDonald were at their residence in Lilyfield. The offender arrived at the home affected by alcohol with another male. The offender was asked to leave the premises however an altercation ensued between the offender and Timothy McDonald. 
       
       
      Some twenty minutes later the victims heard a smashing sound coming from the front room and then heard the offender yelling “I’m going to kill you”. The offender was observed to come from the front room wielding a shovel; again saying “I’m going to kill you”. Both victims ran onto the street with the offender pursuing them whilst swinging the shovel. In the attempt to get away, the victim Matthew McDonald fell to the ground receiving injuries which later required treatment.” 
      
     
     
      
      The applicant fled and he was not located by the police. 
      
    The Appeal7 The main focus of the appeal has been on the sentence imposed on the offence of break and enter with intent. The submission is made that the sentencing judge’s factual findings are contrary to the sentencing principles established in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 that a judge in imposing sentence may not have regard to aggravating circumstances if they would render an accused liable to a greater punishment. It is submitted that the judge found the applicant broke into the premises knowing there were people in the premises and committed a serious indictable offence. In consequence he would have been guilty of an offence under s112 of the Crimes Act in circumstances of aggravation as defined in s105A of the Crimes Act and that would have rendered him liable to imprisonment for 20 years. It is also contended that the description of the facts by the sentencing judge would establish an offence under s112 which is not aggravated but which would in any event carry a maximum penalty of 14 years. 8 The judge also said when dealing with the facts of this case: 
     
      
      “The entry of the offender armed with a shovel and the pursuit of the victim with the shovel would have created great fear in the victim. The victim was disturbed in his own home at night and threatened. Clearly the victim was assaulted by the threatening act of the offender wielding the shovel. Whist the threats to the victim were serious I am unable to conclude that the offender intended more than the assault upon the victim by the menacing with the shovel. I cannot be satisfied that he intended to strike the victim with the shovel though it was clearly used as a weapon to gain entry. The victim did however receive some injury in attempting to escape from the offender’s acts of aggression.” 
      
     
     
      
      These remarks refer to an actual assault committed by the applicant. 
      
    9 It is perfectly understandable that the sentencing judge would make these comments because he had before him an agreed statement of facts tendered by the Crown and accepted by the defence which contained this material. It is also clear that his Honour knew he was sentencing for an offence under s113(1) of the Crimes Act which carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment because he specifically said so and there can be no argument open that he mistakenly thought he had open to him a higher maximum penalty than 10 years.10 The argument is advanced that the sentencing judge has taken into account impermissible factors which have led him to impose a significant sentence of 4 years with a 2 year non-parole period. It is argued that the sentence itself indicates that the judge took these other factors into account because not only is it a long sentence but it is partly cumulative on other sentences.11 Because of the remarks made on sentence for more abundant caution it would be preferable now to re-sentence in respect of the break and enter with intent charge and in doing so, to make it plain that no factor other than the facts necessary to establish the charge under s113(1) are being taken into account. The facts relevant are that he broke into a house intending to commit a serious indictable offence, that being an offence of being armed with intent to assault contrary to s114 Crimes Act. That, however, gives rise to the question as to whether or not any of these sentences are manifestly excessive and whether there is any justification for reducing the total sentence or the non-parole period.12 The submission is made that the malicious wounding offence was in 2005 and the break and enter with intent offence was in 2006. On the other hand, the reason the applicant was not dealt with on the malicious wounding charge earlier was because he absconded and it is significant that the break and enter with intent offence was committed while he was still wanted by police for the malicious wounding offence. It is also relevant to consider that in 2003 he was fined on a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The two offences of malicious wounding and break and enter with intent indicate the applicant had at those times a significant problem with his anger management when affected by alcohol.13 The charge of committing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice was also a significant offence of its kind. He was prepared to carry that deception through the charging process, the court process and to the punishment process. Bearing in mind the applicant has a number of convictions for dishonesty and that he has served time in prison, the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge for this offence was entirely appropriate. It is accepted in the submissions of the applicant that the sentencing judge took into account all of the relevant factors in respect of the subjective aspects of the applicant’s case. 14 A particular submission is made that the applicant has changed since the birth of his child and material was tendered before this Court in the form of an affidavit by the applicant indicating he has completed an Alcoholics Anonymous course and that he is applying for classification for day release and from that affidavit it would appear he has settled down well in prison and is regularly visited by his girlfriend and their son. I note, however, he told the Probation Service that he misled the police and the Court about his identity because he did not want to miss the birth of his baby. The Probation Service noted that the baby was born in June, 2007 and the false identification to the police was given in August, 2007. That report also notes that while on remand in prison in January, 2008 he was dealt with for a misconduct charge.15 The three offences are all matters which, in my view, require general deterrence to be reflected and when the total sentence is considered, I believe the sentencing judge assessed the totality of criminality correctly and no less severe sentence is warranted in law: see 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.16 In order to make it plain, however, that no other facts have been taken into account in respect of the break and enter with intent offence other than the facts necessary to establish that charge, I would amend the sentence for that offence.17 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
      1. The appeal against conviction which was abandoned be dismissed. 
      
     
     
      
      2. Leave to appeal against the sentence for the offence of do act with intent to pervert the course of justice be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
      
     
     
      
      3. Leave to appeal against the sentence for malicious wounding be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
      
     
     
      
      4. Leave to appeal against the sentence imposed in respect of the count of break and enter with intent be granted. I would quash the sentence imposed and instead I would sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 12 months to date from 29 July, 2010 and a balance of term of 2 years. I would order his release to parole on 29 July, 2011. The effect of that sentence is the same as the sentence imposed in the District Court, namely a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months with a total term of 5 years and 9 months. 
      
    18 HOWIE J: I agree with Blanch J. In R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; 134 A Crim R 174 this Court stressed the importance of an agreed statement of facts being consistent with the offence for which the offender was to be sentenced. The error in the present case was a direct consequence of the failure of the parties, and in particular the Crown, to ensure that the facts upon which the Judge was asked to sentence the applicant did not breach the De Simoni principle. There was no reason for the purposes of totality for there to be any concurrency between the sentences imposed for the three separate and distinct offences. The applicant still obtains the benefit of partial concurrence between the sentence for the pervert the course of justice charge and the sentence for the malicious wounding charge which was completely unjustified.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, HDR, appeared before me on Monday of this week, having entered pleas of guilty on 4 September 2009 before Howie J to offences of being an accessory after the fact to murder (s 18 & 349 Crimes Act 1900)(count 2), aggravated break, enter and steal (s 112(2) Crimes Act)(count 3), and two of obtaining money by deception (s 178BA Crimes Act)(counts 4 and 5). (Count 1 on the indictment alleges that MR committed the crime of murder).2 These are offences which carry maximum penalties of imprisonment for 25 years, 20 years, and 5 years respectively. The offence of aggravated break, enter and steal also has prescribed for it a standard non-parole period of 5 years.3 In sentencing the offender for the offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder he has asked that I take into account his guilt of an offence of take and drive conveyance (s 154A(1)(a) Crimes Act). In sentencing for the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal he has asked that I take into account his guilt in respect of offences of possessing firearms whilst not licensed and using firearms whilst not licensed (both offences against s 7A(1) Firearms Act 1996), possessing ammunition whilst not licensed (s 65(3) Firearms Act) and not keeping firearms safely (s 39(1)(a) Firearms Act).4 Further, the offender has pleaded guilty to a related summary offence of driving whilst disqualified (s 25A(1)(a) Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998). For this offence the maximum penalty is a fine of 30 penalty units and/or imprisonment for 18 months. There is also an automatic cumulative period of disqualification of 12 months, although a court has a discretion to impose an additional period of disqualification.Facts5 The facts concerning each of the offences have been agreed and are set out in a statement of agreed facts from which I draw the following.6 The late GR lived with his son, the offender, on a 25 acre property near Mudgee. His other son, MR, lived with friends at Mudgee. On Monday 21 April 2008, MR came to stay at his father’s house. The offender was aged 19 and MR was 17.7 On Wednesday 23 April the offender and MR broke into a locked garage at the property where MR lived. A firearms cabinet within the garage was broken into and five firearms specified in count 3 in the indictment were stolen. This was prompted by the offender’s desire to steal a single firearm which he wanted to use to intimidate a person who owed him some money and was “hesitant in paying up”. He subsequently told police that he did not want any ammunition because he only wanted a gun to scare that person. However, MR suggested that they should take all five firearms that were within the cabinet and the offender acquiesced. They also took other items specified in count 3, namely a gun cleaning kit, an ammunition belt, and a large amount of ammunition.8 The guns were taken back to the offender’s home where both young men fired two of them at trees on the property. This gave rise to the Form 1 offence of using firearms whilst not licensed. The firearms where then stored in a shed and later in a cupboard in the offender’s bedroom. Neither the offender nor his brother were licensed to possess firearms or ammunition. Three of the offences on the second Form 1 document relate to the possession of the firearms and ammunition and the fact that the firearms were not stored safely in accordance with the firearms legislation.9 At some stage while they were handling the firearms at the property, MR told the offender, “I’m going to get dad”, or something to the effect that he was going to shoot him. The offender replied, “Don’t be a dickhead”. He dismissed what MR had said because he did not think he was serious. 10 GR arrived home from work that evening at about 9.15pm. There were no issues or arguments. He had his evening meal and retired to bed at about 10.00pm. The offender and MR were in the offender’s bedroom watching television. The offender fell asleep. At some point, MR woke him and repeated the threat he had made earlier in the day but the offender ignored him and went back to sleep. 11 A short time later the offender was roused from sleep by the sound of a gunshot. He went to his father’s bedroom and saw his brother holding a gun and his father on the bed bleeding from the head. He checked for signs of life and found there were none. Either the offender or his brother then placed a towel over their father’s head. 12 The offender told police in an interview the following day that he then returned to bed, hoping that it was all a “dream”. He said he did not contact the police because that would have got his brother into trouble. When he woke the next morning he realised that it was not a dream. 13 The offender now concedes that this was untrue. By signing the statement of agreed facts he has acknowledged that in the immediate aftermath of finding his father dead he took an ATM card from his father’s wallet and went into Mudgee and used it to withdraw $1,000 cash from his father’s account. That was at 11.27pm on 23 April 2008. He made another unsuccessful attempt at 11.29pm. He then waited until just after midnight and tried again and this time, at 12.03am, he was successful in making another $1,000 cash withdrawal.14 In the morning of Thursday 24 April the offender and MR set out in the deceased’s work vehicle. The offender drove. This gave rise to the offence of taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner on the first of the Form 1 documents. MR made a phone call to his mother who lived in Melbourne and told her that he had shot his father. The mother contacted police and officers were despatched to the property. They found the deceased lying on his bed with a gunshot wound to the back of the head. A forensic ballistics expert concluded that the shot was fired at quite close range, perhaps as close as 50 centimetres.15 Police made telephone contact with MR. He admitted that he was responsible for shooting his father and said that he and the offender were in Wollongong. The latter was false. He was asked to go to the nearest police station or provide his exact whereabouts but he refused, stating that he did not want to be caught. Over the following two and a half hours police continued to negotiate with MR. Eventually the pair agreed to go to the Castle Hill police station where they were arrested. 16 Police found in the boot of the car the firearms that had been stolen the day before – a Winchester .222 calibre rifle, a Winchester .22 calibre rifle, a Sportco .22 calibre rifle, a Pietro Beretta .410 shotgun and a Hollis and Sons 12 gauge double barrel shotgun. A large amount of ammunition was also recovered. 17 Each of the young men were interviewed by police. The offender told a number of lies. There was the lie about making the ATM withdrawals in the morning, rather than in the immediate aftermath of the killing. There was also a lie about only telling MR to not tell the police anything, whereas in the course of the phone calls between police and MR the offender could be heard saying that the pair were going up Mount Ousley. They in fact had travelled from Mudgee to Penrith and then through the western and north-western suburbs of Sydney before going to the Castle Hill police station.18 The offender told police that it was his intention to drive to Brisbane or at least up the north coast of New South Wales in order to stall or delay his brother going to gaol. He considered that his brother would not handle the confined spaces of a prison. The money withdrawn from their father’s bank account was shared between them so as to assist in their efforts to evade the detection and apprehension of MR for the murder of his father. They had driven to Penrith Plaza where they stopped and purchased some items, MR some clothes and the offender some video games to help distract him from the thoughts of his father’s death. Subjective features19 The offender was born on 1 October 1988 and so he was aged 19 at the time of the offence and is 21 now.20 He has a criminal record comprising a solitary conviction for, being a provisional driver, driving with the novice range prescribed concentration of alcohol. It was this offence that led to him being disqualified from driving for 6 months from 9 April 2008. That is the only relevance of the criminal record which can otherwise be put to one side.21 The offender did not give evidence in the proceedings before me. A report by Ms Michelle Player, clinical psychologist, was tendered and it is the sole source of information I have about the offender.22 He was born in Wollongong and brought up in Bowral. MR is his only sibling. He described his childhood to Ms Player as “good, carefree, I had nothing to worry about”. There was no history of physical or sexual abuse. His father worked long hours in the mining industry and his mother was the dominant carer for the children. He described her as loving and as someone who was always there if needed. The offender, however, knew that he was loved by his father and he felt particularly close to him.23 The parents separated and then divorced in 1996 when the offender was 8 years of age. This came as a shock to him but he appears to have coped fairly well. He lived with his mother but continued to see his father regularly. His mother formed a new relationship when he was aged 11 or 12. He did not get on with this new partner. Ultimately this led to him being sent to live with his father in Mudgee at the age of 14. He became angry with his mother about this but repressed it and continued to see her, and his brother, every school holidays.24 The offender got along well with his father. He described their relationship to Ms Player as “generally amicable”. MR came to live with them in 2003 and the three appeared to have related well to each other. 25 The mother moved to Melbourne in 2004. The offender saw her three to four times a year but kept in weekly telephone contact. Whilst there had been periods of difficulty between them by reason of her being with a new partner up until 2005, since that time their relationship has been “reasonably good”. I was informed that the offender’s mother was sitting in the back of the court room when I heard the proceedings on sentence last Monday.26 The offender described to Ms Player a relationship with MR that was close, albeit with occasional conflicts during their childhood. 27 The offender was assessed as having average to high average intelligence. He was above average in academic ability at school but found the School Certificate examinations a stressful experience and he withdrew from school at the end of Year 11. Ms Player offered the opinion that he had a fear of failure which accounted for the stress in Year 10 and the withdrawal in Year 11 before embarking upon Higher School Certificate studies.28 The offender has not had any employment. At the time of the offences an application to join the navy was pending. 29 Ms Player’s report includes that the offender was assaulted about 3 months ago by some fellow inmates. He lost consciousness for about 20 minutes. There does not appear to have been any significant injury sustained.30 No problems were reported in relation to drugs, alcohol or gambling. 31 The offender was unable to tell Ms Player anything about the offences or what happened in the days prior to and after his father’s death. He did say, however, that he felt “upset” and “regretful” for his offending behaviour. He also told her that he had not become distressed about his father’s death and that he was “upset that I haven’t been upset”. Ms Player concluded from this that the offender’s grief reaction has been repressed and that he will require specialised psychological assistance.32 The offender appears to be managing satisfactorily in custody. Ms Player’s testing did not indicate that he was overly depressed, anxious or stressed, even following the assault I have referred to earlier. He receives visits from his mother every six to eight weeks and they speak via telephone twice a week. He also corresponds regularly with his brother. He has attempted to undertake a number of vocational and psychological programs but transfers between correctional centres have been an impediment.33 Ms Player’s conclusions include that the offender was prone to anxiety but otherwise of reasonable psychological stability. She felt, however, that it was possible that his frozen grief reaction, indifference to his recent assault in gaol and apparent memory problems now for the offence represent some kind of dissociative-like defence against the awful reality of what has happened. She did not present this as a definitive view but rather one that would need to be explored over several sessions with a psychologist. 34 Ms Player undertook an assessment of the offender’s risk of recidivism and concluded that it is likely to be low. She concluded that his main treatment need is long-term psychological therapy, within the correctional environment if possible but certainly once released into the community. She also offered the opinion that prolonged incarceration may adversely impact upon the offender’s psychosocial functioning, given that he has remained stuck in the grief process for the duration of the eighteen months incarceration to date. She also noted that his youth, lack of aggression or anti-social values would make him something of a target in gaol and that a sentence that allowed him to maximise his time in the community under supervision and to receive appropriate interventions should help in reducing his risk of recidivism.35 I note what Ms Player has said about these issues but there are at least two things that remain unexplained. Why would this young man, not previously disposed to criminal behaviour, even think of obtaining a gun to intimidate a person who owed him a sum of money which, in the scheme of things, was relatively modest? Why would his immediate reaction to the violent death of his father, with whom he had a reasonably close relationship, not be one of abject shock and grief rather than one in which he determined to steal money from his bank account? Ms Player’s report sheds no light on these matters.Objective seriousness of the offences36 There are a number of matters which bear upon the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence of accessory after murder. The offender was aware of earlier threats made by MR. He was immediately aware that MR had shot the deceased and that the deceased was dead. He commenced to give assistance to MR immediately so as to prevent, or at least delay, his apprehension. The assistance he gave was carried out over some fourteen hours. The offender was proactive in providing such assistance in that he drove the car and he provided money for the sustenance of his brother. Not only did the offender transport his brother away from the scene but in the boot of the car were the firearms stolen the previous day, including the one used by MR to kill the deceased. Then there was the contribution of the offender in trying to put the police off their trail by conveying false information over the telephone as to their whereabouts. Regard must also be had to the fact that in the end, both the offender and his brother desisted from their folly and surrendered themselves at the Castle Hill police station. I also have regard to the fact that I accept the offender was motivated by loyalty and emotional attachment to his brother but this is tempered by the fact that the victim of his brother’s crime was his own father.37 The Crown has submitted that this should be assessed as a serious example of assisting a murderer to attempt to escape the consequences of his actions. 38 There is a very wide range of conduct and moral culpability that can be seen in the commission of this type of offence: see Gleeson CJ in R v Farroukh, Court of Criminal Appeal, 29 March 1996, unreported. I assess the facts of this case as placing it slightly below the middle of the range. 39 In relation to the offence of aggravated break and enter the relevant facts include that the premises were a garage as opposed to a residential home. It was necessary for the offenders to not only break into the premises but also to break into the locked firearms cabinet within the premises. MR brought along a pair of bolt cutters for this purpose. There is no information available to me as to the value of the property stolen. It was obviously not substantial but neither was it trivial. The premises were targeted because they were known to contain firearms, one of which was wanted by the offender for the purpose of committing a criminal offence and all of which the offenders were not authorised to possess. A large quantity of ammunition capable of being used in the firearms was also stolen.40 The statutory circumstance of aggravation was that the offence was committed in company. I reject the submission that the gravamen of “in company” as a matter of aggravation lies in the fact that a victim is confronted by force of numbers. That is so in the case of offences like robbery which must be committed in the presence of a victim but an offence against s 112 Crimes Act usually is not. “In company” is one of a number of circumstances of aggravation defined in s 105A. Generally speaking, it is of less gravity than others that are there listed. For example, it is, generally speaking, less serious than if the offender is armed with an offensive weapon, or the offender uses corporal violence upon a person. In the present case the “in company” aspect operates in aggravation because it denotes a greater degree of planning that went into the offence, it enabled the offence to be carried out more speedily, and it enabled the wits of two offenders to be combined to enhance the prospects of the success of the venture.41 The Crown submitted that the objective seriousness of this offence fell in the middle of the range. No submission was made to the contrary. It is a matter for me to make my own assessment. I have concluded that this offence falls close to, but just below, the middle of the range. The main factor I have taken into account is the nature of the items sought to be stolen, and the nature of the items that were in fact stolen. There are dangerous and potentially lethal consequences when unauthorised persons come into possession of firearms and ammunition, as the facts of this case demonstrate, and so the theft of such articles from places where they are lawfully secured should be regarded as a matter of considerable gravity.42 The theft of the $2,000 from the deceased’s bank account in the two ATM transactions before and after midnight was opportunistic as the Crown conceded. It was, however, cold and calculatingly callous. His own father had just been killed in sudden and violent circumstances. The offender’s first reaction was to empty as much as he could from his bank account. By comparison with the gravity of the other offences, however, these matters are relatively minor. They say more about the offender’s personal qualities such as his lack of empathy. Standard non-parole period43 I have mentioned that the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal has a standard non-parole period of 5 years. Standard non-parole periods are intended for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness when an offender has been convicted after a trial. In this case, I have assessed the objective seriousness at just below that point in the range and the offender of course pleaded guilty. They are two reasons why I am not going to impose the standard non-parole period but it retains relevance as a benchmark against which to assess the appropriate sentence. Other reasons are the mitigating features in addition to the plea of guilty that I am about to mention.Mitigating features44 The offender has no significant record of previous convictions. He was of prior good character. I accept that he is unlikely to re-offend and that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. It was not submitted that I should find that the offender is remorseful and that implicit concession was correct, having regard to the requirements of s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.45 The pleas of guilty were entered on 4 September 2009. I was informed that the offender offered to plead guilty to being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter in April of this year but the Crown rejected that offer. I do not know if there was any offer to plead guilty to the other charges. The offender was committed for trial on 18 May 2009. The Crown submitted that the offender is entitled to a discount of no more than 20 percent for the utilitarian value of the plea. Counsel for the offender did not take issue with that submission. Having regard to the fact that the pleas were entered over 16 months after arrest, and over 3 months after committal for trial, I am of the view that a discount in the order of 15 percent is appropriate.Form 1 offences46 In relation to the offences on the Form 1 documents I must bear in mind what was said by the Chief Justice in the relevant guideline judgment. The issue is whether, and if so to what degree, I should give greater weight to considerations of personal deterrence and retribution when sentencing for the primary offences.47 In relation to the offence of accessory after murder I am asked to take into account the offender’s guilt of the offence of taking and driving a conveyance. That offence was really part and parcel of what the offender did in rendering assistance to his brother and so I have concluded that it warrants very little addition to the sentence to be imposed for that offence.48 In relation to the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal the additional offences are the unauthorised possession of the firearms and ammunition, the unauthorised use of a firearm, and failing to safely keep the firearms. It is important not to double count the considerations I have taken into account in assessing the objective gravity of the primary offence. I consider it appropriate to take into account the use of the firearm because that was quite separate and distinct from the primary offence. The other offences, in my view, enhance the overall criminal conduct very little. Putting it another way, the degree to which greater weight should be given to personal deterrence and retribution in sentencing for the primary offence should be only marginal in respect of those three offences. Indeed in respect of the offence of using a firearm, the use was in a relatively minor way – there was what the offender described as “a few test fires” which were directed towards trees on a rural property. I note also that for the primary offence the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years but the Crown Prosecutor informed me that the highest penalty that can be imposed upon summary disposal for any of the offences on this Form 1 document is 2 years. That says something about the relative degrees of seriousness with which the legislature regards these offences.Comparable cases49 Counsel for the offender referred me to three cases which he submitted were comparable in relation to the offence of accessory after the fact to murder.50 R v Dileski [2002] NSWCCA 345 involved an offender who gave assistance to a man who had killed the man’s employer. At the principal offender’s request he attended at the workplace immediately after the murder. He agreed to go to a bank and cash a cheque for $850 drawn on the employer’s account. He returned to the factory and stayed there while the principal offender himself went to a bank and cashed another cheque. While he was away, a friend of the deceased arrived and the offender told him that the deceased had left the premises a half hour before. It was submitted on an appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed, and conceded by the Crown, that the sentencing judge had erred in taking into account the obtaining of money from the deceased’s bank account, and assisting the principal offender to do likewise, as those matters were not things done in order to assist the principal offender evade justice. The only relevant act of the offender was in fobbing off the friend of the deceased so as to prevent or delay the detection of the principal offender’s crime. Hidden J referred to the Judicial Commission sentencing statistics which, at that time, indicated that only 8 out of 18 cases resulted in a full-time custodial sentence. He hypothesised that most of the cases resulting in less than full-time imprisonment would be those in which the offender was motivated by emotional attachment or dependence, or a misguided sense of loyalty. Adopting a starting point of four years, there was a reduction of fifty percent for the offender’s plea of guilty and assistance in giving evidence that resulted in the principal offender being found guilty of murder. A sentence of two years with a non-parole period of one year was imposed. 51 Whilst the offender in that case was not motivated by an “emotional attachment or dependence, or a misguided sense of loyalty”, what he did was significantly less in terms of assistance to the principal offender than in the present case. I also note that the offender in that case had a criminal record, had a drug problem, and was on a bond at the time of the offence.52 R v Yates, Parry, Hyland, Powick [2002] NSWCCA 520 was a case concerning a home invasion/murder. Powick drove the principal offenders to and from the scene. He was sentenced to 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months for the home invasion and a concurrent fixed term of 3 years for being an accessory after the fact to murder. The facts of the case, and the complicating feature of the sentence for the accessory offence being subsumed under the sentence for the home invasion offence render it of no assistance in the determination of the appropriate sentence in the present case.53 R v Strahan [2003] NSWCCA 397 was also suggested to be a comparable case but I note that it involves the offence of being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter, an offence which carries a maximum penalty that is one fifth of the maximum penalty for accessory after the fact to murder. It provides no assistance. 54 There were three other cases set out in a table of so-called comparable cases provided by counsel for the offender. I do not find any of them sufficiently similar to the present case such that they provide any assistance. The six cases referred to certainly do not establish any tariff or range of sentencing for this type of offence.55 The Judicial Commission sentencing statistics also do not provide any real assistance as the database is presently comprised of only 13 cases. I note that in contrast to the statistics referred to in Dileski, only 2 out of the 13 cases involved sentences other than full-time imprisonment.Concurrence or accumulation56 It was conceded by counsel for the offender that there should be a degree of partial accumulation of the sentence imposed for count 2 (accessory after murder) upon the sentence imposed for count 3 (the offence against s 112(2)) but it was also submitted that the degree should be relatively modest. He also submitted that the offences in counts 4 and 5 (obtaining money by deception) should be concurrent between themselves and entirely subsumed within the sentence imposed for count 2.57 The Crown agreed that the sentence for count 2 should be accumulated upon the sentence for count 3 and conceded that there could be a substantial degree of concurrency between the sentences for counts 4 and 5 and the sentence for count 2.58 I accept that there should be a degree of partial accumulation of the sentences for counts 2 and 3. They are quite separate and distinct offences. The commission of one was only coincidentally related to the other, albeit they were separated by only a relatively short period of time. The extent of the partial accumulation must be constrained by the totality principle.59 Neither counsel made submissions as to the sentence to be imposed for the offence of driving whilst disqualified. Having regard to the offender’s very limited prior record, in my view there should be a sentence of imprisonment because there is really no viable alternative, but it should be short and ordered to be served concurrently with the sentence for count 2.Other sentence considerations60 Of the purposes of sentencing listed in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, general deterrence is particularly important in sentencing for those who assist a murderer to evade justice and for those who break in to premises in order to steal a firearm to use in the commission of a criminal offence.61 The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 24 April 2008 and so the first sentence will be back-dated to that date.62 I am going to impose sentences of imprisonment for the offences in counts 4 and 5 and for the offence of driving whilst disqualified that are of 6 months or less and so I am required to state my reasons for doing so. The reason is that there is no other sentencing option that would have any utility.63 Counsel for the offender has submitted that there are special circumstances for reducing the proportion of the sentence to be represented by the non-parole period. I take this to relate to the overall sentence and non-parole period. There are a number of features that are relevant. The offender is a young man with virtually no previous involvement with the criminal law. This is his first experience of gaol and he will likely go to live in a different community upon release. He will need a significant period of post release supervision to assist him to reintegrate and he will need assistance in relation to the psychological issues discussed in the report of Ms Player. For these reasons a longer than usual period of post release supervision is called for. The fact that there will be a partial accumulation of sentences is another reason for making an adjustment.Sentence64 On each: Convicted.

      JUDGMENT 
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Rachel Pfitzner, the offender, has pleaded guilty to the murder of her two year old son, Dean Shillingsworth.2 I note that the child’s name has been published in the media. I can only assume that this is because a “senior available next of kin” has consented to such publication: s 11(4)(d) Children’s (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. The section otherwise prohibits the publication of anything that would identify the deceased’s siblings. In the published version of this judgment they will be identified by initials. Events leading to Dean’s death3 The offender was born in 1981. In August 2000 she had a daughter, T. In 2002, at the age of 21, she commenced a relationship with Paul Shillingsworth. The relationship appears to have been a stormy one. It was attended by arguments, alcohol and drug abuse and domestic violence. Dean was born on 25 February 2005. 4 In February 2006, T complained about something that a Mr Michael Campbell had done. The offender and Mr Shillingsworth responded by seriously assaulting him. They were charged by the police and remanded in custody. Officers of the Department of Community Services took Dean and T to live with Ms Ann Coffey, the mother of Paul Shillingsworth, whilst the couple were in custody. Mr Shillingsworth remained in custody and that appears to have marked the end of the relationship. The offender was released after 2 days and came and took the children back. She then lived with them in a refuge in Armidale. Thereafter there was an informal arrangement whereby Ms Coffey cared for Dean for a few days at a time. At some point in early 2006 the offender is said to have told Ms Coffey’s partner, Edmund Caban, “I will kill Dean before he goes back with Ann”. Notwithstanding this, Ms Coffey still cared for Dean on subsequent occasions and had custody of him on a full-time basis through the latter part of 2006 and in to 2007.5 The offender commenced a relationship with Mr Clifford Connors around the middle of 2006 although they were not living together. They had a son, B, born in April 2007. At the end of that month the offender moved in to her own house at Rosemeadow. Mr Connors came to live with them a short time later.6 In March 2007 the offender commenced court proceedings to regain custody of Dean. Ms Coffey opposed this. It was her son’s wish that she have custody and be appointed Dean’s guardian. However the offender told her Family Support Service caseworker (“the caseworker”) that she loved Dean, wanted him back and wanted him to get to know his brother and sister. After a conference with lawyers at the end of May she told the caseworker that she was happy and excited about the prospect of soon being able to have access to Dean. Consent interim orders were made on 4 June 2007 with Ms Coffey having custody and the offender having defined access periods. Again, the offender told the caseworker that she was happy about the prospect of having access. 7 The offender had the care of Dean on the weekend of 9-10 June 2007 and returned him to Ms Coffey at the appointed time. She told the caseworker that it had been a happy occasion, like a big reunion, and that they put on a party for Dean. On 7 July 2007, the next scheduled occasion of access, Ms Coffey delivered Dean to the offender. She was supposed to return him to Ms Coffey at 6.00pm that evening but did not. On 24 July 2007 Ms Coffey commenced proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court for a recovery order which would empower the police to take Dean from the offender and return him to Ms Coffey. The application was listed for hearing on 28 September.8 Initially the offender was pleased to have Dean with her. She told the case worker on 16 July 2007 that she had not returned Dean after the last access visit because she “felt emotionally attached to him”. On 19 July the case worker observed that Dean appeared well and was reacting well with the offender. On 1 August she observed that the offender was still happy that Dean was with her. He was dressed appropriately, was tidy and well behaved. 9 The situation deteriorated. The offender’s parenting in relation to T and B was appropriate but her behaviour towards Dean was quite different. She became resentful of his presence and was critical of his behaviour. She began to think that Dean had been spoiled by his grandparents and was acting out. She told her case worker that she would “get that out of him”. She told various people that Dean’s behaviour was unreasonably wilful and disobedient. She punished him severely and frequently. She said to one of the neighbours that he was a “little bastard”. To another neighbour she described him as “an asshole”. She sometimes banished him from the house, forcing him to stay outside in the cold. Dean was often hungry and would forage for food but she punished him for doing so. He was not completely toilet trained but the offender blamed him for that. She said she was sick of cleaning up after him and expected him to clean up any mess that he made. Dean would seek the offender’s affection but this would cause her to become angry as she thought he was being overly clingy. 10 The relationship between the offender and Dean became worse as time went on. She told people that he reminded her of his father whom she loathed and feared. Understandably, Dean turned to Mr Connors for affection and this was reciprocated. The offender, however, took exception. She told a friend, Ms Twila Daley, that “he [that is, Dean] is ruining our life”. 11 No-one saw the offender punish Dean with anything more than a slap but Mr Connors, the offender’s mother, Mrs Beverley Pfitzner, and Ms Daley all observed bruises on his body. Mrs Pfitzner observed this with worsening frequency in the July – October 2007 period. The offender was to later claim to her mother that this was from Dean picking at sores, although she did acknowledge that she slapped him.12 Mrs Pfitzner described Dean as “looking great” and “a real happy kid” when he returned from being with Ms Coffey but described him as a “nervous wreck” when he was with the offender. Mr Connors described Dean as being terrified of his mother. He said that the offender would hit Dean about three times each day for doing things like wetting himself and eating leftover food. Mr Connors perceived the mistreatment of Dean as being so bad that he considered contacting the Department of Community Services. Ms Daley described Dean as being “so scared of her when she was around that it was not usual”. The offender complained to Ms Daley that Dean was “getting worse; he won’t listen to me. He gets up at night looking for food and he won’t go in the toilet”. She also said that she did not look at Dean like he was her son. Neighbours described Dean being locked out of the house and hitting the doors whilst crying and trying to get back inside. He was repeatedly heard to cry out, Mummy, mummy, I am sorry”. 13 On 24 September, four days before Ms Coffey’s application was listed for hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court, the offender contacted her solicitors and told them that she would comply with any recovery order made by the court. She also withdrew her instructions from those solicitors. She was later to tell the police that this was after she had been told that Paul Shillingsworth had said that when he found her he was going to kill her. She heard this around early to mid September. 14 On 28 September 2007 the application for the recovery order was stood over to 11 October. Between those two dates the offender contacted the Federal Magistrates Court on a number of occasions to advise that she did not want to go back to court and asked when someone would come to collect Dean.15 On 25 September 2007 the offender told her case worker that she wanted to give Dean back to his grandparents because she was not coping. On 3 October she told her that she did not want to go to court and just wanted her son picked up by the police and taken back to the grandparents. She said that she could not stand Dean because he reminded her of his father and wanted him gone as soon as possible. The caseworker included in her contemporaneous notes, “the sooner the better”, because she felt that something was not quite right about the way she saw Dean being treated. The case worker asked if she felt that she may harm Dean in anyway but the offender assured her that she would not. They discussed making contact with the lawyers acting for the grandparents and making arrangements to return Dean to them. The case worker offered to act as an intermediary by taking Dean herself to meet the grandparents when they came to Sydney to collect him. The offender said she would discuss it with her mother before making a decision. 
     
      
    16 Mrs Pfitzner’s evidence includes that around this time in a telephone conversation with the offender she said, “If worse comes to worse, I’ll take him, he is a good little boy”. The offender did not take up the offer.17 A recovery order was made ex parte in the Federal Magistrates Court on 11 October 2007. That morning the offender walked to the home of Ms Daley with Dean and B. Prior to arriving at Ms Daley’s house the offender warned Dean not to eat anything whilst they were there. The offender used Ms Daley’s house phone to call the court to inquire whether the recovery order had been made. She was not given any information because of a court policy about giving information over the phone. Ms Daley’s brother and her partner brought home some food from McDonalds. It became apparent that Dean was hungry and one of the men gave him a hamburger. The offender came into the room and saw Dean eating and became enraged. She took the food from him and promptly took Dean and B home. Ms Daley observed on this day that Dean had bruises over his face and scratches and bruises on his arms. 18 The offender murdered Dean soon after they arrived home. He died from asphyxiation. She wrapped his body in plastic bags, placed it in a suitcase and then threw it into a duck pond near her home. 19 At about midday the offender returned to Ms Daley’s home with T and B. She was crying and told Ms Daley, “I had to do it Twilar, I had to do it”. She explained that she had taken Dean to the Campbelltown office of the Department of Community Services and left him there with a note attached. 20 Mr Connors saw that the offender was crying when he arrived home at about 4.00pm. She gave him the same explanation for Dean’s absence as she had given Ms Daley. She told a number of other people the same story in the ensuing days. However, she spoke to her case worker on 15 October and told her that everything was going well, Dean had been good and that she was not as stressed and was managing alright. 21 On 17 October 2007 a group of school children discovered the suitcase floating in the pond. 22 In the early part of the police investigation there were difficulties in identifying the child. It was thought that it was a boy of four to seven years of age. Dean, of course, was aged 2 years 8 months.23 Police attended the offender’s home on three occasions in the afternoon and evening of 18 October 2007 to execute the recovery order that had been made in the Federal Magistrates Court the week before. The offender persisted with her story of having dropped Dean off at the Department of Community Services office at Campbelltown. The house was searched but nothing of interest was found.24 Police interviewed Mr Connors in the early hours of 19 October. They had made inquiries and had discovered that Dean was not in the care of the Department of Community Services and they were concerned to locate him as a matter of urgency. Mr Connors told the officers that when Dean first came to live with the family in July it was all good but he came to notice that the offender was not relating well with him and was mistreating him. He said she treated T and B well but not Dean who came to be terrified of her. He inquired of her a few times what the problem was. He even asked whether Dean was “too black” for her. Mr Connors was unable to assist the police as to Dean’s whereabouts because all he knew was what the offender had said about having taken him to the Department of Community Services office.The cause of death25 The only evidence concerning what the offender did to kill Dean is that of the forensic pathologist who conducted the post mortem examination of his body and what the offender has said on the topic herself.26 The forensic pathologist, Dr Dianne Little, was unable to make a definitive finding as to the cause of death. She concluded, however: 
     
      
       
        
        The pattern of bruising on the face in addition to the laceration of the mucosal surface of the upper lip would be consistent with the type of injuries sustained in suffocation, possibly due to placement of hand/s over the face. 
        
       
      
    27 The offender was spoken to by police after her arrest on 20 October 2007. She claimed that Dean’s death had been “an accident”. She said:  
     
      
       
        
        I shook him. He stopped breathing and I tried resuscitation. I put him in the bag and the suitcase. I just kept seeing his father and couldn’t stop myself. I could see myself doing it, but I didn’t think it was me. I tried to love him. I’ve got to live with this for the rest of my life, but the media are portraying it as if it is real evil, but I am going to get punished in my own way.  
        
       
      
    28 She agreed to be formally interviewed. In that interview she said that after returning from Ms Daley’s home she had bad memories coming into her head. All she could see when she looked at Dean was his father. Something came over her and she lost control. She picked Dean up by his jumper and commenced shaking him from side to side. She demonstrated to the interviewing officers a one handed grip in front of the throat. She said that Dean was wearing a thick hooded jumper and jeans. She said that as she was shaking him she thought that he “went into his jumper” and was making a gurgling sound. She shook him for about two minutes and then stopped. She walked a short distance away to collect her thoughts. She said that something then “rushed over me again” and she came back to Dean and commenced shaking him again in the same way. He wet himself as he was gasping for air. She said the two episodes of shaking went for “a few minutes to five minutes”. She could not recall how much force she used during the shaking but said, “I must have done enough for what happened”. After the second episode she threw or pushed Dean to the ground and he fell on the back of his head and started gurgling. She realised what she had done and performed CPR for about ten minutes. She then put her hand on his heart and felt that it was going “real fast and then it just all, it just stopped ‘cause he had all the froth coming from his mouth”. She realised that he had died. She said that at no stage had she covered Dean’s mouth with anything. 29 The offender said that she undressed Dean because he was wet from having urinated. She took his body upstairs and placed it in a plastic bag before placing it in a suitcase. She put the suitcase in a pram, covered it with a blanket and took it to the duck pond and threw it in. She waited for it to sink before walking home. 30 The offender was charged with Dean’s murder and remained in custody. 31 The following day, 21 October 2007, the offender telephoned her mother from gaol. Her mother asked her what she had done to Dean and she said, “I strangled him”. Her mother asked her why she had told the police that she shook him but she did not reply. 32 Eleven days later police covertly recorded a conversation between the offender and her mother in the visiting area at the Silverwater Women’s Correctional Centre. In the course of that conversation the offender said: 
     
      
       
        
        I picked him up by his little jumper, I was pulling him, and I pushed him to the ground and like, he was frothing from the, from the mouth ... and then ... his heart, and it stopped, it stopped. 
        
       
      
    33 Her mother asked if she had been in a rage when she did it and she replied, “I just felt intimidated”. She was asked whether she had told the police that she had suffocated Dean and she said, “He never got suffocated … It wasn’t suffocating, I choked him”. She was asked how and she replied, “It must have been the jumper, ‘cause he had the hood on it”.34 She also explained to her mother that she had implored the Federal Magistrates Court to process the recovery order and to come and collect Dean. She said that she had decided against surrendering Dean to the Department of Community Services because that might result in her other children being taken from her. 35 The offender told Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist engaged by her solicitors: 
     
      
       
        
        I told him to go out and play ... he wouldn’t listen ... then I lost it ... I grabbed him by the shirt and jumper which had a hood and shook him ... the next thing I remember was that he was frothing at the mouth ... I panicked and tried to do resuscitation on him ... I was in a state of shock. 
        
       
      
    36 She said that she could not remember strangling him or suffocating him. 37 She subsequently told Dr Yvonne Skinner, a psychiatrist who had been engaged by the Crown, that she was, “very frustrated by Dean’s behaviour because he was ‘clinging’ to her and would not go outside to play”. However she claimed to not have a clear recollection of the events that led to his death and could not explain how he died. She said she disposed of the body out of panic. When she realised what she had done she became shocked, scared and petrified. 38 Dr Little, the forensic pathologist, was asked about the offender’s claim to have shaken the child. She said that Dean’s death was not, in her opinion, a result of having been shaken. However she was cross-examined at the committal proceedings in the Local Court. She was taken to two injuries seen on the child’s cheek which she had regarded as supporting the proposition that the child had been suffocated. She conceded that she could not say how old those injuries were and that it is possible that they could have been sustained in the attempt to resuscitate the child as the offender had claimed. Although Dr Little maintained that the child was unlikely to have died from having been shaken, she did not contend that this was not in fact the case. A proposition was put to her that Dean had been shaken and at the same time the two sides of the hood of his jumper were pulled together in the vicinity of his neck under the chin and that this may have, in lay terms, choked him. She agreed that it was possible that the death may have been caused by, or substantially contributed to, compression of the neck in the course of these actions.  
     
      
    39 The offender’s account given recently to Ms Anna Robilliard, forensic psychologist, was that she was annoyed and irritated by Dean’s presence and told him to go away and play. She said that “he just stood there and he wouldn’t go”. She said she then picked him up by his jumper and proceeded to shake him from side to side. She said she stopped briefly and then repeated her actions. She claimed to Ms Robilliard, “it all happened so quick”. She also told Ms Robilliard that she did not intend to kill Dean.40 Precision as to the mechanism of death is impossible with this material. All that can be said is that Dean died of asphyxiation as a result of the actions of the offender. I will say something more about what she intended later in these reasons. Victim Impact Statements41 Victim impact statements were made by Mr Paul Shillingsworth and Ms Anne Coffey. Clearly the loss of Dean has been a most painful experience for them and one that will be an emotional burden upon them for the rest of their lives. I reiterate what I said at the sentence hearing, that they, and all of Dean’s family and friends, have the condolences of the Court and myself.Subjective features42 The offender was born in August 1981 and so she was aged 26 at the time of the offence.43 She has a criminal history. Her record includes convictions for assaulting and resisting a police officer, damaging property, and making a false accusation with intent to subject another person to an investigation in 2005. For each of those matters she was placed on a 12 month bond. In July 2006 she was ordered to perform community service for a shoplifting offence. On 6 October 2006 she was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months with a non-parole period of 6 months for the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm in company. This related to the incident in which she and Paul Shillingsworth had assaulted Mr Campbell in February 2006. Execution of the sentence was suspended upon the offender entering into a bond to be of good behaviour. The judge took into account that she had been in custody on remand for two days following her arrest and for almost six weeks between a breach of her bail conditions and being sentenced. She was subject to that bond when she killed Dean and that is an aggravating factor I must take into account. The record also includes offences such as assaulting and resisting police officers and receiving stolen property which were dealt with in the Children’s Court.44 The suspended sentence bond was revoked on 19 November 2009 at the Sydney District Court, the breach of the bond being the commission of the crime for which the offender presently stands for sentence. The sentence of 18 months with a non-parole period of 6 months was activated. It was specified to date from 20 October 2007, the date of the offender’s arrest for the instant offence, with the non-parole period expiring on 19 April 2008.45 Although the Crown has submitted that the offender’s prior record is one of a number of “aggravating factors”, it has not submitted that I should regard it as demonstrating in the offender a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law. The submission was that it disentitles the offender to leniency. I accept that concession as correctly made.46 Most of the information I have concerning the offender’s background is to be found in reports by psychologists and psychiatrists. The offender did not give evidence. I have reports by Ms Robilliard (4 October 2006 and 4 December 2009), Dr Nielssen (12 May 2009), Dr Skinner (20 July 2009) and Dr Wayne Reid (10 September 2009). It is somewhat difficult to get a clear picture of the offender’s life as there are inconsistencies in the history she gave to each of the report writers. I largely attribute this to the fact that third parties are relating a long story with varying degrees of detail and it is impossible to determine how accurately the story was told to them and how accurately they have recorded it. This is just one of the problems when an offender does not give evidence in sentence proceedings but relies upon what has been reportedly said to others.47 The offender was born in Blacktown and she was the eldest of seven children. She grew up in Mt Druitt. Her father worked while her mother operated a small day care centre as well as being the homemaker. She has claimed that her father abused both alcohol and drugs. Her parents’ relationship was marked by frequent arguments and she claims that her father was violent towards herself. She felt that her siblings were given more attention than she was and that she was not really supported.48 Her education was limited. She failed the School Certificate. She claimed that she felt frustrated because she did not understand what was going on in classes and could not concentrate. She fell asleep in class. She felt that her teachers were too hard on her. She would go home, lose her temper and smash up her room. In Year 5 she stabbed a girl with a pencil resulting in serious injury.49 She experienced petit mal seizures when she was a small child but could recall little detail about medication or treatment that was prescribed. She recalled that a doctor said she would grow out of it.50 Her parents separated when she was 17 and she claims that she was blamed for the break-up. She left school and home at that age and lived in various youth refuges. She fell pregnant the following year and gave birth to T in August 2000. The father was a man by the name of Faron Blair who she had met in Inverell when visiting friends. Their brief relationship ended when he became aware of the pregnancy. 51 The offender then found accommodation with a woman in Tamworth. That was Ms Anne Coffey. Her son, Paul Shillingsworth, was in gaol at the time but she met him through his mother and they commenced a relationship when he was released in 2004. Their relationship was volatile. She told Ms Robilliard that he was schizophrenic and became violent when affected by alcohol. She told Ms Robilliard in 2006 that she could handle him and that she saw a future in the relationship, notwithstanding he was in custody on remand at that time.52 She has used cannabis off and on since the age of 17. She sniffed solvents for about a year when she was a teenager. She has occasionally used heroin and amphetamine but not to the point of addiction. She has also abused alcohol at times, particularly during her late teens and in the time of her relationship with Mr Shillingsworth. Whilst in custody she has completed a drug and alcohol course for which she received a certificate. 53 Ms Robilliard concluded in 2006 that the offender had an “entrenched paranoid personality disorder and a highly defended and defensive character”. She added that the offender “would be hypervigilant, constantly anticipating negative treatment and negative consequences”. Ms Robilliard’s first report was written for the purpose of the offender’s sentencing hearing in October 2006. One of the needs she identified in the context of future rehabilitation was for the offender to engage in anger management courses.54 As a measure of the degree of family support that the offender has, there have been occasional visits to her in gaol by various family members. However it has been reported that she has not seen her mother this year and, although her father does not visit he does maintain regular contact. T and B are with the same foster carer and officers of the Department of Community Services have arranged for them to be brought together to the gaol for visits. 55 The offender is studying for her Higher School Certificate through TAFE but her progress has been very slow because she has a short attention span and her reading and comprehension is slow. The course is a part-time one over a four-year period. 56 She has been in regular contact with the mental health service in custody and has seen a psychologist and a psychiatrist at regular intervals. She is receiving treatment with mood stabiliser and antidepressant medications. She described to Dr Nielssen longstanding symptoms of depression. 
     
      
    Psychiatric and psychological assessments57 Dr Nielssen made diagnoses of Substance abuse disorder and Depression. The latter diagnosis was made on the basis of the offender’s account of longstanding symptoms as well as on the basis of her presentation at the second of two interviews. Dr Nielssen saw other features independent of the history given by the offender that supported the diagnosis. 58 Dr Reid, a clinical neuropsychologist was given a history of her formative years, her education, drug and alcohol use and relationships that is broadly consistent with that which she gave to the other report writers. Dr Reid administered a number of psychometric tests and the like. They indicated intellectual impairment in a variety of respects including in her memory and ability to reason. Dr Reid concluded as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The detailed analysis of her responses on the Personality Questionnaire appear to reflect accurately the history that she reports and that which has previously been documented where she has ongoing problems with distrust, impulsivity, anxiety, unusual ideas and beliefs, feelings of helplessness, suspiciousness, alcohol abuse, hostility and bitterness, a history of anti-social behaviour, poor control over her anger, depression, drug abuse and sensation seeking behaviour and impaired empathy. 
         
         
        The Personality Assessment also highlights characteristics such as her being easily angered, having difficulties controlling expression of her anger and having little control over her behaviour once she is angered. Her aggressive behaviour may be further exacerbated by features such as psychotic symptoms, agitation and there are also indications that she had recurrent thoughts related to suicide and self harm must be viewed as a suicide risk (sic).  
         
         
        ... 
         
         
        Overall from my assessment of Ms Pfitzner she clearly shows impairment in her intellectual and cognitive functioning which appears most likely due to her current mental state. It is recommended she have a further assessment by a neurologist and that her treating psychiatrist be consulted with regard to her psychiatric diagnosis as the above diagnoses only represent those arising from her reported symptoms. It is also recommended that she undergo an intensive psychological management program aimed at reducing her impulsive behaviour, anger management and risk of self harm. 
        
       
      
    59 In contrast to the history of long standing symptoms of depression given to Dr Nielssen, when the offender was asked by Dr Skinner whether she had suffered from depression she is reported to have said that she felt depressed as a child but said nothing of being depressed since that time until she came into custody in October 2007. She told Dr Skinner that her mood was “up and down”, that it was a “vicious cycle” and that she feels depressed and “lashes out” and then is in trouble with prison staff. Dr Skinner reported that the offender had been involved in two fights in two days and had been charged with internal disciplinary offences. She was subject to a formal requirement that she was not to intimidate, assault or harass other inmates. She told Dr Skinner that she has no control over her aggression. She did not know how to handle her aggressive impulses. Dr Skinner asked how she behaved and whether she shouted and she replied, “I don’t shout, I punch”. By way of example, on the second occasion Dr Skinner attended upon her she had swelling on her right hand and explained that she had punched a wall after a telephone conversation with her mother. 60 Dr Skinner did something that it appears none of the other report writers had the opportunity of doing and that is to view a DVD recording of the police attempting to execute the recovery order on 18 October 2007. She observed that in speaking with the police officers the offender showed no signs of depression or anxiety, mental illness or mood disorder, and at no point appeared emotionally distressed or detached. 61 Dr Skinner made diagnoses of “Substance abuse (presently in remission) and Borderline personality disorder”. She described persons with borderline personality disorder as having: 
     
      
       
        
        (A)n unstable self-image, a pattern of unstable intense interpersonal relationships and marked impulsivity. They have difficulty with anger management and often engage in self-harming behaviour. They fear abandonment and often experience periods of anger, panic or despair. 
        
       
      
    62 Dr Skinner expressed this opinion about the offender: 
     
      
       
        
        I consider that Ms Pfitzner has a diagnosis of severe personality disorder such that she could not cope with the management of her children and stresses of daily life. She had engaged in self-harming behaviours since early adolescence, resulting in delayed maturation of personality and difficulty in coping with the demands of her children. She lacked an understanding of childhood development and had unrealistic expectations of Dean’s behaviour. 
        
       
      
    63 She described “important factors” leading to the offence as including: 
     
      
       
        
         Alleged threats by Paul (Shillingsworth), causing fear and distress for Ms Pfitzner 
        
       
       
        
         Heavy use of marijuana in the period leading to the death of Dean, followed by a period of several days’ abstinence with agitation and irritability 
        
       
       
        
         The absence of her partner on his first or second day of a work project leaving Ms Pfitzner feeling abandoned and lonely, as he had usually been at home to assist her 
        
       
       
        
         Ms Pfitzner felt that she was not coping with managing Dean’s behaviour, and was ambivalent about whether to return him to the care of his grandmother 
        
       
       
        
         On the day of the (offence), she was irritated by Dean’s constant need to be with her, and refusal to go outside to play. 
        
       
      
    64 Dr Skinner disagreed with the diagnosis of depression made by Dr Nielssen. She accepted that the offender experienced moods of depression but believed that these were of varying duration and intensity and probably occurred as she reacted to events. She preferred to explain the offender’s description of events leading to the death of Dean, her actions causing his death and her subsequent feelings of panic as being consistent with the reactions of a person with a borderline personality disorder. She did not consider that the killing of Dean could be accounted for by substance abuse or depression, although she allowed for the possibility that abstinence from marijuana in the days before might have been a contributing factor.65 Dr Skinner concluded her report with a note of pessimism: 
     
      
       
        
        Personality disorder does not respond well to psychiatric treatment. Some improvement would be expected over time with increasing age. Some persons respond to psychotherapy over years with support and patience on the part of the therapist, but the person is likely to suffer relapses with mood swings and self-harming behaviour. 
        
       
      
    66 It was only this morning that I received the second of the reports by Ms Robilliard and she was called for cross-examination by the Crown. The Crown took issue with the validity of psychometric testing conducted recently by Ms Robilliard and with her qualifications to express some of the opinions in her report. I am not overly concerned about this because the testing by Ms Robilliard largely tended to confirm the opinion expressed by Dr Skinner that the offender has a “severe personality disorder”. Compared to her testing in 2006, Ms Robilliard found there to be “significant increases on the levels previously achieved on the Antisocial and Sadistic/Aggressive scales”. Her recent report includes: 
     
      
       
        
        In summary Rachael’s current profile described a profoundly disturbed personality construct and profoundly negative feelings of self worth, beyond that measured on testing in 2006. … On the clinical scales she demonstrated symptoms of severe personality disorder with a particular elevation on the Paranoid scale. Where this occurs along with significant elevations on the Delusional Disorder scale, as in this case, the possibility of paranoid thinking at a delusional level needs to be considered. Such individuals are likely to become periodically belligerent, voicing irrational but interconnecting delusions of a jealous, persecutory or grandiose nature. Their moods are likely to be hostile and they may feel picked on and mistreated. Elevations on the Antisocial and Aggressive scales would be demonstrated in under controlled aggressive behaviour and generalised hostility. Impulsive acting out, insensitivity and ruthlessness would be employed as mechanisms for avoiding abuse or victimization. 
        
       
      
    67 Ms Robilliard’s report concludes with a note only slightly less pessimistic to that of Dr Skinner: 
     
      
       
        
        While personality disorders are well recognised to be difficult to treat, psychotherapy aimed at assisting the individual to exercise strategies for directing and increasing behavioural control can have benefits. Increasing age and maturity is also know to moderate the more overt aspects of antisocial personality in particular. 
        
       
      
    What caused the offender to do what she did?68 The offender gave an account to Dr Nielssen of having been in “a state of depression” at the time of Dean’s death. She claimed to have been “very fearful of Paul (Shillingsworth)” and also felt “very frustrated and angry with myself”. She said that when Mr Shillingsworth was imprisoned in 2006 she decided to end the relationship. She cut off contact with Mr Shillingsworth and his family, notwithstanding her son was then in the care of Ms Coffey. She said that a threat by Mr Shillingsworth to kill her when he got out of gaol was communicated to her daughter’s aunt. She understood that he was due for release in August 2007 and she claimed that in the period leading up to Dean’s death she lived in fear that he would find out where she lived. This may, at least in part, explain why she gave up contesting the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court.69 The offender told Dr Nielssen that Dean was “sometimes difficult because he wouldn’t listen” and that she smacked him on occasions. Dr Nielssen asked if she ever associated Dean with his father and she is reported to have replied, “I never thought about it”. She was asked if she thought there was an association between her fear of Paul Shillingsworth and her behaviour towards Dean and she replied, “I can’t answer why it all happened ... because there was no thought in my head whatsoever”. Ms Robilliard reported similarly. She said that the offender denied consciously associating Dean with Mr Shillingsworth or displacing feelings about Mr Shillingsworth onto the child. There is inconsistency between this and what the offender has said to others. She told police that, “all I could see when I looked at Dean was his father, Paul”. When she was first spoken to by police she said, “I just kept seeing his father and couldn’t stop myself”. 70 The account the offender gave to Dr Skinner was that Mr Connors interfered with her disciplining of Dean, for example, by telling him that he need not listen to her. She told Dr Skinner that Dean “just wouldn’t listen to me”. This was making her angry and made the situation worse as she felt frustrated and did not know what to do to manage Dean’s behaviour. In turn, Dean’s behaviour became worse. She had arguments with Mr Connors about Dean’s management. 71 She told Dr Skinner that she thought her problems had begun when she learned that Paul Shillingsworth had been released from gaol in August 2007 (Dr Skinner’s report says August 2006 but that must be a typographical error). She heard third hand that he had made a threat to kill her. She became fearful that he would do something to harm her. She told Dr Skinner how Mr Shillingsworth had been violent towards her in the past. She believed he had contacts in government agencies that would enable him to find out where she was living. She said that she stopped using cannabis two or three days before the offence because she had no money. She became frustrated, irritated, agitated and felt depressed. 72 There is some support for the offender’s claim of being in fear of Mr Shillingsworth in that Dr Skinner noted in the records of Ms Paenga, the caseworker, that Ms Paenga had noted that the offender was fearful of him and that these fears seemed very real for the offender. She also saw a note to the effect that the offender was very calm when she said that she could not stand Dean because he reminded her of his father. 73 Notwithstanding that fear, the offender has corresponded with Mr Shillingsworth whilst in custody. In a letter of 4 September 2008 she acknowledged his hurt and anger, said she wanted to give him answers but that she was still trying to come to terms with “it” herself. She wished him well, and similar, and signed off with “love always”. In a letter of 24 January 2009 she expressed similar sentiments. 74 While on the subject of these letters I should also record that there is a passage that tends to support what Dr Skinner said about the offender’s personality, particularly in relation to anger management. The offender wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        I’m locked down for 5 days in segro. It’s my 3rd inside charge, for knocking people out. This time I punched a girl with a hard knock, split her nose at the top, broke it and gave her a black eye which is causing her problems. The slut deserved it, wanting to run her mouth with me and push me. No cunt in here scares me. I seen the area manager, he’s making me hold a mediation with this girl as it’s the second time I bashed her. 
        
       
      
    75 The history given recently to Ms Robilliard included that in the weeks leading up to Dean’s death the offender knew that she was struggling to cope with him and was losing control. She claims that she was not given the support or assistance she was asking for. She told Ms Robilliard that she had asked her mother to take Dean and her mother refused. She also claimed to have asked her family support caseworker to take her to the Department of Community Services with the idea of surrendering Dean but was told not to do so as the other two children may also have been removed. I do not accept this history. It is contrary to other evidence which I have referred to earlier that is more reliable. 
     
      
    76 Trying to find a reason, or the reasons, for the offender killing her young son is a difficult exercise. The Crown submitted that there were multiple different and sometimes conflicting motives. I accept that there was a multiplicity of factors which are relevant but I would not describe them as “motives”. Rather, they are factors which were influential in the offender’s thinking at the time of the offence. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the following matters.77 In the weeks leading up to the murder the offender displayed considerable inappropriate and unjustified anger towards Dean. She had an irrational perception that he was deliberately misbehaving and defying her. Making him clean up after himself when he had a toileting accident and locking him out of the house are just two examples of her attitude of mistreatment of him. The fact that the offender had adequate and appropriate parenting skills in relation to her two other children demonstrates that her behaviour towards Dean was not an inherent inadequacy of skills but something that was targeted at him alone. 78 I am satisfied that she came to loathe Dean because he reminded her of his father towards whom she held ambivalent feelings. I am satisfied that in the weeks prior to the murder she was in fear of Mr Shillingsworth and, in that period, she more hated than loved him. She was also concerned that by retaining custody of Dean there was a greater prospect of Mr Shillingsworth finding out where she was living and doing her harm.79 Nevertheless, despite these feelings about Dean, she did not want to voluntarily surrender his care to others. She had ample opportunity to do so. Her caseworker was supportive of her and offered assistance which was not taken up. Her mother had also offered to assist. 80 I am satisfied that at the time she killed Dean the offender believed that the arrival of the police to execute the recovery order and take Dean from her was imminent. Even though she was not given any information when she called the Federal Magistrates Court that morning she must have assumed, and thereby believed, that the order was made as expected. 81 There is psychiatric opinion to the effect that the offender was feeling agitated and irritable from having abstained from cannabis abuse in the days leading up to the murder. I accept this but do not regard it as a factor of great significance. 82 I do not accept that the killing of Dean was the subject of any real planning by the offender. The Crown has pointed to the statement that she is said to have made the previous year – “I will kill Dean before he goes back with Ann” – in support of its submission that the offender had for some time had it in mind that killing him was an option. Mr Winch informed me this morning that there is a dispute about whether the offender made that statement. That is not something I need to resolve, although I should make the observation that there is no contradictory evidence. The conclusion I have reached is that I do not accept the Crown submission. Assuming that the statement was made, it was made so far in the past and had not been acted upon that I would be unable to conclude to the required standard that it was a continuing thought in the offender’s mind of a possible course of action to take. 83 My conclusion is that on the morning of 11 October 2007, under the influence of the various matters I have just outlined, the offender gave in to her anger and deliberately set about causing Dean really serious bodily harm. The mechanism by which death was caused is not sufficiently established to enable satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that she acted with an intention to kill. The fact that she immediately attempted resuscitation, if it be true, also tends to cast doubt upon her wanting the child dead. Her reaction in the immediate aftermath was one of panic, partly for what she had done but more so out of fear of being found out for what she had done. Dumping the child’s body in the duck pond was a further sign of loathing for him. The offender’s behaviour in maintaining a false account of Dean’s whereabouts to friends, family and the police over the course of the following week was calculated and callous. Her hope was that Dean’s body would never be found and she would escape unpunished. This conduct is consistent with the personality disorder Dr Skinner diagnosed. Objective seriousness of the offence and whether the standard non-parole period should be imposed84 Factors relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offender’s crime include the following. 85 The offence was not planned but was spontaneous.86 There was an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm rather than to kill. In her mind was the complex of thoughts and emotions I have outlined earlier. 87 She acted in breach of a position of trust and authority in respect of a victim who was her own son. Dean was entitled to love, protection and nurture but instead she took away his very life.88 The fact that the victim was a child is inherent in the offence that is the subject of the 25 year standard non-parole period but that applies to any person under the age of 18 years. In this case the child was extremely young, 2 years 8 months, and so it remains a matter in aggravation. It is axiomatic that a child of 2 is considerably more vulnerable than a child of 17. 89 The killing occurred in the light of the offender’s awareness that he was about to be recovered by the authorities and returned to his lawful guardian. 90 I am not satisfied that the offender was operating under any mental condition that reduced her moral culpability. I do not accept the diagnosis of Dr Nielssen that the offender was suffering from depression, at least at the time of the offence, which was “likely to have affected her perception of events, her capacity to judge right from wrong and her capacity to control her actions”. I accept that the she may well have experienced bouts of depression but I am not satisfied that it was operative at the time, and had a bearing upon, the commission of the offence. I accept the diagnosis of Dr Skinner that the offender has a severe personality disorder. The fact that this is a mental condition does not produce an automatic consequence that it reduces her moral culpability for the offence and in the circumstances of this case I do not find that it does.91 Lastly, it must be noted that the offence occurred as part of a course of mistreatment of Dean that had been going on for some weeks, at least. It was not an isolated aberration although obviously it was out of all proportion to what had gone on before. 92 The method of disposing of the body does not, in my view, bear upon the objective seriousness of the offence. It does, however, further indicate the offender’s callous disregard for her son and her primary purpose after his death of her own self preservation. It also provides further confirmation of the antisocial aspect of her personality disorder in that she had so little empathy that her own interests prevailed against any concern for her dead son.93 Weighing up all of the circumstances, some of which point in different directions, I am satisfied that the offence is below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the crime of murdering a child but, I hasten to add, only slightly so. 94 The standard non-parole period is applicable to an offence that falls within the middle of the range where there is conviction after trial. Here, of course, the offender pleaded guilty. So, there are two immediately obvious reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period but it still remains relevant as a benchmark against which to assess the appropriate sentence.Other sentencing considerations95 There are some further factors which must be taken into account in the assessment of sentence. There is the fact that the offender was on conditional liberty in the form of the suspended sentence bond at the time of the offence. This is an aggravating factor as I earlier observed. There is also the offender’s plea of guilty which the law requires me to take into account in her favour.96 The plea of guilty came almost 2 years after the offender was arrested and charged, 10 months after she was committed for trial and almost 3 weeks before her trial was scheduled to commence. I accept that she made admissions to the police following her arrest. There was no issue insofar as I am aware of her fitness to be tried. There was an issue as to whether the defence of substantial impairment could be made out but she did not enter a plea of guilty to anything until 5 June 2009 when she pleaded guilty to manslaughter. The Crown did not accept that plea. There had been an earlier offer to plead guilty to manslaughter that was communicated to the Crown by a letter from the offender’s solicitors in October 2008. The Crown did not accept that offer.  
     
      
    97 The offender was re-arraigned on 18 August 2009 and pleaded guilty to murder. She has, thereby, acknowledged that by her deliberate act she caused the death and that accompanying her act was at least an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. These circumstances are not exceptional in my view so as to warrant a discount “towards the top of the range” as was submitted on the offender’s behalf. The plea did, however, have some utilitarian value for the criminal justice system and I propose to reflect it with a discount on the sentence I would otherwise have imposed in the order of 15 percent.98 I am not persuaded that I should make a finding of remorse in the offender’s favour. She has not given evidence herself that would enable me to conclude that she has accepted responsibility for her actions and acknowledged the loss that she caused: s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Ms Robilliard reported that, “Rachael expressed guilt and remorse over Dean’s death” and Ms Robilliard wrote that this appeared to be sincere. Again, not having seen and heard the offender give evidence, I have been denied the opportunity to make an assessment for myself.99 Another matter I should mention is that in assessing the sentence to impose I have taken into account the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In a matter involving the murder of a young child, general deterrence, denouncing the offender’s conduct and making her accountable for her actions are particularly important. 
     
      
    100 I am not prepared to make findings in her favour that she is unlikely to re-offend or that she has good prospects of rehabilitation. The psychiatric and psychological evidence which I accept, particularly that of Dr Skinner and Ms Robilliard, warrants considerable scepticism about those matters. 
     
      
    Comparable cases101 I was provided with references to a number of other cases involving the murder of children. The vast majority are concerned with sentencing prior to the enactment of the standard non-parole period for the murder of a child and for that reason alone they are of very limited utility. I was informed that there have been two cases since that enactment – R v PJS [2009] NSWSC 153 and R v BW & SW (No 3)  [2009] NSWSC 1043. I am well aware of the latter. The circumstances of that case were significantly different to those of the present case, involving as it did the killing of a seven year old girl by deliberate starvation over an extended period of time after years of the most profound mistreatment and neglect. R v PJS involved the violent killing of a three year old step-daughter by both blunt and sharp force trauma over a sustained period whilst the offender was intoxicated. He was convicted after a trial and continued to profess his innocence. There were no subjective mitigating features. The sentence imposed was one of 26 years with a non-parole period of 20 years. However I note that the sentencing judge found that the offence fell “above the mid-range of objective criminality, although not substantially so”. She said that if it was not for the fact that the offender was in protective custody a sentence involving a non-parole period of 26 years would have been imposed. These cases do not establish any tariff or range and so I do not find them to be of any great assistance.Concurrence of accumulation102 There is a question as to whether the sentence should be concurrent with, or accumulative, either partially or wholly, upon the non-parole period of the sentence that was the subject of the suspended sentence bond. In my view it would be appropriate to wholly accumulate the sentence upon the non-parole period for that sentence because it was imposed for an offence committed against a different victim at a different time. The non-parole period was relatively modest, only 6 months, and so I do not think that the totality principle calls for any degree of concurrence.SENTENCE103 Convicted 
     
      
      Sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 19 years 2 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 6 years 4 months. 
      
     
     
      
      The sentence will date from 20 April 2008. The offender will be eligible for release on the expiration of the non-parole period on 19 June 2027. 
      
     
     
      
      That is a total sentence of 25 years 6 months. Without the plea of guilty the sentence would have been one of 30 years.

     Marcus PUHAKKA v Regina 
      
     JUDGMENT  
    1 MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Blanch J.2 BLANCH J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court on 30 April, 2009. On that day he was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
      1. On count 1 for an offence of possess child pornography contrary to s91H(3) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 5 years, he was sentenced to “a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 30 April, 2009 and conclude on 29 April, 2011”; 
      
     
     
      
      2. On count 2 which was also a charge of possess child pornography contrary to s91H(3) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       and taking into account one matter of possess child pornography on a Form 1, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years from 30 April, 2010 with an additional term of 12 months. 
      
    The effective overall sentence was one of 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years.3 A summary of facts was tendered before the sentencing judge indicating that as a result of information received from authorities in the USA, police began an investigation into the activities of the applicant. It appeared that there was a transfer to the applicant of a child pornography picture involving two children, one male and one female engaged in sexual intercourse with an adult male. This transfer was on 28 June, 2003 at which time the applicant was 15 years of age. In January, 2008 police conducted a search of the applicant’s premises and they seized computer hard drives, rewritable compact disks, rewritable digital versatile compact disks, newspaper articles relating to child pornography and erotic sex stories involving the rape of children as young as two. The police examined 25,000 files which represented 25% of the files on the hard drive and 834 child pornography picture images were located, including animated and real life children engaged in sexual intercourse with adults. In addition, 77 video files were located, including footage of sexual intercourse involving children with adults. Some showed children clearly distressed and in pain while being assaulted. The files were downloaded between 2006 and December, 2007.4 The first count in the indictment related to material found on the hard drive. Police were able to access 45 video files and found images that ranged on the COPINE scale from a level 5 through to level 10 which is the most serious category. These videos depicted girls aged between three and 14 performing sexual acts with adult males.5 Count 2 referred to images found on the compact disks. One of the compact disks depicted a cartoon of a dog having sexual intercourse with a girl apparently under the age of ten. There were 14 videos with a COPINE rating of 10 and included videos of a baby bound and sexually assaulted, a two year old girl subjected to anal intercourse, numerous images of young girls apparently heavily sedated being sexually assaulted and a girl under ten bound and subjected to an act of anal intercourse while crying with the pain.6 The matter on the Form 1 related to the printed document telling the story of a volunteer who went to work at a child orphanage. There he sexually assaults a two year old child.7 The applicant at the time of sentence was aged 20. He was in third year at the University of New South Wales studying Materials Engineering. He had no prior criminal history. On his behalf in the sentencing proceedings, there was tendered a psychological report from the Department of Corrective Services. That report indicated he was born in Australia. His parents separated when he was three and until six he lived between his mother and father but his mother eventually obtained full custody of him. His mother remarried and at sentence he had a half-sister aged 12. He denied any physical, sexual or emotional abuse as a child. That report said he “… displayed little insight and little affect regarding the charges.” The report also noted he had viewed pornography from an early age and his sexual development possibly became conditioned because of that.8 A report was also tendered from Dr Westmore, psychiatrist dated 14 November, 2008. This report states the applicant has never had sexual contact with another person and that he started accessing pornographic sites on the internet when he was ten years of age. Dr Westmore thought he had some insight into the inappropriateness of his behaviour. He thought the applicant had possibly learned inappropriate sexual behaviour from his access to the internet and because of that it could be “unlearned”. He recommended continuing treatment by a psychologist.9 The first ground of appeal is that the sentencing judge failed to give effect to his finding of special circumstances. The sentencing judge did say “The offender has no criminal record and this will be his first experience of prison and that fact together with his age I consider to be a special circumstance to vary the statutory ratio.” It appears to me that in making that assessment he was referring to the total sentence to be contemplated and not just one of the offences. It is also the fact that the ultimate sentence of 4 years with a 3 year non-parole period reflects the statutory ratio and does not give effect to that statement by the sentencing judge. In my view the finding that there were special circumstances to vary the statutory ratio was appropriate. It was not only because the applicant is a young man going to gaol for the first time in circumstances where he has no prior criminal history. It is also because of Dr Westmore’s opinion that he has learned deviant behaviour and he now has some insight into that and is capable of unlearning it with appropriate assistance.10 The second ground of appeal points to the fact that on the first count the sentencing judge did not fix a balance of term but simply imposed a non-parole period. That submission is also well founded and in my view, the sentence imposed should be expressed as a fixed term of 2 years.11 The other grounds of appeal are directed at the imposition of a partly cumulative sentence, giving insufficient weight to subjective features and the assertion that the sentence is manifestly excessive. There is no doubt the offences are serious and that general deterrence must form a significant element in the sentencing process. In R v Rodric David Booth [2009] NSWCCA 89 Simpson J said at [40]-[43]: 
     
      
      “It seems to me that possession of child pornography is an offence which is particularly one to which notions of general deterrence apply. Possession of child pornography is a callous and predatory crime. 
      
     
     
      
      In sentencing for such a crime, it is well to bear firmly in mind that the material in question cannot come into existence without exploitation and abuse of children somewhere in the world. Often this is in underdeveloped or disadvantaged countries that lack the resources to provide adequate child protection mechanisms. The damage done to the children may be, and undoubtedly often is, profound. Those who make use of the product feed upon that exploitation and abuse, and upon the poverty of the children the subject of the material. 
      
     
     
      
      What makes the crime callous is not just that is exploits and abuses children; it is callous because, each time the material is viewed, the offender is reminded of and confronted with obvious pictorial evidence of that exploitation and abuse, and the degradation it causes. 
      
     
     
      
      And every occasion on which an internet child pornography site is accessed (or when such material is accessed by any means at all) provides further encouragement to expand their activities to those who create and purvey the material.” 
      
    12 That case dealt with an offender who had been given a bond for possession of pornography. The images there involved what appeared to be more than 100 images of young males, many under the age of ten involved in sexual activity including with adult males and a video. On a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 months with a balance of term of 18 months. The offender in that case had a prior conviction which involved 14 offences of sexual misconduct with a boy aged about 11 or 12. He had been sentenced for those offences and for possession of child pornography to a minimum term of 5 years with an additional term of 3 years. 13 In Saddler v R [2009] NSWCCA 83 Buddin J was dealing with a case involving 45,000 images and 700 child pornography movies. It involved children from below the age of one to toddlers, both boys and girls involved in sexual activity with adults and some involved children performing sexual acts with a dog. In that case the sentence was reduced to a total term of a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months with a balance of term of 1 year and 3 months. The offender in that case had a criminal record including two previous sentences of imprisonment, one involving a minimum term of 3 years for assault and robbery and another involving a minimum term of 3 years with a non-parole period of 12 months for an offence of sexual intercourse without consent. In the course of his judgment, his Honour referred to a number of other cases involving the possession of child pornography. They included: 
     
      
      1.  
      R v Gent 
       (2005) 162 A Crim R 29 involving the importation of child pornography which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years. It involved images of boys aged between 8 and 11 and girls aged between 6 and 14 including sado-masochistic images. The offender had no prior convictions and was sentenced to 18 months with a non-parole period of 12 months. 
      
     
     
      
      2.  
      Power v the DPP, 
       NSWDC unreported 19 July 2007 – the material included 31 videos of men engaged in sexual activity with children under 10 and adolescents. It included a video of a five year old child handcuffed and anally raped. There were 28,000 images of pornography of which 433 involved children. The offender had no prior convictions and was ultimately sentenced to 15 months with a non-parole period of 6 months. 
      
     
     
      
      3. In  
      Mouscas v R 
       [2008] NSWCCA 181 there were 41,923 files and 251 video files depicting oral, anal and vaginal sex with girls as young as four or five. It included photographs of children involved in sexual acts with animals. There were many hundreds of victims depicted, the offender had no prior record and was sentenced to 2 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 18 months. 
      
     
     
      
      4. In  
      R v Leonard 
       [2008] NSWDC 211 the offender had 276 images depicting naked male children aged between seven and 13 in erotic or sexual poses. He had a prior history of convictions for child sexual assault. He was 74 with health problems and was sentenced to 12 months with a 9 month non-parole period. 
      
     
     
      
      5. In  
      R v Elliott  
      [2008] NSWDC 238 the offender pleaded guilty to five charges of possession and four of disseminating child pornography. He was arrested as a result of information received from the USA. The charges involved 17 child pornography movie films depicting adolescent males between 10 and 15 involved in sexual activity, 27 movie files and approximately 3,100 still images, some of which rated between 7 and 10 on the COPINE scale. The images involved children as young as two being subjected to pain and humiliation. Some of the images involved penetration of young children causing obvious pain and distress. On the hard drive of his computer, there were 29,000 images of male children engaged in sexual activity with one another and with adults. Most of the images were assessed as being between 7 and 10 on the COPINE scale. The offender was 51 without prior convictions. He was sentenced to a term of 5 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 1 month. 
      
     
     
      
      6. In  
      R v Jones 
       [2009] NSWDC 8 the offender pleaded guilty to two counts involving images of girls between six and 12. His computer contained 51 images and one video of child pornography. There were 25 compact disks containing 23,000 image files and 220 video files of child pornography. Many of the images were assessed at levels 9 or 10 on the COPINE scale. Children involved babies and 18 month old toddlers. Images involved children showing pain and distress. The offender was 64 without a prior criminal history. He suffered from significant health problems. He was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months with a 20 month non-parole period by way of periodic detention.  
      
     
     
      
      7. In the recent case of  
      Sivell v R 
       [2009] NSWCCA 286 – the offender failed in an appeal against the severity of a sentence of a non-parole period of 1 year 11 months with a balance of term of 10 months. He was found in possession of a computer disk containing 85 pornographic images of young females aged between five and ten and links to pornographic internet websites. The files were saved between March and October, 2006. The sentencing judge classified them as falling into categories 6 or 7 on the COPINE scale. The offender had an extensive criminal history including for sexual offences related to female children. He was also in breach of an order under the  
      Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act. 
      
    14 It is noted that the offences involved in the above cases were prior to the amendment to the Act in January, 2009 when the maximum penalty for possessing child pornography was increased to 10 years.15 This survey of cases reveals a wide range of sentences. Despite that they are consistent in denouncing this offence and emphasising the need for deterrent sentence. The main factor differentiating the sentences appears to be the subjective factors relating to the offender including age, prior criminal history and prospects of rehabilitation.16 In this case the key subjective circumstances are the young age of the offender, his lack of criminal convictions and his prospects of rehabilitation appear to be good. His offending behaviour arose from his isolated social situation. The assessment has been made that he may be able to unlearn that behaviour and he was a third year university student with a professional career in prospect. Dr Westmore said “I think his prognosis should be considered cautiously but perhaps with some optimism, particularly if he can continue the psychologist and particularly if therapy reveals that his primary or basic sexual drive is not of a paedophile type.” The assessment of the sentencing judge was undoubtedly correct that special circumstances exist to vary the statutory ratio, it is appropriate now to re-sentence the applicant in order to give effect to that assessment. The re-sentencing should reflect the applicant’s prospects for rehabilitation. 17 On the first count I would rectify the sentence and grant leave to appeal, quash the sentence imposed and instead impose a sentence of 2 years fixed term to date from 30 April, 2009. It is a fixed term because it will be concurrent with the second sentence. It is appropriate for the sentences to be concurrent because the nature of the material found is the same in respect of each count.18 On the second count and taking into account the matter on the Form 1, I would grant leave to appeal, quash the sentence imposed and impose a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 30 April, 2009 and a balance of term of 1 year. I would order his release to parole on 29 April, 2011.19 JOHNSON J: I agree with Blanch J.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Anthony Tally is to be sentenced today for a number of offences committed some distance apart in time. The first of those offences occurred as long ago as 17 August 1997. The reason that it is being prosecuted after such a lengthy delay is because that it was through the use of DNA analysis that the offender was detected as being the person responsible for the most serious offence and his DNA sample was only taken for comparison comparatively recently. The fact that it was committed so long ago and that I am sentencing him now after a lapse of more than twelve years produces a number of relevant considerations.2 A victim impact statement was read by the victim of the matter. Her distress at the offence and the consequences for her of an offence committed so long ago was apparent even to this day. The reaction of Ms M, the victim of that offence and the consequences for her as reported in the victim impact statement confirm in a most graphic way the assumption that has been made by Judges from time to time that the consequences of offending of this type are long lasting and likely permanent. Ms M feels the results of the offenders conduct deeply to this day. It has affected her irrevocably.3 What the offender did on 17 August 1997 was to approach her as she was walking along the street, threatened her with a screwdriver and forced her to have sexual intercourse with him. Ms M was only twenty-one years old that day. She was walking along a road in Strathfield when she turned around and saw the offender coming towards her with a screwdriver in his hand. She began screaming, not surprisingly, but instead of running away the offender was determined to have sex with her. He said “If you don’t stop screaming I’ll kill you”. As a result of that most violent threat, Ms M did stop screaming. She offered him money but the offender replied succinctly “Shut up, I want to fuck you”. He pushed her over a sandstone wall into someone’s property and made her climb over a fence. He was holding the screwdriver to Ms M’s throat as he did so. She tried to talk him out of it saying “You don't have to do this, you really don’t have to do this”. She told him that she had her period but the offender’s response was simply “I really don't care”. Eventually he undid her jeans and pulled them down. He made her take her tampon out, pushed her over and laid down on top of her. He penetrated her vagina with his penis, removing it after about five seconds. He stopped and told Ms M to go away. She did and went to a friend’s house. Police were contacted and she was taken to Westmead Hospital. Forensic analysis of the material supplied as a result of the examination of Ms M revealed a DNA profile which was later shown to match that of the offender.4 That as I said was in 1997. At the time of that offence the offender was on conditional liberty. In fact he was on parole at the time having been released from custody not that long before. Between 1997 and 2007, the offender committed some further offences but nothing even approaching the seriousness of the offence of aggravated sexual assault.5 That brings us to the other offences which the offender is to be sentenced today. They are a series of break enter and steal matters committed in late 2007. Additionally there are other matters, one of larceny, one of aggravated break enter and steal and a number of other similar matters involving breaking and entering either to steal or with intent committed almost all in late 2007 (although there was one in 2003 and another one of larceny in 2006). He asks that I take those matters into account on a Form 1 when I sentence him for the offence of aggravated sexual assault.6 The offender’s modus operandi was to go to residential premises, use a rock to break through a window or a door, gain entry and take what he could find. It was a common practice of his also to take a drink from the fridge, have some and leave the bottle behind. Each time he did this, he left some of his DNA for the police to find and it was through those means that almost all of the 2007 offences were discovered. The break enter and steal offences were unremarkable. That description in itself is certainly not intended to suggest that the offences were not serious. It is distressingly common for householders to find that drug addicts such as the offender caring nothing about their rights and their feelings, break into their homes and take items of value which they then immediately sell so that they can support a drug habit. Simply because offences such as these were common place does not make them any less serious. 7 One of the important matters to take into account in assessing the objective gravity of offences such as the latter group of offences for which the offender is to be sentenced concerns the nature of the property taken. The offender on occasions took property of significant value, on one occasion taking jewellery to the value of $43,658.00. On occasions also property which must have had significant sentimental value was taken as well. The consequences and the harm caused by offences of break enter and steal do not only flow to the unfortunate householders who had their homes broken into and their property taken, but all of us suffer because of the prevalence of offences such as these through the need to install additional security on our homes, the need to pay higher insurance premiums, all because offenders such as Mr Tally choose to fund their drug addiction by the commission of serious criminal offences.8 The maximum penalty for the aggravated sexual assault matter is twenty years imprisonment and the maximum penalties for each of the remaining offences for which the offender is to be specifically sentenced is fourteen years. One of the offences on the Form 1 carries a maximum penalty of twenty years with a standard non-parole period of five years but of course that standard non-parole period has no application given that the matter is on a Form 1.9 Concern has sometimes been expressed by judicial officers at the placement on a Form 1 of matters carrying a standard non-parole period. In circumstances such as these, the offender can consider himself quite fortunate that the prosecution has chosen to do what it did. I also mention that there is no standard non-parole period for the aggravated sexual assault. Had the offence been committed today there would have been but at the time that the offence was committed the standard non-parole period had not yet been introduced. The age of the aggravated sexual assault matter is clearly an important consideration as I mentioned at the outset of these remarks. One particular aspect which the offender is entitled to rely on is that despite this offence occurring over twelve years ago, no similar offence appears on his criminal history. Nor, and I should say at this stage, is there an offence of that kind or any sexual offence of any nature anywhere on his criminal history. That tends to suggest that this offence may well be an isolated one. The same however cannot be said about the break enter and steal offences.10 The offender was born in 1972. He has an extensive criminal history and a great deal of involvement with the criminal justice system generally and the Probation and Parole Service specifically. He has been supervised by the Probation and Parole Service on many occasions, sometimes satisfactorily and other times not so.11 The offender is an only child. His parents separated when he was very young and he has had minimal contact with his natural father. His mother was only seventeen when she fell pregnant with him. The offender’s upbringing was much less than satisfactory. The unfortunate circumstances surrounding his upbringing are well detailed in the many reports that were tendered on the offender’s behalf. His upbringing was affected by external matters such as the many negative influences to which he was exposed whilst he was growing up and the absence of positive influences as well as matters internal to the offender who from a very young age exhibited symptoms consistent with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. In recent times there may have been some doubt cast upon precisely what condition the offender suffers from but the symptoms which his mother described today are of significant problems controlling his impulses. Some of the psychological material suggests that it is entirely possible that as the offender ages his problems with impulsivity will reduce. Indeed the offence of aggravated sexual assault, the most serious offence for which the offender is to be sentenced today, related to just what I have been describing, impulsive behaviour and the offender remembers this offence well. He told a psychologist that he had the screwdriver because he was out breaking into cars but decided on the spur of the moment that he would sexually assault a young woman he saw walking down the street.12 He has expressed his remorse for that offence to the psychologist and his mother although he himself did not give evidence today. That is one qualification to the finding of remorse. The other of course is that although he told the psychologist that he remembered the offence well, he denied that he had threatened the victim with the screwdriver, a matter he now admits.13 The law is that when sentencing for an old offence I do not impose a sentence as if the offence was committed more recently and that the sentencing regime and sentencing ranges appropriate at the time are what should guide me. This, as has been recognised in the authorities can occasionally lead to some difficulties. On occasions, the Court of Criminal Appeal has suggested that Judges can use their own experience in criminal law to guide them, a matter which really only can be effective where the Judge has appropriate experience. Ms Manuell assisted me by obtaining statistics from the Judicial Commission. She was able to provide me with statistics showing sentences for offences under s 61J of the Crimes Act which were not subject to a standard non-parole period. They are a good indication of the sentencing regime and range which would have been appropriate in 1997. I also use my recollection of sentences that were imposed in the late nineties in determining what would have happened to the offender had he been dealt with for this offence of aggravated sexual assault at that time.14 The 1997 offence I hope I have made clear, was a very serious one. Young women are entitled to walk the streets at night or even in the early hours of the morning without needing armed guards to protect them. Of course many young women are vulnerable but that is not their fault. The Courts must do what they can to protect women in the position that Ms M was that day. Sentences involving a substantial component of general deterrence are necessary and will be imposed in this case even despite the matters referred to in the various psychological reports.15 The offender pleaded guilty to all of these offences at an early stage and so as is agreed by the Crown, the sentence should be twenty-five per cent or approximately twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise have been. The High Court decision of R v Pearce [1998] HCA 57 of course applies and so the offender is to be separately sentenced for each offence taking into account the objective gravity of each different offence and the circumstances that relate to him. Clearly the offender, despite his lengthy criminal history, would benefit from an extended period of supervision on parole and so I will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour. This is not as a means of extending leniency to him at all but results from the fact that one day the offender is to be released into the community and it is far better that upon that release he is given the assistance of the Probation and Parole Service in order to ensure as far as is possible that he commits no further offences. The community would thus benefit from that extended period of supervision on parole.16 For the offences of break enter and steal numbered B and C on the Crown’s sentence summary, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, I set a fixed term of two years to date from 18 January 2008. For the break enter and steal matters D, E and F on the Crown’s sentence summary, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of imprisonment of two years to date from 18 January 2009. Those sentences are fixed terms because of the sentence I now announce on the aggravated sexual assault matter. For that offence the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of four years to date from 18 January 2010 and I set a head sentence of seven years. This means that the overall sentence is one of nine years with a six year non-parole period.

   JUDGMENT1. The Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (the Act) was enacted to protect persons from domestic and personal violence. Listed among the objects for the Act is to ensure the safety and protection of all persons who experience personal violence outside a domestic relationship. The Act aims to achieve that objective by numerous means, including ensuring that access to the courts is safe, speedy, inexpensive and simple, as is consistent with justice.2. Frankly, that has not occurred in this case. Events giving rise to the issues between the appellant and respondent began in and, on one view of the case before, 2006. 3. The court journey began on 3 November 2006 when MD, the respondent and hereafter the complainant, sought protection offered by the Act based upon writings, principally letters, authored by Paul Garde, the appellant and hereafter the defendant. As a consequence of the complaint, the defendant was summonsed to appear in the Local Court on 17 November 2006 to answer the complaint and be dealt with according to law. 4. There were five appearances before the Local Court, before a hearing was embarked upon before Magistrate Forbes on 29 June 2007. It was adjourned part-heard. A further date was set for early October. On that occasion the defendant failed to attend. It proceeded ex parte. Further evidence was led on that occasion, and orders made against the defendant prohibiting, inter alia, intimidation and the distribution of personal or financial information. Orders were also made in respect of costs. 5. The defendant launched an appeal to the District Court. In the face of ex parte orders it was held an appeal was not an appropriate remedy. An annulment of the Local Court proceedings was required. Time was passing. An annulment was granted conditional upon the evidence thus far led being preserved and the matter going before a replacement magistrate. The need for replacement was occasioned by the retirement of Magistrate Forbes. Time was passing. 6. On 5 March 2009 the matter was allocated to Magistrate Curran. He completed the matter the following day. His Honour made orders against the defendant, namely the mandatory orders described as A, B, C, which included a prohibition against intimidating the complainant. His Honour further ordered: 
     
      
      “The defendant not post any material referring directly or indirectly to the complainant on the noticeboard of the owners’ corporation, and the defendant not distribute personal or financial information about the complainant to any other residents.” 
       
      
    Finally, his Honour made an order for costs. The defendant appealed to this court against the orders made in the Local Court. This appeal was lodged on 1 April 2009. A further eight months have now passed before the parties have a resolution to a problem first raised before the courts in November 2006. Frankly, the resolution of this matter cannot be described as “speedy, inexpensive and simple as is consistent with justice”. Jurisdictional and Procedural Issues7. Three issues have arisen as to the jurisdictional nature of an apprehended personal violence order appeal to the District Court. Firstly, whether on a rehearing any judgment can only be given as ought to have been given at the original hearing; that is, whether the judgment should be given regarding time, events and the law as frozen. 8. The second issue was whether evidence rejected for tender at the original hearing could be retendered in this hearing in the event the circumstances have changed. Thirdly, whether the judgment of the Local Court should be received in evidence. 9. The appeal is brought pursuant to s 84 of the Act. Relevantly that section provides: 
     
      
      “ 
      84 Review and appeal provisions concerning making etc of apprehended violence orders 
      : 
       
       
      (1)... 
       
       
      (2) An appeal may be made to the District Court: 
       
        (a) by the defendant against the making of an apprehended violence order by the Local Court... 
       
      
      
      
      (3) An appeal under subs (2):  
       
        (a) may be made under Part 3 of the  
       Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
        2001 
       , in the same way as an application may be made under that Part by a defendant against a conviction arising from a court attendance notice dealt with under Part 2 of Chapter 4 of the  
       Criminal Procedure Act 
        1986 
       , and... 
       
      
      
      
      (4) The  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
        
      2001 
       applies to an application or appeal arising under this section, with such modifications as are made by or in accordance with regulations under that Act... 
       
       
      (5)... 
       
       
      (6) In this section  
      ‘party’ 
       to an apprehended violence order means: 
       
       
       (a) The protected person (whether or not the applicant) but only if the protected person is above the age of sixteen years, or... 
      
      
      (c) The defendant.” 
      
    The relevant provisions of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 applying to an APVO appeal is s 18: 
     
      
      (18) Appeals against convictions to be by way of rehearing on the transcripts of evidence: 
       
       
      (1) An appeal against conviction is to be by way of rehearing on the basis of evidence given in the Local Court proceedings... 
       
       
      (2) Fresh evidence may be given, but only by leave of the District Court which may be granted only if the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that fresh evidence be given. 
       
       
      (3)...” 
       
      
    Within the definitions section (s 3), fresh evidence is defined as: 
     
      
      “ 
      Fresh evidence 
      . In relation to appeal proceedings means evidence in addition to or in substitution of the evidence given in the proceedings from which the appeal proceedings have arisen.” 
       
      
    An analysis of an appeal by way of a rehearing where further additional evidence is received was given in 1971 by Barwick CJ. It is a useful starting point (see Edwards v Noble (1971) 125 CLR 298 at E304): 
     
      
      “...The consequence of that description of the appeal is that the appeal is one of fact, as well as on law, and that the appellate court in deciding it may apply the law as it may then exist: 
       
       
      Further, where additional evidence has been received it may do so in the light of that evidence, along with what had been adduced before the court from which the appeal is brought. A rehearing is not, however, a retrial of the issues...” 
       
      
    In Camilleri Stock Feeds Pty v EPA (1993) 32 NSWLR 683 at p 689, Kirby P reached a conclusion that: 
     
      
      “Appeal by ‘way of rehearing’ must, by the nature of the wording and context of the subsection, be considered in the light of the words “on the evidence...given in the proceedings before”, and “on any evidence in addition to or in substitution for the evidence so given”. 
       
       
      Clearly, the ""rehearing"" proceeds by the terms of the subsection upon the basis of the evidence before the Land and Environment Court. This requirement is qualified by the facility of ""addition"" to or ""substitution"" for such evidence. This must be so because the words are qualfied by ""and"". The context does not lend itself to an interpretation the conferral of jurisdiction of an original nature, such as a hearing de novo generally requires. In such a de novo appeal the matter is entirely relitigated and determined on "" 
      completely 
      new evidence"". (emphasis in original)

      “It is clear from the terms of s 18 that an appeal to the District Court by a defendant in the Local Court is not merely a mechanism which, once invoked, allows the trial to be started afresh. The appeal is to be conducted on the basis of certified transcripts of the evidence given in the Local Court and fresh evidence may only be given with leave of the court.” 
      
    Section 18 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 was also the subject of CCA analysis in Charara v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 244. In this case Mason P, speaking with approval of Kirby and Hoeben JJ, said: 
     
      
       “[17] The appeal is to be by way of rehearing on the Local Court transcripts, obviously supplemented by reference to any exhibits tendered in the Local Court. Fresh evidence may be given by leave subject to the District Court being satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that this should occur. 
       
       
      [18] The District Court is then required to apply the principles governing appeals from a judge sitting without a jury. The judge is to form his or her own judgment of the facts so far as able to do so, ie recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called in the lower court. 
       
       
      [19] The nature of an appeal “ 
      by way of rehearing” 
       has been discussed in many cases. The procedure to be adopted, powers to be exercised and functions to be performed must first be sought in the language of the particular statute. One thing, however, is clear “ 
      the ‘rehearing’” 
       does not involve a completely fresh hearing in the appellate court of all of the evidence. That court proceeds on the basis of the record and any fresh evidence that, exceptionally, it admits.” (References omitted.) 
       
       
      
    11. The first issue raised is whether, as with many appeals to superior courts, the appeal judgment is given repairing or confirming the judgment as it ought to have been given in the court below in the original hearing - time, circumstance and law frozen to reflect time, circumstance and law at the time of the original judgment. That matter has already been referred to in Edwards v Noble but it is more fully dealt with in Ex Parte Currie v Dempsey (1968) 70 SR 1 at p10. In that case Jacobs and Holmes JJ, speaking as a majority, were seeking to distinguish between an appeal in the strict sense of that term and a “rehearing” by commencing with a passage from an English Court of Appeal judgment: 
     
      
      “On an appeal strictly so called such a judgment can only be given as ought to have been given at the original hearing; but on a rehearing such a judgment may be given as ought to be given if the case came at the time before the court of first instance. 
       
       
      ...The distinction generally to be drawn is a distinction between an appeal which, although it may involve a reconsideration of the evidence, can only involve a reconsideration of evidence already given in the lower court in the light of the law as it existed at the time of the lower court’s decision and an appeal by way of rehearing which would usually involve a duty to give a decision appropriate in fact and in law as at the date of the hearing of the appeal.” 
       
       
      
    12. I indicated during the course of argument that I would be holding the court’s mandate to receive fresh evidence extended to receiving evidence from the complainant as to the continuation of any fear he may still have of intimidation from the defendant. I indicated my finding of the subjective element of fear and the objective consideration of whether there were reasonable grounds for such fear would be based not only on historical matters revealed by the record of evidence before the Local Court, but upon my assessment of a contemporary situation whether or not evidence was called by the complainant. Over objection, leave was given to the complainant to adduce fresh evidence on these topics. The complainant also sought leave to adduce evidence rejected by the magistrate, namely further examples of writings by the defendant where it was asserted before the magistrate, inter alia, he (the defendant) stated facts and opinions of a derogatory nature subsequent to the filing of a complaint. The magistrate excluded the tender on the basis of inadequate notice of those documents to the defence.13. Clearly those documents did not form part of the evidence before the magistrate. Their status was documents that had been excluded from evidence in the exercise of discretion by the magistrate. Insofar as s 18(1) of the Crimes (Local Court Appeal and Review) Act was concerned they were not admissible. On reflection, however, they may have qualified as fresh evidence on the basis that they were “evidence in addition to the evidence given in the [original] proceedings.” Insofar as 18(2) was concerned I was mindful “that receiving any fresh evidence is exceptional under s 18(2) and also when the adversary principles discussed in the Queen v Apostolides (1984) 154 CLR 563 are kept in mind.” (See Chara ante). Nonetheless, I accept there may be reasons when it will be in the interests of justice that evidence excluded, particularly if wrongly excluded in the Local Court hearing, could be given at the rehearing proceedings. As events turned out, however, I also excluded the earlier excluded evidence on the same basis as it had been excluded before the magistrate.14. The second issue was whether I should have rejected the remarks and findings of Curran LCM. These remarks and findings did not form part of the record of evidence. The evidence of the complainant was not put in issue by evidence from the defence, nor did the cross-examination conducted, as events turned out by the defendant, attack the veracity of the complainant. Indeed, in his submissions to the learned magistrate the defendant conceded the complainant may well have experienced fear but circumstances had changed so drastically by March of 2009 that it would be unreasonable to act on those fears. In reality, there was no credibility issue arising from the Local Court judgment.15. Mr Hand, counsel for the defendant, argued I should not receive the judgment. His argument was that I was equally as well placed as his Honour in the court below to evaluate the issues. My initial response was to reject access to the Local Court magistrate’s remarks. Indeed, the first day of the hearing had been before Forbes LCM seventeen months earlier. The second magistrate had had to read those earlier transcripts himself. The pronouncement from the Court of Criminal Appeal on this matter is hardly strong. Indeed, Mason P by way of obiter and in circumstances where he notes the point had not been argued in Chara said at para [23]-[24]; 
     
      
      23. Howie and Johnson  
      Criminal Practice and Procedure NSW 
       state that the reasons of the magistrate for finding the offence proved are not “evidence” and that the District Court may not have regard to those reasons unless the parties consent to that course. The point has not been argued before us, but I wish to express my doubts as to the correctness of this opinion of the learned authors. District Court judges traditionally and understandably refrain from reading the reasons of the Local Court when the appealing was  
      de novo 
      . But the nature of an appeal by way of rehearing on the transcript indicates to me that this approach is no longer justified. The magistrate’s reasons are not part of the “certified transcript of evidence” referred to in s.18(1) any more than the exhibits tendered in the Local Court. Nevertheless, as I see it, the District Court is impliedly directed to consider the reasons because the stated appellate function could not properly take place without reference to them. 
       
       
      24. The Local Court reasons will doubtless include an explanation why the conviction was entered at first instance, including an assessment of the credibility issues touching any factual dispute. Without reference to the reasons, the District Court would be driven to speculation or deciding the issues entirely afresh. Neither such course would be consonant with the statutory scheme... 
       
       
      
    16. Earlier in the same judgment the President had quoted a passage from Fox v Percy (2003) 214 CLR 118 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ at p 118 [22]: 
     
      
      “...these limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with a trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses’ credibility and of the ‘feeling’ of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcripts, cannot always fully share. Furthermore the appellate court does not typically get taken to or read all of the evidence taken at the trial. Commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity normally over a long interval to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it viewed as a whole.” 
       
       
      
    17. As a matter of practicality it seems to me the judge conducting the rehearing is able to reduce, if not minimise, the disadvantages of not seeing and hearing the witnesses and being part of the ambience of the case below by reading the remarks and understanding the basis for finding of the court below. It was on this basis that I accepted that I should inform myself of his Honour’s remarks.18. A third issue concerned me as to who was, as it were, to prosecute the appeal. The parties agreed the burden to establish the need for an order still fell upon the complainant even though he was not the respondent to this appeal. Authority for this proposition is also to be found in the Gianoutsos case earlier referred to at p 546 [42]: 
     
      
      “Although the appeal was by way of rehearing the onus remained on the appellant, Dr Gianoutsos, to prove his case to the relevant standard. The duty of the District Court judge was to determine the matter having regard to the evidence tendered in the Local Court and any further evidence admitted on the appeal...” 
       
       
      
    19. In those circumstances it fell to the complainant to establish the magistrate’s apprehended personal violence orders were still called for.The Court’s Task 
     
      
    20. The Court if satisfied on the balance of probabilities that a complainant has reasonable grounds to fear and does in fact fear the engagement by the defendant in conduct which intimidates, the complainant may make an APVO provided the Court views the conduct as of sufficient potency or seriousness as to warrant the making of an order (s 20(1)(b) of The Act). 21. “Intimidation” includes conduct amounting to harassment (s 7(1b) of The Act. “Harassment” means “to trouble by repeated attacks, to disturb persistently, to torment as with trouble or cares”, (Macquarie Dictionary Revised Third Edition). Clearly conduct may amount to intimidation even if it does not involve actual or threatened violence to the person (s 20(3)(b) of the Act). Indeed, this case presents text book examples of such intimidation. 22. In determining the Court’s approach to the making of an order I must consider the safety and protection of the complainant, any hardship that may be caused to either party by making or not making the order and any other relevant matters. If I determine to confirm the APVO made by the Local Court magistrate I just ensure the order imposes only those restrictions on the defendant that in my opinion are necessary for the safety and protection of the complainant (s 20 of the Act). That becomes important, as will be seen towards the end. 23. The complainant and defendant were both residents of a group of some seventy-plus residents in a Surry Hills Strata Plan known as Durham Village. Those residents were all part of the same strata title plan. The complainant’s case was that the defendant, in a continuing stream of publications, principally letters, mounted vitriolic and poisonous attacks upon him in circumstances where the defendant must have known that the publications would be seen by, or reckless as to whether they would be seen by the complainant. 24. The circulation of the publications followed one of three courses. One or two were directed to the complainant personally, or his agent/legal representative directly, for example, exhibit 22. Some were directed to the Owners Corporation or Executive Committee of what I can describe as the Durham Village Strata Title Plan of which the complainant was a member and would become aware of that correspondence by simply carrying out his duties as a member of the Executive Committee of the Corporation, or Committee, as the case may be, (see, for example, exhibit 21). The third area of distribution was to third parties such as Harvey’s Strata Title Management, the registrar of the CTTT, and third party owners of varying residences within Durham Village, or a mock-up newspaper attached to the Durham Village noticeboard. 25. The element of reckless, earlier referred to, attaches to the second and third courses of distribution. In respect of the second group, the recklessness verges towards a certainty that the complainant would see the correspondence. In respect of the third group, the recklessness is better described as a strong likelihood the complainant would see the correspondence.26. Did the publications, in content and/or frequency, constitute harassment? Of the twenty-three publications tendered in the original hearing, eighteen emanate from, and are the work of the defendant. Some, Exhibit 3, are relatively short, others are more than a page. For example, Exhibit 19B goes into a fourth page. (The exhibit numbers given are those before the magistrate). Some have annexures attached to which the defendant referred in his letters. I understand those eighteen publications are tendered as a sample of publications seen by the complainant over a three or four year period to March 2009. Contained in the publications are a series of allegations. Some replicated in other publications. Some allegations actually nominate the complainant, others do not nominate him, but impute or imply misconduct by a person who certainly fits the complainant. I tabulate below a number of allegations to be found in the publications: 
     
     Exhibit 1 (12/4/06). “I refer also to the well known stalking of myself in 2005 & 2006 by a mentally disturbed individual with seemingly unfettered access to the common area foyers of Durham Village and in constant telephonic stalking of my home, mobile and office phones. 
     
     
     Contempt of court by MD as duly authorised agent for... 
     
     
     MD’s recent well publicised threats to take the law into his own hands and break into yet another owner’s premises. 
     
     
     I have referred to the recent vandalising of my front door locks by the sadly deranged individual(s) who are stalking me by phone. 
     
     
     Exhibit 2 (18/7/06). Two 15+ year gay tenants have been harassed out of Durham Village recently by the all too well known actions of one individual. I have also been extensively stalked/harassed and had my common property, front door and car vandalised...the humiliating spectacle of one individual’s personality disorder and alcohol abuse issues. 
     
     
     Neither I nor my dog will be intimidated out of this building by a permanent personality disorder or alco abuse of anyone. 
     
     
     Exhibit 3. Would the Owners Corpn. now urgently confirm to we Owners that Mr MD (mortgagee in possession) debts of circa $7,800,000 in mortgages on his small APT.10 have not also been placed as mortgages on Durham Village. 
     
     
     Exhibit 4 (29/9/06). “For the information of my well known stalker I fax herewith some informative material on grandiose delusion-related psychosis. There are many owners in Durham Village very concerned for this individual’s increasingly well-known personal battles with many demons and financial woes”. Attached to that writing by the defendant was an annexure which was a pamphlet headed “Psychosis The Sane Guide”. 
     
     
     Exhibit 6 (17/10/06). “Re my ongoing harassment/gay discrimination by OC SP 20659 and its authorised agent MD. 
       
       [I] Am not surprised that the redoubtable MD (of the 7.8 million in mortgages) has delegated this sleazy task to Messrs Harvies…Harvies Licensee should be under no illusion that they are dealing with some alcohol-sozzled chronically unemployable dunderhead who lives off the earnings of a mail order bride and engaging in disputation with me.” 
       
     
     
     Exhibit 8 (19/10/06). “Re further vitriolic obscene homophobic abuse by Director MD.” 
     
     
     “I was too far removed to tell how highly intoxicated Mr MD was…police have advised me to keep safe distance with no AVO in place to protect me.” 
     
     
     “I was greatly shocked to hear from elderly grandmother of two young children…that a highly intoxicated Mr MD recently attended at her premises, followed a few steps behind by an elderly bawling male ‘Minder’ who helped him stay upright.” 
     
     
     “[the owner] received a veritable blizzard of over 50 or 60 letters from the said inebriated visitor thrust under her door until she had to engage a solicitor to stop the said harassment.” 
     
     
     Exhibit 11 (30/10/06). “I had the misfortune to encounter a Mr MD in an extremely intoxicated condition in the car park of Durham Village. After carefully checking there were no other witnesses around he proceeded to shout obscene homophobic abuse at my anti stalker companion canine and myself and then obscenely rubbed his hand and crotch in a masturbatory gesture.” 
     
     
     “These rancid attacks on long term owner…were compounded. I understand by Mr MD repeatedly leering over (the owners) adjoining neighbour’s fence…at [her] four year old grandchild home at the relevant time.” 
     
     
     “Mr MD’s close personal friend and fellow executive committee director was recently sprung peering through [the same owner] keyhole when her two very young grandchildren were at home.” 
     
     
     Exhibit 12 (2/11/06). “We Owners have now ascertained that Mr MD has circa 7,800,000.00 in duty stamped mortgages on his very run down apartment in Durham Village…” 
     
     
     Exhibit 14 (10/11/06). “Sexual harassment of gay residents by Chairman MD…” 
     
     
     “To my stalking(sic) over the past 12 months by a well known alcoholic with unfettered access to all common area foyers.” 
     
     
     Exhibit 15 (undated). “I have given OCS SP 20659 an opportunity to exonerate itself upon the overdue removal of MD (the second harassing CTTT application signed by MD must also be withdrawn by the OC and MD’s costs of gluing up my common property door locks in January be paid for by him of course.” 
     
     
     Exhibit 16 (undated). “Warning to all Durham Village residents and owners re rampant bullying of tenant and owners. 
       
       Add to the 2005 Body Corporate AGM you may have witnessed me being abused and bellowed at for three hours. Owner/Director’s meeting by former Chairman Mr MD the unsigned present chairman…”  
       
     
     
     “Resident caretaker/best mate of chairman got a 50 percent pay rise in a phoney stage managed non-transparent ‘tender’ process this year.” 
     
     
     Exhibit 17 (8307). MD...will bellow abuse at you at the OC’S AGM for 2-3 hours & the AGM minutes thereafter falsified on Christmas Eve by MD to conceal same. 
     An AVO will be taken out against you by MD by way of intimidation in the Local Court. 
     You will be stalked on your office/home/mobile phones constantly stopping only on occasions when MD is advised in writing via Harvies that Federal Authorities have placed traces on your incoming calls. 
       
        
       
     A highly intoxicated member of the executive committee will regularly scream at you in the car park “Fucken pooftah...I’m going to drive you outta here with my mates.” Whilst rubbing his crotch at the same time in a bizarre masturbatory gesture. 
       
        
       
     Your front door locks will be glued up on the last night of your annual holidays by someone with a red master key to all of Durham Village. 
     Exhibit 18(24/11/06). MD and his treasurer misled Owners on the attached papers by claiming that long overdue structural building works only cost the OC “$30,000”...in the budget 2006/07. When this representation was made to the owners in the general meeting both Chairman MD and Treasurer...had the attached tax invoice dated 16/9/06 from Remedial Building Services, total also attached (for $64,108). 
     Exhibit 19A(12/12/06). “The attached article on office bullies correctly sums up the entirety of MD’s conduct towards owners such as...,... and myself who refuse to be bullied or to pay obeisance to his narcissistic personality disorder. I also attach two relevant Herald articles on strata bullies which actually describes former Chairman MD as “On election they assume the role of a dictator deriding anyone who disagrees with them or their cronies and making sure everyone in the building knows they are top dog. They often have another agenda...be afraid, be very afraid” a truer word was never spoken of our OC. 
     19B(12/12/06). My...fellow resident MD (the unsigned regrettably my residence stalker also). 
     Psychologist also told me that MD also exhibits a bullying personality disorder known as narcissistic personality disorder aka anti-social personality disorder. 
     MD falsifies OC’s AGM minutes to remove votes of PJG as proxy and to advance and own vote to advance personal interest of fellow director... 
     MD uses Owners Trust funds to advance his personal attacks on PJG. 
     MD publishes defamatory letter to all Owners falsely alleging that PJG was Chairman at the time of the Great Hail Storm in April 1999 and that I protected incompetent Harvies Strata Managers... 
     MD puts on agenda ultra vires by-laws to remove PJG CORRO. from strata file then falsifies as SEC-Y the same AGM minutes and mails out same on Xmas Eve to conceal what he has done. 
     MD uses his master key to my common area foyer to glue up my common property front door locks then refused to pay $210 locksmith costs. Gloats over same with mate and OC resident, caretaker... 
     Exhibit 23. The date of exhibit 23 is not made clear but it presents as a Durham Village newsflash. The rest of its name is hidden by the exhibit tag in the Local Court. ChairHitler, MD and Lucky...take shot at.” Also on what may well be the front page, if it is a front page of a two page hand-up or pinup, “Where’s the missing $7.8 million and what did Markie do with it??” 
    27. Thereafter there appear some articles, if that is what they can be called, mock articles of a derogatory turn in which clearly the butt of the articles is the complainant.28. These publications as can be seen date from April 2006 through to April 2007. There is evidence which I accept that publications started before April 2006 and that they continued on after complaint was made in November 2006. The complainant also gave evidence that none of those allegations were true in fact. I am prepared to accept that that is so. Indeed, the proposition is not contested. The complainant puts the number of such communications he has seen up to 6 March 2009 as being in the hundred or so. Each constitutes an attack upon him, some more vitriolic than others. That they were made as a consequence of disputes arising from rights and privileges allowed within the strata title, is no excuse for their ferocity or inaccuracy. Indeed, they are deliberate inaccurate.29. I regard the conduct of the defendant in publishing these false assertions as deliberate in circumstances where he knew the complainant would be confronted by them, or was reckless as to whether the complainant would be confronted by them, as constituting conduct by him that amounts to intimidation, on the basis that it is conduct amounting to harassment of the complainant.30. The complainant gave evidence that he still fears that the defendant will engage in intimidatory conduct. Mr Hand for the defence accepted in submissions that may well be so. I am satisfied the complainant does hold this fear. He holds it on the basis of a long history of intimidatory conduct by the defendant. He holds it on the basis that there are still ongoing issues between the parties. I am satisfied he does hold such fears.31. Are there reasonable grounds for holding these fears? This is an issue which has presented some difficulty for me to determine, that is, whether the holding of the fears rests on reasonable grounds.Conduct of the Defendant Since 6/3/0932. Curran LCM was informed by the defendant that he had now moved to the Blue Mountains. He was also aware that the complainant had moved from Durham Village to a beachside area. Magistrate Curran described the parties as living “a long way from each other.” An argument was advanced by the defendant that there was no need for an order because all the issues between the parties were tied up in their dealings relating to the rights and privileges associated with the Durham Village strata title plan.33. Since the orders made by his Honour in the court below, there have been four communications by the defendant, either to the complainant personally or to his solicitors. Indeed there have been, I think, two communications by the complainant to the defendant. Although one of the defendant’s letters may be described as slightly odd, none of them is offensive. Indeed, each is business-like, save for one each is devoid of extravagant or florid language. The defence rely upon this correspondence ranging from 24 March 2009 through to 26 October 2009 as evidence supporting an argument there is an absence of reasonable grounds for the complainant to fear any pursuit of intimidating conduct by the defendant. 34. There are still outstanding matters which are awaiting resolution as a consequence of interaction between the parties during their years at Durham Village. As best I can tell, these may include costs arising from these proceedings, a complaint to the Law Society of New South Wales and a complaint to the office of the Legal Services Commission (see exhibit 1).35. The defendant is a qualified solicitor. The existence of an Apprehended Personal Violence Order against him must be a humiliation and embarrassment. Whether it is capable of prejudicing his employment opportunities is not a matter that has been addressed in evidence. Certainly any breach of the order may well be telling upon his prospects. The argument was advanced that his immediate past behaviour has been exemplary, indicative of a change in attitude. I accept that his immediate past behaviour is exemplary. Apart from the behaviour itself, I do not have any evidence as to what has caused it; that is why it has been exemplary. The most obvious answer to the question, and the inference I will draw, is that his behaviour has changed as a consequence of the order. 36. The only other evidence I have on the reasonableness of holding the fears is the long-term past behaviour. Past behaviour is recognised as one of the strongest predictors of future behaviour. In this case, the immediate past behaviour must also play a part, although, because of the existence of the Local Court’s order, the Local Court’s order will be given less weight. The standard of proof required is the balance of probabilities. I must say, if it was some higher standard, I would not have been satisfied. However, on the balances, I do find that the complainant has reasonable grounds to fear, at this time, the engagement in harassing conduct by the defendant.37. Finally, I must determine whether the intimidating conduct anticipated and feared by the complainant is conduct sufficient to warrant the making of an order. This exercise borders on the metaphysical. How does a tribunal determine whether feared conduct of a person that the tribunal has only seen in the witness box, and conduct yet to occur, if indeed it does occur, is conduct sufficient to warrant the making of an order?38. The matter has not been the subject of direct evidence - that is what conduct does he specifically fear? - but it is apparent the conduct feared is of a kind and quality as contained in the exhibits I have referred to, reflecting past conduct by the defendant; that is conduct amounting to harassment by means of vitriolic allegations contained in publications written in an extravagant style, published knowingly or recklessly so that the complainant will become aware of their contents. It is upon this basis I find the feared conduct is sufficient to warrant a continuation of the orders made. 39. Thus I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the complainant has reasonable grounds to fear, and in fact fears, the engagement of the defendant in conduct that would intimidate the complainant, which is conduct sufficient to warrant the making of orders.40. The learned magistrate chose a two-year period as the proper duration of the order, on the basis of ongoing issues that should be resolved within that time span. Eight months of that two years has now expired. I am content to confirm the two year period and its commencement date on 6 March 2005.41. There are, however, two orders imposed by the learned magistrate that now seem to me to be otiose; namely an order that the defendant not post any material on the Durham Village notice board of the Owners’ Corporation. It seems to me such an order has no meaning as neither person frequents, and quite possibly many of the people now there do not know the parties. And, secondly, the defendant must not distribute personal or financial information about the complainant to the other residents of Durham Village. I see no reason why those orders should be maintained and I intend to delete them. 42. Subject to that, my formal orders are that the mandatory orders, so called A, B and C, made by the learned magistrate be confirmed. I make an order that the defendant pay the complainant’s costs as assessed or otherwise agreed. Is there any other order I need to make?ENGLAND: May I ask your Honour to affirm the costs order made by the magistrate below on 6 March 2009?HIS HONOUR: Have those costs not been paid?ENGLAND: No, not yet.HIS HONOUR: Yes, well I confirm the orders.ENGLAND: Thank you, your Honour.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: The applicant seeks leave to appeal under cl 8(1)(a) of schedule 1 to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”) against a decision by Grove J of 6 March 2008 refusing an application brought by the applicant pursuant to Schedule 1 of the Act for a redetermination of the life sentence his Honour imposed on 10 August 1990 after a jury found the applicant guilty of the murder of Bruce Mannion. 2 Although his Honour declined to set a determinate sentence he did set a non-parole period of 22 years in respect of the life sentence pursuant to cl 4(1)(b) of Schedule 1 of the Act. The non-parole period is due to expire on 27 July 2010 at which time the applicant is eligible to be considered for release to parole. The application for leave to appeal is solely in relation to his Honours refusal to set a determinate sentence. 3 The applicant was represented in the proceedings before his Honour. He appears on his own behalf in this Court. It would appear that the Notice of Appeal and the Grounds of Appeal were prepared without legal assistance. The filed grounds of appeal contend that his Honour was led into error by the Crown, and by reason of the incompetence of his own counsel, as to the facts upon which the murder conviction was based. In summary, the applicant contended that he was wrongly convicted of the murder and that the conviction and the life sentence imposed following his conviction in 1990 constituted a miscarriage of justice. For this reason he submitted that the life sentence should have been redetermined and that his Honour was in error in not doing so. 4 To the extent that the application for leave to appeal seeks to challenge the conviction against which the life sentence was imposed it is misconceived. Despite the fact that his Honour was obliged by cl 3 of the Schedule to have regard to all the circumstances surrounding the offence, in order, inter alia, to consider the need to preserve the safety of the community as provided for in cl 7, it formed no part of his Honour’s function to enquire into the circumstances of the offence for the purpose of revisiting the question of guilt. By cl 8 of the Schedule, the appeal to this Court is restricted to exposing error in his Honour’s determination of the application brought by the applicant under cl 4(1) of the Schedule.  
     
      
    The history of the proceedings following conviction 5 At the time of the original sentence proceedings s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 (since repealed) required the imposition of a life sentence following a conviction for murder save where the offender’s culpability was shown to be significantly diminished. At the time of sentence his Honour was satisfied that there was no medical evidence probative of the applicant suffering from a psychiatric condition, and no other evidence justifying a departure from the mandatory terms of s 19A. His Honour did, however, recommend that a psychiatric assessment of the applicant be undertaken by the prison authorities. 6 On 14 February 1994, this Court heard an appeal against the applicant‘s conviction and an application for leave to appeal against sentence. The appeal against conviction and the application for leave to appeal were dismissed: R v Kluska (Court of Criminal Appeal, 14 February 1994, unreported). 
     
      
    7 On 27 November 1998, Grove J heard an application brought by the applicant under s 13A of the Sentencing Act 1989 (since repealed) for a redetermination of the life sentence. At that time the applicant had served 10 years and 5 months in custody but was classified as a forensic patient and detained in a prison hospital.  
     
      
    8 Under s 13A(8B) of the Sentencing Act his Honour had power to redetermine the sentence and to set a minimum and additional term, or to decline to do so. In addition, his Honour had the power to direct that the applicant not re-apply for a further redetermination of sentence for at least three years if satisfied that the murder met the classification of a most serious case and that it was in the public interest that there be no application for a redetermination before the expiration of that three year period. His Honour dismissed the application and directed that there be no further application for redetermination of the life sentence for a period of three years: R v Kluska (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Grove J, 18 November 1998, unreported).  
     
      
    9 On 18 July 2001 this Court dismissed an application for leave to appeal from his Honour’s decision (see R v Kluska [2001] NSWCCA 284).  
     
      
    10 In exercising the power under s 13A of the Sentencing Act his Honour was obliged to have regard to the views of the Serious Offenders Review Council constituted by s 195 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999. That body reported generally on the difficulties that the prison authorities had experienced in managing the applicant after he was classified as a forensic patient under the Mental Health Act 1990 some 18 months earlier (the details of which will be outlined shortly). His Honour also noted that the applicant’s then treating psychiatrist, Dr Wilcox, was confronted with what she described as a practical dilemma in so far as the applicant’s future treatment was concerned due to the fact that the success of that treatment, and in turn the applicant’s rehabilitative prospects, depended upon his compliance with a pharmacological regime of antipsychotic medication to address his psychiatric illness. Dr Wilcox reported that the applicant did not believe he needed medication and that he was compliant with the regime only with a view to maintaining his classification as a forensic patient for his own reasons fully appreciating that because of that classification he could be forced to take the prescribed medication. In these circumstances, and with an apprehension that should the applicant stop taking the medication there was a real risk that his offending behaviour would recur, his Honour was not persuaded that the application for redetermination should be granted. His Honour was conscious that while the law does not permit preventative detention, he was also firmly of the view that any proportionate sentence that might be imposed for the murder would well exceed the time the applicant had already served in custody, together with the additional three years before a further application for redetermination could be made in accordance with his direction.  
     
      
    The applicant's psychiatric history within the prison system 
     
      
    11 It would seem that the applicant was first admitted to the Long Bay Prison Hospital Complex in 1994 with what was described as “a psychotic illness”. At this time the applicant reported to his treating psychiatrists the belief that: 
     
      
       
        
        “..four years earlier, during a hernia operation, doctors had deliberately occluded his left vas deferens, which he believed resulted in prostatic swelling and kidney damage. He believed that the doctors inflicted this on him in order to force him to restrict his water intake to the point where delirium would supervene and he would confess his guilt in relation to the crime.” 
        
       
      
    12 During the first three week admission to hospital in 1994 his treating psychiatrist noted that the applicant remained without insight into his condition, that he was hostile to any suggestion he might have an illness requiring treatment and, after accepting antipsychotic medication for a short time, refused all further medication. He was readmitted to the Long Bay Prison Hospital Complex approximately two months later during which time it was noted that he was floridly psychotic with multiple persecutory and somatic delusions. He was at that time commenced on antipsychotic medication by depot injections. On discharge from hospital he was non-compliant with medication with an exacerbation of his delusions leading to threats of violence.13 On 28 July 1997, after further non-compliance with his medication, the applicant was transferred to a hospital pursuant to s 97(1) of the Mental Health Act the Chief Health Officer having received certification from Drs O’Dea and Wilcox that the applicant was a mentally ill person as defined under the Act. He was at that time diagnosed with a delusional disorder manifested by psychosis with multiple persecutory and somatic delusions and an antisocial personality disorder. (I note that in other reports the diagnosis at this time has been identified as a severe paranoid schizophrenic illness which remains his current diagnosis subject to the illness now being described as chronic.) During the admission in 1997 it was noted that the applicant believed there was a conspiracy to kill him involving doctors and nurses and prison officers and, in particular, that he was convinced that the treating psychiatrists were hiding in neighbouring toilets while he was defecating and that they were talking to him telling him he would suffer until he told them where the deceased’s body could be found. He was recommenced on antipsychotic intravenous medication. He has remained hospitalised within the prison system as a forensic patient for extended intervals since that time. 14 On 29 November 2000 the applicant was transferred to Long Bay Hospital as a psychiatric patient and was thereafter transferred to the Metropolitan Medical Transient Centre following a recommendation from the Mental Health Review Tribunal. From that time the applicant has on occasions refused to attend on psychiatrists for the purposes of the preparation of psychiatric reports or to participate in case management training processes on the basis of his vehement disagreement with his diagnosis of mental illness. At other times, after submitting to medication administered either orally or by depot injection, he has acknowledged and accepted his responsibility for the murder and appears to have welcomed the assistance medical staff have provided for him. His progress however, has been variable with admissions to the Long Bay Prison Hospital complex in 2004 with increasing persecutory delusions, abusiveness and threats of aggression. At the time of the application before his Honour, and at the time of the hearing before this Court, he was an inmate at the Junee Correctional Centre where it would appear his condition was being adequately managed despite the fact that in Dr O’Dea’s opinion he continues to have limited insight into his psychiatric condition and his psychiatric treatment needs. This was amply demonstrated in the course of his appearance in the proceedings before this Court. 
     
      
    15 On 15th February 2008 Dr O’Dea interviewed the applicant at the request of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to the then pending application for redetermination before Grove J scheduled for 22 February 2008 and provided a comprehensive report, which was tendered in the proceedings. In that report the applicant maintained his innocence and expressed a determination to prove his innocence, inclusive of offering his body to science, once he was released in order that his subconscious might be accessed.  
     
      
    The application before Grove J 
     
      
    16 On the application for redetermination before Grove J from which the present application is brought, the applicant again sought orders that a specified term for the sentence be set together with a non-parole period. At the time of the application he had served almost 20 years imprisonment. The applicant’s case was supported by two affidavits, one from his solicitor and one from an educational officer, which referred generally to his pursuit of religious and vocational studies whilst in custody. It was submitted on his behalf that the circumstances of the offence as revealed by the tender of agreed facts, together with the sentence imposed viewed in the context of relevant statistics, including sentences imposed by reference to the standard non-parole period of 20 years for murder, a non-parole period of more 25 years could not be justified.  
     
      
    17 The Crown submitted that his Honour should decline to set a non-parole period for the sentence since the murder was properly described as within the category of worst case. The Crown also sought a direction pursuant to cl 6(1)(a) of the Schedule to the Act that the applicant not be permitted to re-apply to the Court for redetermination of his sentence. 
     
      
    The judgment under appeal 
     
      
    18 In his judgment Grove J referred to the agreed statement of facts and extracted the material matters bearing upon the commission of the offence at paragraph 6 of the judgment in accordance with the requirement under cl 3(1) of the Schedule to the Act to have regard to all of the circumstances surrounding the offence for which the sentence was imposed.  
     
      
    19 In summary, the facts detail the relationship between the applicant and the deceased through their mutual involvement with the Anglican community at Dubbo following the applicant's release from custody to parole in 1987 after serving sentences for kidnapping, armed robbery, escape from lawful custody and being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence. The deceased owned a yellow Holden sedan and a Kawasaki motorcycle. He was last seen alive in the applicant's company at about 9:30pm on 20 July 1988 at which time the applicant was heard to ask the deceased whether he was ready to go home. The deceased failed to attend work the following day and when he did not arrive at his parents’ home in Sydney by arrangement on the evening of 22 July 1988 his father reported him missing to police. The applicant was seen in Dubbo on 21 July in the deceased's yellow sedan and riding the deceased’s motorcycle. In another vehicle to which the deceased had access also in the applicant's possession after his disappearance police located a forged letter of resignation in the deceased's name. On 22 July the applicant, using the deceased's name, booked into a Sydney hotel with two young women. During the course of that day he withdrew $2000 from the deceased's bank account. This was the first of the number of transactions on that account. He also removed property from the deceased's home.  
     
      
    20 The agreed facts note that the applicant admitted assuming the deceased's identity, utilising his vehicles and his bank accounts for his own purposes and signing the purported letter of resignation when arrested but denied any responsibility for the disappearance and murder of the deceased. 
     
      
    21 His Honour referred extensively to the report of Dr O’Dea and concluded that he would have serious concerns about the risk which the applicant would present to the community were he to cease his medication.  
     
      
    22 Grove J observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “11 Even as recently as to Dr O’Dea in February this year, the applicant spoke of the time “once he has been acquitted of the murder”. As I have said previously, the proof of guilt was overwhelming but I cannot determine whether these protestations are aspects of the applicant’s mental condition or are false postures which he is deliberately presenting. Over the years the applicant has from time to time confessed his guilt and then recanted his confession. Bruce Mannion’s body has never been located. On one occasion when a confession by the applicant was “current” he took police to bushland in the Gnoo State Forest and indicated an area which was extensively cleared and excavated but no trace of Mr Mannion’s body was found.  
        12 Inter alia, the applicant has written to the then Commissioner of Police seeking to provoke missing persons action in relation to the deceased. He has also at times asserted that Bruce Mannion has in fact been found and buried in a cemetery plot in Sydney. To my observation Mr Mannion’s mother has attended the trial in 1990, the hearing in 1998 and the hearing of this application. I am informed that she is now eighty years of age. In the years that have passed since their son’s murder, Mr Mannion’s father has died but he has three surviving brothers. It is plain that the hope of Bruce Mannion’s family that his body might be found is dependent upon relevant information being forthcoming from the applicant. It is impossible for me to know the extent to which the applicant’s mental illness contributes to his unwillingness to locate it.  
        13 The applicant’s behaviour whilst in custody has not been good and there is a schedule in evidence setting out numerous disciplinary charges, but I note that misbehaviour seems to have ceased several years ago and the applicant is said to be calmer. He has engaged himself in some intensive bible study. I am satisfied that the compulsion to take medication has significantly contributed to stabilizing his situation.  
        14 The evidence also includes a series of reports from the Serious Offenders Review Council, the latest of which is dated 17 July 2007. It contains no express recommendation concerning this application but notes that classification will be reviewed in the light of whatever decision is made.” 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour discussed the distinction at common law between extending a sentence merely to protect society and properly looking to the protection of society in the determination of sentence. His Honour then noted that in considering the application for both the redetermination of the life sentence and the fixing of a non-parole period that regard be had to the need to preserve the safety of the community. His Honour concluded that: 
     
      
       
        
        “25 I would assess the risk posed by the applicant to the community as high. In reaching that conclusion I have taken into account his considerable prior record of serious offending, his record of violent outbursts from time to time whilst in custody, his mental condition which is stable to the extent it is by reason of the ability for him to be compelled to continue medication, and to the risks inherent in his apparently unpredictable changes in recognition of his responsibility for killing.  
        26 In the whole of the circumstances I decline to set a determinate sentence.  
        27 However, there is a third alternative and that is, pursuant to clause 4(1)(b) to set a non-parole period without altering the existing life sentence. That is an approach which is not available where an offender appears for sentence at first instance, as it were, and is exclusively available in these statutory proceedings. This application is to be determined in accordance with the statute and is therefore distinguishable from a conventional imposition of sentence following conviction. The principles to be applied are set out in the Schedule.  
        28 Taking into account the matters to which I am required to have regard, I conclude that I should decline to set a specified term but should set a non-parole period. The final issue is the length of that non-parole period. It is to be emphasized that expiry of a non-parole period does not mean that the applicant will be released, it simply sets a point of time at which eligibility occurs. Actual release, if it is to occur, will require further decision at the time when it is contemplated and statutory provisions as to parole require, among other things, a determination about the danger which a person, if paroled, might then represent to the community.  
        29 The applicant has been in custody continuously for over nineteen years. The non-parole period should represent the minimum time during which custody should continue. Some guidance can be extracted from sentencing patterns, including the average time prior to release on licence abovementioned, but the individuality of the applicant’s offence, its circumstances and his antecedents are set out in the accumulated material which I will not further summarize. I assess an appropriate non-parole period at twenty two years.” 
        
       
      
    The applicant’s case in this Court 
     
      
    24 Very extensive written material was filed in support of the application. On close reading much of the material seeks to mount a challenge to the murder conviction both as to the sufficiency of evidence to support it, the conduct of the investigating police in assembling it, the prison authorities in tampering with evidence he was to rely on in his defence at trial and the Crown in presenting its case in the absence of a body or a murder weapon. He also complained about his lawyers who have from time to time failed to follow his instructions.  
     
      
    25 At the hearing the applicant confirmed that he understood that the hearing before Grove J proceeded on a set of agreed facts. In oral submissions the applicant claimed that he had been made a mentally ill person by Grove J who had: 
     
      
       
        
        “…ordered prison authorities to do a medical experiment on me which they did by putting a blockage in my left vas deferens and it’s been there for over 18 years and I’ve been in pain and agony and been refused pain killers for all that time and I’ve been told constantly it’s going to stay there until I either become uremic or confess to the crime and I have no knowledge because I have always declared I was never there at the scene of the crime and I put this submission that the reasons why I’ve been made mentally ill is because I wrote to members of Parliament to have those criminal acts that were performed on me investigated and because of that I was made a forensic patient in order to shut me up.” 
        
       
      
    26 The applicant also complained that Grove J was punishing him for not confessing to a crime, which he believed the applicant had committed. The applicant insisted that he did not murder the deceased and that he was not mentally ill. He complained that he was being tortured and tormented into believing, or accepting the Crown’s evidence against him and to confess to the murder. The applicant also complained of being forced to take psychotropic drugs for an illness which he did not have.  
     
      
    The applicant’s case was not established 
     
      
    27 After reviewing the evidence tendered before his Honour, in particular the agreed facts and the comprehensive report furnished by Dr O’Dea, we can detect no error in his Honour’s reasons for declining to fix a determinate sentence. His Honour had proper regard to the matters specified in the Schedule by reference to the evidence before him and concluded, as was open to him, that the risk which the applicant posed to the community was high having regard to his considerable prior record, his record of violent outbursts while in custody, his mental illness, albeit rendered stable by medication, and his apparently unpredictable changes in attitude towards his responsibility for the murder. 
     
      
    28 In fixing a non-parole period, Grove J had regard to the fact that the applicant had been in custody continuously for over 19 years. His Honour assessed that in all of the circumstances, the appropriate non-parole period was 22 years. There is no challenge to that finding in any event. 
     
      
    29 Accordingly, the orders are as follows: 
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal is granted. 
       
      2. The appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The Court Court is in a position to deliver judgment. I will ask Johnson J to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Mohamed Jalloh, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the Sydney District Court on 23 July 2009 with respect to two counts of indecent assault. The maximum penalty for each offence was imprisonment for five years: s.61L Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    3 Upon the first count, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 12 months to commence on 21 September 2008, to expire on 20 September 2009 with a balance of term of 18 months to expire on 20 March 2011. On the second count, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 12 months to commence on 21 March 2009 and to expire on 20 March 2010, with a balance of term of 18 months to expire on 20 September 2011.  
     
      
    4 The total effective sentence comprised a head sentence of three years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months ending on 20 March 2010.  
     
      
       
      Facts of Offences 
       
      
    5 An agreed statement of facts was tendered in the District Court and the sentencing Judge made findings in accordance with the agreed facts. 
     
      
    6 In the early hours of Friday, 19 June 2008, the victim, a young woman, went with a male companion to the Oxford Hotel, Surry Hills about 4.15 am. She had something to drink before going to the hotel and was feeling reasonably intoxicated.  
     
      
    7 At 4.41 am, the victim and her male companion went to the men’s toilet in the basement of the Oxford Hotel. The male companion went to the toilet and the victim entered one of the toilet cubicles because she felt ill. She sat on the floor of the cubicle and was sick in the toilet bowl. She then lost consciousness. After some time, the victim became aware of the Applicant looking around the door of the cubicle. The victim had never seen the Applicant before. 
     
      
    8 The Applicant asked if she was alright, but the victim could not speak or move. The Applicant entered the cubicle and sat behind the victim.  
     
      
    9 The victim lapsed in and out of consciousness. At one point, she woke to find that the Applicant had his hand up her t-shirt, under her bra and was fondling her breasts (Count 1). The victim pushed the Applicant’s hand away, but was not able to speak. She then lost consciousness again.  
     
      
    10 On another occasion, the victim awoke to find that the Applicant had his hand down her trousers, inside her underpants and was touching her on the outside of her vulva (Count 2).  
     
      
    11 During the assaults, the Applicant was talking to the victim. He asked her to come back to his house and offered to take care of her. The victim was unable to stand or speak properly, but she shook her head and said “No”.  
     
      
    12 At about 6.40 am, the victim woke up and felt better. The Applicant was still in the cubicle with her. She got up and left the men’s toilet and washed her face in the women’s toilet. The Applicant was waiting for her on the landing outside the women’s toilet. He followed her as she left the hotel, and again asked her to go back to his house. She told him to leave her alone. The Applicant eventually walked away and the victim found her car. She drove to a friend’s place and told her of the assaults. A few hours later, the victim attended Redfern Police Station and gave a statement. She then attended the Sexual Assault Clinic at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, where she was examined.  
     
      
    13 Toxicology results on the victim’s blood samples tested positive for the presence of amphetamines. The sentencing Judge observed that it was a matter of complete conjecture as to how this drug got into the victim’s system. His Honour observed, however, that it was not suggested that the Applicant had anything had to do with this, and that the presence of the drug may serve to explain the victim’s difficulty in remaining conscious over the period of time when she was in the presence of the Applicant. 
     
      
    14 The victim was shown a photo array by police and identified the Applicant. CCTV footage from the Oxford Hotel established that the victim entered the men’s toilet at 4.41 am, the Applicant entered the men’s toilet at 5.00 am and they both left the toilet at 6.41 am. 
     
      
    15 At about 4.20 pm on Friday, 19 June 2008, police observed the Applicant walking along Flinders Street, Surry Hills. He was wearing the same clothes as he had been wearing earlier at the Oxford Hotel. Police arrested the Applicant. Swabs of his hand were taken, which tested positive for the victim’s DNA. The Applicant participated in an ERISP in which he initially admitted to being in the toilet of the hotel, and then denied being at the hotel at the relevant time. 
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s Subjective Circumstances 
       
      
    16 The Applicant was born in 1985. He was 22 years old at the time of the offences and 23 years old at the time of sentence.  
     
      
    17 The Applicant has had what the sentencing Judge described, accurately, as a “singularly unfortunate history” (ROS3). Born in Sierra Leone, the Applicant and an elder brother were the only survivors of a massacre during a raid by rebel forces which killed the Applicant’s parents and his other seven siblings. The Applicant was seven years old at the time of this tragedy. He escaped by leaping through a window and running off into the bush. He came into contact with other members of his village and, in their company, he travelled to Guinea, where he lived for some time. Eventually, his elder brother, who had previously understood the Applicant to have been killed, discovered that he was alive. He came to that part of Guinea in which the Applicant was living with his former neighbours and took control of him. The Applicant and his elder brother eventually came to Australia in 2003 as refugees, initially living in Tasmania.  
     
      
    18 Evidence was given at the sentencing hearing by Ms Anne Hughes, a social worker, who had significant contact with the Applicant in Tasmania. The sentencing Judge adverted to the evidence of Ms Hughes concerning the Applicant’s education, employment and social difficulties. Ms Hughes gave evidence of her work with the Applicant in Hobart at the Phoenix Centre, a small specialist centre for survivors of torture and trauma. Ms Hughes had direct contact with the Applicant in Hobart and phone contact with him after he had, against her advice, moved on his own to Sydney. Ms Hughes had described odd behaviour on the part of the Applicant in her dealings with him. The Applicant’s elder brother continues to live in Victoria. 
     
      
    19 Also in evidence in the District Court were reports of Dr Peter Champion, psychologist, and Dr Susan Pulman, clinical and forensic neuropsychologist. The sentencing Judge had regard to these reports in his remarks on sentence, noting that the Applicant’s overall level of intellectual functioning fell within the extremely low range at the 0.3 percentile, thereby satisfying the criteria of mild intellectual disability. 
     
      
    20 The Applicant has a criminal history in this State since 2005 for summary offences including stealing, goods in custody, entering enclosed lands, and possession of prohibited drugs, all of which were dealt with by way of fines between September 2005 and November 2007. On 20 August 2008, the Applicant was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment (to date from 6 July 2008) for an offence of stealing from the person, and was placed on a 12-month bond for damaging property with no additional penalty being imposed for a further offence of possession of a prohibited drug.  
     
      
    21 The Applicant was on bail for the lastmentioned offences at the time of the commission of the present offences on 19 June 2008. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal - The Sentences Were Manifestly Excessive 
       
      
    22 A single ground of appeal is relied upon by the Applicant contending that, in the exceptional subjective circumstances of this case, the sentences are manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    23 Mr Button SC, for the Applicant, submitted that the subjective circumstances of this case were compelling, so that a finding ought be made that the sentences were manifestly excessive, with this Court intervening to resentence the Applicant so as to permit his immediate release from custody. 
     
      
    24 Mr Button SC emphasised the tragic history of the Applicant in Africa prior to his arrival as a refugee in Australia. Reference was made to the evidence of Ms Hughes concerning her dealings with the Applicant.  
     
      
    25 It was submitted that the Applicant was attracted to Sydney and had travelled here on his own. By the time of the present offences, it was submitted that he was living on the streets of Kings Cross and on trains and that, unsurprisingly, he had amassed a somewhat lengthy criminal record, although not one of great seriousness. 
     
      
    26 Reference was made to the psychological assessment of the Applicant as having a mild intellectual disability. Since the Applicant had been in custody since 20 June 2008, he had been assaulted in prison on four occasions and, at the time of sentence in the District Court, he was on protection.  
     
      
    27 Mr Button SC submitted that there could be no complaint about the sentences, were it not for the highly unusual subjective circumstances of the Applicant. It was accepted that a prison sentence of some sort was within the sentencing Judge’s discretion. It was submitted, however, that the combination of intellectual disability, mental and emotional disturbance, social isolation, lack of prior serious matters, and the terrible life story of the Applicant meant that, in these most peculiar circumstances, these sentences are too severe. It was submitted that this Court should intervene and resentence the Applicant with the result that he be released today. 
     
      
    28 In oral submissions, Mr Button SC raised, in support of the single ground of appeal, the possibility that these matters might have been disposed of summarily in the Local Court. 
     
      
    29 The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge had dealt comprehensively with the Applicant’s subjective circumstances, referring expressly to the Applicant’s history in Africa and the psychological evidence of Mr Champion and Dr Pulman concerning the Applicant’s mental disability. The Crown submitted that his Honour had regard to the Applicant’s mild intellectual disability, which reduced the significance of general deterrence, whilst also recognising the countervailing need to ensure community protection, particularly in light of the Applicant’s criminal history. The Crown emphasised the need to impose sentences that reflected the objective gravity of the offences, which involved the indecent assault of a woman who was clearly unable to protect herself from the Applicant’s purposeful and persistent conduct over a period of some two hours. It was submitted that the touching of the victim inside her underwear made these serious examples of offences of this type. Further, it was an aggravating factor that the offences were committed whilst the Applicant was at liberty on bail for offences of stealing from the person and possess prohibited drug. 
     
      
    30 The Crown submitted that the Applicant had pleaded guilty at a relatively late stage and a discount in the order of 15% was allowed in this respect. There was no evidence of remorse and the Applicant did not have the benefit of prior good character. The Crown submitted that his Honour had regard to the Applicant’s protective custody and had varied the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and head sentence. The Crown submitted that it had not been demonstrated that the sentences passed lay outside the range of the proper exercise of sentencing discretion, and that the Applicant had failed to demonstrate that the sentences were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    31 The Applicant does not contend that the sentencing Judge made any error of law or fact. Nor is it said that the sentencing Judge had regard to irrelevant factors or failed to have regard to matters relevant to sentence. The real question to be determined is whether the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25].  
     
      
    32 There is no single correct sentence, and Judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies: Markarian v The Queen at 371 [27].  
     
      
    33 There is no doubt that the Applicant had a strong subjective case. His tragic family history and other subjective features, including his mild intellectual disability, could be called in aid on sentence. The sentencing Judge considered in detail the Applicant’s subjective circumstances.  
     
      
    34 His Honour observed that the case involved “difficult balancing exercises” (ROS7). In weighing up factors relevant to sentence, his Honour observed that “Whilst one has considerable sympathy for Mr Jalloh because of his intellectual capacity, his emotional condition and his devastatingly tragic background, the victim in these offences was a woman in an extremely vulnerable condition” (ROS6-7). The victim was lapsing in and out of consciousness, having been sick and was unable to stand or speak, with his Honour observing that “It is difficult to imagine somebody less able to protect themselves against the assaults of an opportunistic criminal such as the offender represented himself on this occasion” (ROS7). 
     
      
    35 No challenge is made to the finding of the sentencing Judge that the offences lay in the mid-range of objective seriousness because of the extreme vulnerability of the victim, and because they involve fondling inside her underwear by a total stranger who took advantage of her condition. Nor is it contended that his Honour fell into error in fact or law in partially accumulating the sentences. 
     
      
    36 I do not think that the Applicant is assisted by the theoretical possibility that these matters might have been dealt with summarily. These matters were of a level of seriousness that disposal on indictment was entirely appropriate. These are not Local Court offences being dealt with in the District Court: R v Gent (2005) 162 A Crim R 29 at 45-48 [76]-[91]; Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [47]-[49]. 
     
      
    37 The present offences were committed upon a vulnerable victim. Each offence involved significant intrusion, with the Applicant placing his hand under clothing. The offences were committed whilst the Applicant was subject to conditional liberty. 
     
      
    38 The sentences imposed must ultimately reflect the objective seriousness of the offences committed, and there must be a reasonable proportionality between the sentences passed and the circumstances of the crime committed: s.3A(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152 at [15].  
     
      
    39 The relative importance of the objective facts and subjective features will vary from case to case. However, it is necessary to guard against a risk that attention to persuasive subjective considerations does not cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective circumstances of the case: R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594; R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. 
     
      
    40 This Court is a court of error. The question to be determined is not what sentences this Court would pass if sitting at first instance in this case. Rather, the question is whether the Applicant has demonstrated that the sentences in this case were unreasonable or plainly unjust, so as to be manifestly excessive. I am not persuaded that the Applicant has made good that ground in this case. 
     
      
    41 The sentencing Judge directed the Applicant’s release on parole on 20 March 2010, with his Honour noting that the Probation and Parole Service ought ensure that the Applicant receives psychological therapy to assist with his symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and ought enrol him in an appropriate literacy program designed for individuals with mild intellectual disability (ROS8-9). Parole conditions of this type appear especially appropriate for this Applicant. 
     
      
    42 I would grant the Applicant leave to appeal, but would dismiss the appeal with respect to sentence. 
     
      
    43 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J. 
     
      
    44 HIDDEN J: I also agree, although only after anxious consideration. The Applicant's subjective case was powerful and unusual. Nevertheless, these offences were grave offences of their kind, given the distressing and frankly, sordid circumstances in which they were committed. Mr Button SC did raise in oral argument the appropriateness of the measure of accumulation to which his Honour had resort. In my view, it would have been open to his Honour to have made the sentences wholly concurrent, but I cannot say he erred in his discretion in accumulating in the manner he did. In those circumstances, I agree for the reasons given by Johnson J that no error has been shown warranting the intervention of this Court. 
     
      
    45 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The orders of the Court will be those proposed by Johnson J.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Unus Hendricks pleaded guilty to an offence of armed robbery committed on 24 April 2009. On that day, the offender had been out drinking with some family members. He became intoxicated to the extent that he was asked to leave the premises where he had been drinking. As he was heading off, he took a spur of the moment decision to commit a very serious crime. He came across a damaged golf club, picked it up, and took it into the bottle shop at the East Hills Cellars. He went into the shop, raised the golf club into the air, and smashed it down on the counter a number of times. He said to the shop attended “Till, till”, and gestured towards the cash register. The shop attendant did not cooperate, probably because of the nature of the weapon (something I will discuss later). The shop attendant said “You will not get the money”, which caused the offender to once again smash the golf club on the counter, but this time he shattered the top of the glass counter and broke the head of the golf club. 2 There was a customer nearby purchasing a four-litre cask of wine. The shop attendant threw that cask at the offender and then picked up a hammer that was under the counter and held it raised up. On seeing this, the offender virtually gave in. He grabbed a few packets of cigarettes and ran away. 3 This offence was always going to be detected. The offender made no efforts to disguise himself and left behind the golf club handle and, most importantly, his fingerprints located on the cigarette shelves. The offender already had a criminal history and so his fingerprints were known to police. He was arrested on 7 May and has remained in custody since that date. 4 The offender was born to parents of South African origin. His parents separated when he was about ten, and the offender told a psychologist that before then he was subject to some violence at the hands of his father. His father would become drunk and be belligerent. He did reasonably well at school, however, and has a very positive relationship with his mother, who gave evidence before me today. He also has a positive relationship with his siblings. He did not finish high school, but left after gaining a School Certificate part way through year 11, in order to focus on getting a job. He was successful in doing it. Many in the area in which he was brought up are unemployed, but Mr Hendricks was not one of those. He had a number of jobs before getting one which he quite enjoyed, doing general warehouse duties for a printing firm. He was very happy with himself, and proud of what he had achieved. However, he lost that job, apparently because he did not have a forklift licence. He says in a letter addressed to me that this was “the day my life turned upside down”. He began drinking much more than he had, to the extent that he developed a reasonable problem with alcohol. He has also used drugs over the years. 5 The offender has a criminal history too, an offence of robbery committed whilst a juvenile, and, in 2007, a number of offences, which led to a s 9 bond and some fines. This is, however, the most serious offence that the offender has ever committed, and it is necessary that a substantial period of imprisonment is imposed. 6 Of course, the offender’s case today fits almost exactly into the usual case postulated in the guideline judgment of R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, with one major difference, and that concerns the fact that in Henry the four to five year range was for a plea of guilty of limited utility. In this case, the offender pleaded guilty at an early stage. 7 I mentioned the weapon that the offender used. Most armed robberies involve weapons easily capable of having fatal results, such as a knife or a gun. Part of the terror which is felt by the victims of such robberies is no doubt due to those victims recognising that there is a real risk of death by having a gun pointing at them, or a violent criminal armed with a knife robbing them. Victims of armed robberies report, almost universally, significant consequences of those offences. Here, the offender, on the spur of the moment, picked up a golf club. It is a weapon much less likely to be fatal than a gun or a knife. That is another factor pointing in the offender’s favour when compared to the Henry guideline judgment. 8 There is no doubt that the offender is capable of being a productive member of society. He has a good work ethic, regarding his time in employment with some fondness. He has substantial family support. Not only his mother, but other family members are present in court today. Indeed, one of his brothers-in-law has offered him part-time employment doing some waterproofing work upon his release from custody to tide him over until he finds full-time work. 9 The offender expressed his remorse for what he had done, recognising the impact of his offence on the shopkeeper and the other customer, as well, and perhaps more importantly, as the effect of what he had done upon his family.10 The offender does have good prospects of rehabilitation, although no doubt the Probation and Parole Service can assist him in that regard by recommending courses and supervising him whilst on parole. There are special circumstances in this case because of the benefit that the offender will gain from such supervision and courses. If he is assisted through the Probation and Parole Service to rehabilitate himself, then not only will the offender benefit, but the community will as well. 11 It is sometimes a depressing job sitting up here as a judge dealing with offenders who really are most likely to re-offend at an early stage of their release from custody, but I consider that this offender has, with the support of his family and the Probation and Parole Service, a very good chance to put this offending behind him. He is articulate, he is clever, and he wishes to do something with his life, in contrast to many other offenders dealt with by the courts. There is thus a great deal of hope for the offender’s future. Despite that, of course, he has to be punished for what he has done. 12 The guideline judgment of Henry was a response to community concern about the prevalence of armed robbery and the sentences imposed for it. For the reasons I have articulated, however, the sentence that I will impose is lower than the range suggested in the Henry guideline judgment. 13 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months and a head sentence of three years to date from 7 May 2009. This means that the offender is to be released to parole on 6 November 2010. The conditions of his release to parole are that he accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and that he attend all courses, counselling, programmes, and the like, as are required or recommended by the Probation and Parole Service; for example, attendance at Narcotics Anonymous, Alcohol Anonymous, and the SMART programme referred to by Dr Seidler in her report.

   JUDGMENT1. I am sentencing Steven Wayne Kirby. He comes before me for sentence because he has breached some bonds imposed by another judge. 2. On 23 February 2007 his Honour Judge C E O’Connor QC sentenced Mr Kirby for four groups of offences. In each case he sentenced Mr Kirby to periods of imprisonment but in each case suspended those terms of imprisonment under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In his Honour’s remarks on sentence, delivered on that day, his Honour set out the detail of the crimes that he was sentencing Mr Kirby for and Mr Kirby’s personal circumstances and his Honour set out - with respect in very clear terms - the reasons for the sentences which his Honour imposed.3. Since then Mr Kirby has breached the bonds which his Honour imposed. There are three breaches, all of which were offences themselves. The breaches occurred on 1 November 2007, 24 May 2008 and 30 November 2008. 4. On the first occasion Mr Kirby was committing drug related offences for which he was convicted on 5 May 2008. On the second occasion he assaulted a woman in the context of domestic violence. He was sentenced again in Wentworth Local Court on 1 September 2008 and on the third occasion he damaged some property for which he was sentenced in the Wentworth Local Court on 3 March 2009. In each case he was given a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.5. A breach report was obviously supplied to his Honour Judge O’Connor who indicated through my associate that he was happy with another judge dealing with the breach. 6. His Honour imposed for an offence of break and enter with intent to steal under s 113(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 a sentence of twelve months imprisonment. His Honour imposed for an offence of break and enter and commit serious indictable offence - in fact, there were four of those offences -sentences of fourteen months imprisonment which were to run concurrently. His Honour imposed for two offences of aggravated break enter and steal and commit serious indictable offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 sentences of eighteen months imprisonment which were to run concurrently and his Honour imposed for a further aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence a sentence of two years. In respect of that offence his Honour was taking into account four other offences under a form provided for according to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 7. The matter comes before me and the first matter which I have to determine under s 98 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is whether I am satisfied that Mr Kirby has failed to comply with any of the conditions of a good behaviour bond. I am so satisfied. The conditions included good behaviour and clearly Mr Kirby has breached the terms of those bonds insofar as he has not been of good behaviour. 8. I then have three choices, the third of which is that I may revoke the bond. Because the bonds were imposed under s 12 of the Act I am constrained by subs (3). Mr Clarke, who appears for Mr Kirby, does not submit that his client’s failure to comply with the conditions of bond was trivial or that there were good reasons for excusing his client’s failure to comply with conditions of the bond. With respect there could be no other position than the position taken by Mr Clarke.9. Accordingly, under s 98(2)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I revoke all of the bonds imposed upon Mr Kirby.10. The next step is that is under s 99 of the Act. I note that a consequence of my order revoking the bonds is that the orders by his Honour suspending the sentences imposed have ceased to have effect. Section 99(1)(c)(ii) directs me to s 24 of the Act. I am directed to take into account any time which Mr Kirby has been held in custody. I am informed and accept that he was arrested on 27 November 2009 and that the sentence should date at least from that date. 11. Mr Clarke submits that I should take into account a period of some eighty-eight days which his client spent in custody before being sentenced by his Honour Judge O’Connor.12. Ms White, who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, submits that I may take that into account but should make no allowance in this sentence. That is for the reason that his Honour in deciding to suspend the sentences which he imposed specifically referred to and took into account the period of eighty-eight days which had been served by Mr Kirby. 13. I agree with Ms White’s submissions. I take into account that period of eighty-eight days but I do not propose to make any allowance for it in these sentences because a significant allowance has already been made by Judge O’Connor.14. Returning to s 24, clause (b) requires me to take into account the fact that Mr Kirby has been the subject of such an order or bond. I have taken into account that he was and that for a period of some nine months he was of good behaviour. That, however, was short of half of the period of the bonds. I need to take into account anything done by Mr Kirby in compliance with his obligations. There is no evidence of non-compliance during the period of the first nine months. There is, however, evidence in the form of a presentence report from the Probation and Parole Service that a referral to a residential rehabilitation centre was unsuccessful. Mr Kirby had to leave after about a week because he brought cannabis into the facility. There are very limited, if any, matters which I can take into account so far as compliance with the bond is concerned. 15. I, therefore, need to finally return to Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in fixing these sentences as I am directed to by s 99 of that Act. And the focus of the submissions by Mr Clarke and Ms White were relating to the fixing of the non-parole period in accordance with s 44. Mr Clarke called his client to give evidence. He had taken himself off to South Australia. I make two observations about that. The first was that he was probably in breach of his parole and when required had to be extradited although I did not take that into account as an aggravating feature. The second observation is a positive observation; he went to stay with the mother of his daughter, Kalani, because he wanted to be with his daughter who is aged three. He also secured employment picking oranges and that for Mr Kirby was a good move. Given the history which Judge O’Connor set out in his Honour’s remarks on sentence, Mr Kirby is keen to help his daughter and to develop a relationship with her so that she knows her father. He acknowledges that he did not volunteer his presence to police when cross-examined by Ms White.16. Mr Clarke submits that the non-parole period should be reduced so that the balance of the term should be greater than one third of the non-parole period. He points to his client’s vulnerability because of findings made by his Honour and the evidence about his client’s mental capacity. He argues that that would lead to a difficult time in prison and that I should take that into account. Ms White argues that his Honour Judge O’Connor QC has already taken that into account. His Honour did, indeed, refer to Mr Kirby’s mental capacity in the context of general deterrence and with respect correctly referred to it as a matter relevant to that. 17. However, I accept Mr Clarke’s submission in this regard. The purpose of taking into account his client’s borderline mental capacity is not related to general deterrence but specifically related to fixing the proportion between the non-parole period and the balance of the term. It has a different function.18. I also take into account - as Ms White mentioned would be appropriate - the fact that it was Mr Kirby’s first time in custody and that he is only twenty years old. I need to have in mind that any sentence I impose at the end must be proportionate to the gravity of the offences which were set out by his Honour Judge O’Connor in his remarks on sentence. 19. I accept Mr Clarke’s submission that there should be some partial accumulation and partial concurrency. I do not think that they should be completely concurrent because, as Ms White said, there are separate victims to these crimes. But there needs to be some partial accumulation because it was, as described, a spate of break and enters within a period of a couple of months committed by Mr Clarke.20. I have determined the sentences which I will impose in accordance with s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 21. In respect of the offence of break enter and steal against s 113(1) of the Crimes Act I set a non-parole period of eight months to date from 27 November 2009 and to expire on 26 July 2010. The balance of the term will be four months to commence on 27 July 2010 and to expire on 26 November 2010. 22. In respect of the four offences of break and enter and commit serious indictable offences I fix non-parole periods of ten months to run concurrently with one another. They are to commence on 27 February 2010 and to expire on 26 December 2010. The balance of the term will be four months to commence on 27 December 2010 and to expire on 26 April 2011. 23. In respect of the two offences of aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act, I set concurrent non-parole periods of thirteen months to commence on 27 June 2010 and to expire on 26 July 2011. The balance of the terms will be five months commencing 27 July 2011 and expiring on 26 December 2011. 24. In respect of the aggravated break enter and steal and commit serious indictable offence in company against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act taking into account the offences on the Form 1, which his Honour did as well, I set a non-parole period of eight months to commence on 27 March 2011 and to expire on 26 November 2011. The balance of the term will be sixteen months to commence on 27 November 2011 and to expire on 26 March 2013. 25. I find special circumstances for altering the proportion between the non-parole period and the balance of the term in respect of that last sentence. Hence the overall sentence will be three years and four months with a non-parole period of two years. And that means I do not direct parole, does it not? Yes. First, mathematics.WHITE: Would your Honour mind repeating the sentence for the last offence?HIS HONOUR: A non-parole period of eight months commencing 27 March 2011 expiring 26 November 2011. The balance of term, sixteen months commencing 27 November 2011 and expiring 26 March 2013. No problem with the mathematics, Ms White?WHITE: No, your Honour.CLARKE: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Any factual errors or legal matters that I need to attend to okay.26. Mr Kirby, I have sentenced you. Now you have got the same sentences which Judge O’Connor gave you. Your overall sentence is three years and four months and you have got to spend two years of that in gaol. The two years commence when you were arrested, 27 November 2009, last month in South Australia. That two years finishes on 26 November 2011. You’ve got just under two years to serve. On 26 November 2011, two years from now, you are eligible for parole. Whether you get parole or not is not up to me it is up to the Parole Authority. They look at what you have been doing in prison and decide to release you on parole if they think that is appropriate. Then, as you know, you are on parole and you are on parole for sixteen months. Normally, for a sentence like that your parole would be shorter but I have made your parole longer so that you have got time to look at your life and perhaps get together with your daughter again and her mother and get some work as you are doing and perhaps even have some rehabilitation. I have allowed you extra time for that, you are also a young man. Specifically, you got your twelve months and then you got your fourteen months, your eighteen months and I have overlapped some of those so they are not just one after the other and the overall effect is as I said, forty months, three years and four months, two years in gaol from 27 November last and then you are on parole.Anything else, Mr Clarke, Ms White?WHITE: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: You want a word with your client?CLARKE: Yes, your Honour. Thank your Honour.

   DECISION: 
   In relation to the s 12 bonds imposed on 23 February 2007 revoke the order that they be suspended. Those sentences should therefore be served by way of full-time imprisonment to commence on 14 May 2009. In each case they will be fixed terms. For the offence of break enter and steal of 10 November 2008, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of two years to date from 14 May 2010. For the offence of taking and detaining for an advantage, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term to date from 14 May 2011. For the offence of aggravated stealing and breaking out, I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to commence on 14 May 2012. It will expire on 13 November 2014. I set on that last matter a head sentence of six years. The overall sentence is thus a non-parole period of five and a half years with a head sentence of nine years. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 13 November 2014.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Jason Nicholas first came before me in April 2006. He pleaded guilty to a number of offences and I was asked to take into account a number of other offences on a Form 1. Those offences were very serious. However, there were indications that Mr Nicholas was able to rehabilitate himself notwithstanding the seriousness of his offending. I gave him the benefit of a s 11 remand. He came back before me in February 2007. He had done well on the remand and he committed no further offences and so I acceded to the submission made on his behalf that whilst I should sentence Mr Nicholas to imprisonment, I should suspend those sentences. Things were looking good in February 2007 but they went downhill with the result that not only did Mr Nicholas breach the bond but he committed a number of further offences. In particular he committed two very serious offences on 24 March 2009. Notwithstanding the prospects of the offender’s rehabilitation in the future and notwithstanding his tragic background, his behaviour on 24 March 2009 was of such serious criminality that a lengthy sentence must necessarily be imposed.2 When I gave Mr Nicholas the benefit of suspending the sentence of imprisonment I imposed in February 2007, I explained to him that if he committed further offences he would go to gaol. Notwithstanding that clear warning the offender has committed further offences. He has also failed to comply with other conditions of the bond. A breach report in November 2008 noted that the offender’s whereabouts were unknown and that whilst initially he had participated in what the Probation and Parole Service required he had failed to report in more recent times and failed to attend sessions arranged for him and used drugs. The breach report also notes that Mr Nicholas was convicted of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. That matter is not before me and is awaiting sentence in the Local Court. The new offences are one of break enter and steal, one of taking or detain a person with intent to obtain an advantage and one of aggravated break enter and steal. That last matter carries with it a standard non-parole period of five years and a maximum penalty of twenty years. The standard non-parole period is not of direct application because the offender pleaded guilty to that offence. Standard non-parole periods are also very difficult to apply where a sentence must necessarily be accumulated on other sentences. Despite those factors, it is clear that by setting a standard non-parole period for this offence, the legislature was expecting that sentences for such offences should increase.3 The offender committed the first of his new offences on 10 November 2008. He has no recollection of committing that offence. We do know that on that day a householder left her unit locking the doors at about one o’clock in the afternoon. She locked not only all the windows and doors but a wrought iron gate at the front door and turned on the alarm. When she returned a few hours later she discovered the alarm system had been activated. When she went to the living area she saw that a glass sliding door had been smashed. When she went upstairs she saw what appeared to be blood smeared on the hallway wall. Of course it was this blood that later enabled police to identify Mr Nicholas as the person responsible for this offence. He had broken into the premises, taken the computer owned by the victim and rifled through other parts of the house looking for things to steal. A laptop was not recovered. That offence is a distressingly common offence. The offender cannot explain why he committed it because he has no recollection of doing so. The agreed facts in that matter note that the victim states that the offence made her feel violated and insecure. I have no doubt at all that that is the case. I have no doubt that the consequences for the victim extend far beyond simply having to pay the excess on her laptop which was insured and having to pay to have her doors repaired. 4 It says something about the seriousness of the offender’s other offence that the offence of 10 November 2008 pales into insignificance compared to what the offender did in March 2009. On that day the offender went to premises at Centennial Park. A document headed “Agreed Facts” was tendered to me but it is clear that the facts are not agreed at all in one particular area. The document says that the victim had left a door open, a door that faces onto the street had been left open but the offender recalls that the door was closed but unlocked. It is difficult to resolve the dispute but I have the evidence of the offender that the door was closed. In those circumstances I am prepared to proceed on the basis that the offender opened and closed an unlocked door. The relevance of that is that it affects the likelihood that when the offender went into the premises he was aware that they were occupied. Indeed they were. But the offender claims that he did not think that they were when he went inside. Ultimately not too much can be made of this in the offender’s favour because of what he did once he realised that in fact the premises were occupied. The victim of the offence, a woman, was standing next to her desk in a study which adjoined the bedroom. She saw the offender, he had a towel around his head exposing only his eyes. Not surprisingly the victim started to scream and the offender came at her saying “Just do what I say”. She tried to escape but the offender grabbed her and pushed her onto the floor. This is the commencement of the offence of detaining the victim. Not satisfied with having pushed her onto the ground he then hit her with an open hand twice. Of course the victim was very scared and worried that he was going to become even more violent. The offender pushed her again, pushed her towards the main bedroom. The victim quite understandably thought that she was about to be raped. She said “You can have anything, just don't hurt me”. He then told her to open a safe, that safe being located inside a cupboard on the floor in the bedroom. Because of her terror, she was shaking and scared and was unable to open the safe getting the code wrong on a number of occasions. The offender was displeased by this turn of events and said to her “This is your last fucking time because next time I am going to hurt you”. Of course statements such as that only added to the terror which the victim was no doubt already experiencing. She asked him to wait a few seconds. At this stage the telephone rang and the offender said “You called the fucking police”. Thankfully the phone stopped ringing. The victim then gave the offender the code and he tried to open the safe. He too was shaking and could not do so. Eventually he said “I’m going to go” and stood up and ran out of the room saying to the victim “You let me go”. She said “Well then just run. Run”. On the way out, he grabbed her handbag. It contained cash, personal cards of course and the handbag itself was a valuable one. When police and ambulance officers arrived at the premises they discovered that the victim was extremely upset and distressed. Quite understandably so. They also discovered that the offender had left one of his fingerprints behind. 5 Of course there is the substantial overlap between the criminality involved in taking and detaining the victim and the aggravated stealing and breaking out. And some of the factors that I have referred to such as the assault upon the victim aggravate both offences. Of course I have to be very careful not to double count circumstances of aggravation such as those. It will be clear when I announce the sentences of substantial overlap in the sentences for those two matters.6 I believe that I referred earlier to the offender’s tragic background. It is difficult to understand how someone could be as badly treated as the offender was. He has had setbacks, repeated setbacks throughout his life. They began very young. He was hit by a car when he was two years old and his maternal aunt who wrote a letter which was tendered to me today said that she never again saw the bright little boy that the offender was before the accident. He had learning difficulties throughout school. He was told that his father was dead although in truth he was in gaol serving a life sentence for murder. He lived with his mother for the first eight years of his life but she was an alcoholic and had abusive boyfriends and so the offender ran away and went to live with his maternal aunt. However, he missed his mother and went back to live with her. This was a mistake as there he was molested and abused by another of his mother’s boyfriends. At the age of thirteen he learnt for the first time that his father was not in fact dead but in gaol. He decided he would like to visit his father and so he arranged with a woman to take him to the prison so that he could meet his father for the first time. The offender was sadly disappointed by his father’s reaction. The offender told me that his father was more interested in the woman who had taken him to the gaol than he was in his son. On his father’s release from custody, he had more contact with the offender but that too ended in tragedy. The offender was attempting to stop his father using drugs but he was unsuccessful, his father eventually dying of a drug overdose. That was yet another setback in the offender’s life which he says was a significant factor in him relapsing and starting to use drugs again. 7 So far I have referred to external tragedies in the offender’s life but there are other more internal difficulties that he faces as well. He suffers from a very significant illness, paranoid schizophrenia. Although at one level he appreciates that he is mentally ill and that he needs to take his medication, as with many offenders, and many people with mental illness, he does not like taking his medication and wants to be normal. He is also concerned about the side effects of the medication. He told me, and there is a reference to it in the material before me, for example that he had to have operations on his chest to overcome some of the side effects of the medication. What led to him declining to take his medication most recently was that he saw something on website saying that there had been a class action commenced by users of the medication because it was sending people blind.8 The circumstances of the three most recent offences too, also demonstrate a causal nexus between his offending and his mental illness, not only because of his drug and alcohol problem but because of voices that the offender hears which are impressing upon him the urgency to pay his outstanding drug debts. He may well have had drug debts at the time but his mental illness meant that he was much less able than a person who did not hear voices to reason about the consequences of what he was doing.9 The offender expressed his remorse in particular in relation to the offence involving the woman at Centennial Park. It particularly affected him because as he was growing up he saw his mother abused. I accept that the offender is genuine in what he says about his attitude towards his offending. 10 The standard non-parole period offence, that is aggravated steal and then break out, is objectively above the middle of the range of objective seriousness although as I mentioned earlier, some of the matters that aggravate that offence are also aggravating circumstances of the detaining offence. That is not to underestimate the seriousness of his conduct. Not only was there someone home at the time, but once the offender realised that fact he did not run away immediately but instead took advantage of the fact that the victim was there in order to have her open the safe. He needed her to open the safe for him and that is why he detained her.11 Were it not for the offender’s tragic background, I would have imposed much more significant sentences indeed. Not all of us have the same ability to reason about the rightfulness and wrongfulness of our behaviour. The offender is much less able than others to do that because of his background and because of his mental illness. On the other hand, the offender was nevertheless still very much aware that his behaviour was seriously criminal. Because of his mental illness the principles of general deterrence have less of a role to play but the offender must nevertheless be personally deterred from future misconduct of any kind and certainly misconduct of this kind. It is also important to bear in mind that the offender was able to at one stage to lead a law abiding lifestyle in that period leading up to February 2007 and so it cannot be said that there are no prospects of rehabilitation in the future. I will do what I can to assist the offender’s rehabilitation by making a finding of special circumstances. I have thus reduced the effective non-parole period from what I would otherwise have imposed. It remains the case however that a lengthy non-parole period is required and the effective non-parole period I will shortly announce is the least that I consider properly reflects the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct. The sentences have all also been reduced by twenty-five percent to reflect the offender’s early pleas of guilty.12 In relation to the s 12 bonds imposed on 23 February 2007, I revoke the order that they be suspended. Those sentences should therefore be served by way of full-time imprisonment to commence on 14 May 2009. In each case they will be fixed terms because of other sentences I must impose. For the offence of break enter and steal of 10 November 2008, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of two years to date from 14 May 2010. For the offence of taking and detaining for an advantage, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a period of three years fixed term to date from 14 May 2011. For the offence of aggravated stealing and breaking out, I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to commence on 14 May 2012. It will expire on 13 November 2014. I set on that last matter a head sentence of six years. The overall sentence is thus a non-parole period of five and a half years with a head sentence of nine years. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 13 November 2014.

      DIRECTOR-GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT & CLIMATE CHANGE v GLEESON; DIRECTOR-GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT & CLIMATE CHANGE v EPACRIS PTY LTD (No. 2) [2009] NSWLEC 200 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 6 April 2009, I permanently stayed prosecutions brought under the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1997 against each defendant, Epacris Pty Ltd and Mr David John Gleeson, a director of Epacris: Director-General, Department of Environment and Climate Change v Epacris Pty Ltd; Director-General, Department of Environment and Climate Change v Gleeson [2009] NSWLEC 42; (2009) 165 LGERA 99. The defendants now claim an order that the prosecutor pay the defendants’ costs of the proceedings in each case. The questions for determination are: 
     
      
       
      (a) whether the Court has the power to make an order for costs where the prosecution is permanently stayed, rather than dismissed; and 
       
       
      (b) if so, whether in the exercise of the Court’s discretion an order for costs should be made. 
       
       
       
      
    Does the Court have the power to make an order for costs? 
     
      
    2 The prosecutor submits that: (a) the jurisdiction to make an order for costs in criminal prosecutions is statutory; (b) the statutory jurisdiction only permits an order against a prosecutor where the court has made an order dismissing the charge for an offence; and (c) a stay does not amount to dismissal of a charge. 
     
      
    3 The defendants submit that: (a) the Court has both a statutory and an inherent or implied power to make an order for costs in criminal proceedings; (b) if the power is only statutory, a permanent stay is an order which is tantamount to dismissal of a charge; and (c) alternatively, the power to make an order following a stay does not depend upon statutory provisions as to costs but stems from the inherent or implied power to control and properly dispose of proceedings. 
     
      
       
      
    The statutory power to order payment of costs 
     
      
    4 The parties agree that the statutory power to order the payment of costs in the present case is s 253 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. That section was repealed on 13 July 2006, when a new raft of statutory provisions as to costs in criminal proceedings was enacted - see now Pt 5 Div 4 of the Act (ss 257A to 257G). Section 253, despite its repeal, is saved, however, and continues to apply to the present proceedings by the Criminal Procedure Act, Sch 2, cl 50. 
     
      
    5 Section 253 relevantly stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        253 Court may order payment of costs 
        
       
       
        
        (1) A court may, in and by a conviction or order, order an accused person to pay to the prosecutor such costs as the court specifies or, if the conviction or order directs, as may be determined under subsection (2), if:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the court convicts the accused person of an offence, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) (Repealed) 
          
         
         
          
          (c) the court makes an order under section 10 of the  
          Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
           in respect of an offence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (1A) A court may, if the court makes an order dismissing the charge for an offence, in and by that order, order the prosecutor to pay to the accused person such costs as the court specifies or, if the order directs, as may be determined under subsection (2). 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The costs payable by a prosecutor or accused person in accordance with a direction under this section are to be determined:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) by agreement between the prosecutor and accused person, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) if no such agreement can be reached, in accordance with the rules. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        ...” 
        
       
       
      
    The prosecutor’s submissions 
     
      
    6 Shortly stated, the prosecutor submits that the statute is a code which covers the field and that dismissal of a charge is a final order made after a hearing on the merits, whereas a stay is an interlocutory order. The prosecutor further submits that “an order dismissing the charge”, referred to in s 253(1A), is informed by the historical background to the statute and understood by construing the words in their context. 
     
      
    7 Before 7 July 2003, summary criminal proceedings in this Court were regulated by ss 41 to 55 of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979. Section 52 was to a similar effect as s 253 of the Criminal Procedure Act: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        52 Judge may order payment of costs 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Where a Judge:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) convicts any person of an offence punishable in the summary jurisdiction of the Court, 
          
         
         
          
          (b) makes an order dismissing the charge for any such offence, or 
          
         
         
          
          (c) makes an order under section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in respect of any such offence, 
          
         
         
         the Judge may, in and by the conviction or order, order the defendant, in the case of a conviction or order referred to in paragraph (a) or (c), to pay to the prosecutor, or, in the case of an order referred to in paragraph (b), order the prosecutor to pay to the defendant, costs of such amount as are specified in the conviction or order or, if the conviction or order so directs, as may be determined under subsection (2). 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The costs payable by a prosecutor or defendant in accordance with a direction under this section are to be determined:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) by agreement between the prosecutor and defendant, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) if no such agreement can be reached, in accordance with the regulations. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        ...” 
        
       
      
    8 In Director-General, Department of Land and Water Conservation v Pye (No. 2) [1999] NSWLEC 45, I held, at [17], that s 52 is a specific provision as to costs in the Court’s summary criminal jurisdiction which circumscribed the general power to make orders for costs under the then s 69 of the Land and Environment Court Act. In Mantel v Anstee [2001] NSWLEC 202; (2001) 116 LGERA 269, Bignold J held, at [4], that the Court’s power to order costs in the summary criminal jurisdiction is exclusively governed by s 52 of the Land and Environment Court Act, since “the general costs power conferred by s 69 of that Act is expressly declared not to apply to proceedings in Class 5, 6 or 7 of the Court’s jurisdiction: vide s 69(8)”. In Carter v Wall [2003] NSWLEC 94; (2003) 126 LGERA 310, Cowdroy J held, at [23], that since the broad discretion to award costs under s 69 of the Land and Environment Court Act does not apply to the summary criminal jurisdiction, then s 52(1) is the only statutory provision that enables the Court to make orders for costs in such proceedings. 
     
      
    9 Upon repeal of ss 41 to 55 of the Land and Environment Court Act, the statutory provision relating to costs in criminal proceedings was s 253 of the Criminal Procedure Act. A similar provision to s 52 existed in the Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act 1967, s 14, since repealed, so that costs in the summary criminal jurisdiction of the Supreme Court are also now governed by the provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act - initially s 253 and, since the repeal of that section on 13 July 2006, by ss 257A to 257G. 
     
      
    10 The prosecutor submits that the phrase “an order dismissing the charge” in each of s 253 of the Criminal Procedure Act, s 52 of the Land and Environment Court Act and s 14 of the Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act gains its meaning from the predecessor provisions, first in the Summary Jurisdiction Act 1848 (UK) and then the Justices Act 1902 (NSW). 
     
      
    11 The Summary Jurisdiction Act 1848 (UK) applied in New South Wales until 1902. Section 14, which provided for the conduct of the hearing of an information or complaint, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “ ... and the said Justice or Justices, having heard what each Party shall have to say as aforesaid, and the Witnesses and Evidence so adduced, shall consider the whole matter, and determine the same, and shall convict or make an Order upon the Defendant, or dismiss the Information or Complaint, as the Case may be; ... 
        ” 
        
       
      
    12 The section then stated that if the justice or justices were to dismiss the information or complaint then: 
     
      
       
        
        “... 
        it shall be lawful for such Justice or Justices, if he or they shall think fit, being required so to do, to make an Order of Dismissal of the same, and shall give the Defendant in that Behalf a Certificate thereof, which said Certificate afterwards, upon being produced, without further Proof, shall be a Bar to any subsequent Information or Complaint for the same Matter respectively against the same Party... 
        ” 
        
       
      
    13 Section 18 stated that in cases where the justice or justices dismiss the information or complaint: 
     
      
       
        
        “...  
        it shall be lawful for him or them, in his or their Discretion, in and by his or their order of Dismissal to award and order that the Prosecutor or Complaint respectively shall pay to the Defendant such Costs as to such Justice or Justices shall seem just and reasonable 
        ,...” 
        
       
      
    14 The Summary Jurisdiction Act was repealed and replaced by the Justices Act 1902 (NSW). Section 80 relevantly stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “After hearing what each party has to say and the witnesses and the evidence adduced, the said Justice or Justices shall consider and determine the whole matter, and convict or make an order upon the defendant or dismiss the information or complaint, as the case may require.” 
        
       
      
    15 Section 85 provided for the drawing up of an order of dismissal and giving the defendant a certificate thereof, which would operate as a bar to a subsequent information or complaint for the same matter against the same person. 
     
      
    16 Section 81(1) provided for the making of an order for costs: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The Justice or Justices making any conviction or order may in and by such conviction or order adjudge that the defendant shall pay to the prosecutor or complainant or, in the case of an order of dismissal, that the prosecutor or complainant shall pay to the defendant such costs as to the Justice or Justices seem just and reasonable 
        ”. 
        
       
      
    17 In July 2003, the provisions of the Justices Act described above were replaced by the respective provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act. At the same time, the provisions of the Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act and the Land and Environment Court Act, to which I have referred above, were replaced by the respective provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act. 
     
      
    18 In the prosecutor’s submission, under both the Summary Jurisdiction Act 1848 and the Justices Act 1902, an order dismissing an information or complaint is a reference to a final order made after hearing the evidence and submissions. So too, according to the submission, the reference to an order dismissing a charge in s 253(1A) of the Criminal Procedure Act, is a final order made after hearing the evidence and submissions. The historical and jurisdictional context supports this conclusion. Dismissal of a charge is the completion of the proceedings commenced by the charge, entitling the defendant to a plea of autrefois acquit.  
     
      
    19 The prosecutor further submits that a stay is not a dismissal of a charge after a hearing, neither is a person having the benefit of a stay entitled to a certificate of dismissal. Rather, a stay is interlocutory and characterised as a refusal to exercise jurisdiction (citing Jago v District Court (NSW) (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 76, inter alia). 
     
      
       
      
    The defendants’ submissions 
     
      
    20 Mr J M Ireland QC and Mr J B Maston, appearing for the defendants, submit that if s 253 of the Criminal Procedure Act is the only source of power to make an order for costs (now ss 257A to 257G), then a permanent stay is a final order in the sense that no further proceedings on the charges can be taken by the prosecutor, the charges cannot be pressed further, the charges can never be tried, the order has the effect of permanently terminating the prosecution, and the prosecution has been “dismissed” for the purpose of that section. 
     
      
    21 Mr Ireland relies upon the definition of “dismissal of proceedings” in the Butterworths Australian Legal Dictionary (1997): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        An order for the termination of the plaintiff’s action in favour of the defendant. The order is generally made in exercise of the court’s inherent jurisdiction to prevent abuse of process 
        .” 
        
       
      
    22 Mr Ireland also relies upon dictionary meanings of the word “dismiss”: 
     
      
       
      The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles 
       (1973): 
       
       
        
        “...  
        6. 
         To have done with (a subject), bring to an end; hence to treat of summarily.

    23 Mr Ireland submits that the drafter of the section has clearly used a more general word rather than narrower specific words such as “acquit” or “discharge”, so that the effect is to mean to dismiss a charge out of court, including the notion of an order which permanently stays a prosecution.  
     
      
       
      
    The statutory power does not apply in this case 
     
      
    24 I accept the force of the prosecutor’s submissions noted in pars [6] to [19] above; that is, that the historical context of the predecessor provisions shows that an order for costs may be made upon a dismissal of a charge after a full hearing of the matter and that dismissal of a charge is the completion of the proceedings entitling the defendant to a certificate of dismissal and the benefit of a plea of autrefois acquit. 
     
      
    25 I find that the question of whether the statutory power applies is nicely balanced. The strongest argument in favour of the application of the statutory power to a permanent stay of a prosecution seems to be as follows. Although a permanent stay means that there has been no hearing of the evidence relating to the charge, its effect is the same as a certificate of dismissal otherwise entitling the defendant to a plea of autrefois acquit. The prosecution is effectively terminated and if a fresh prosecution was to be brought upon the same facts giving rise to the prosecution that has been permanently stayed, then it too would be permanently stayed as either an abuse of process or res judicata. That is, a permanent stay has the same operation as a dismissal of the charge. I thus acknowledge the force of the submissions of counsel for the defendants at pars [20] to [23] above.  
     
      
    26 I find, however, that despite these considerations, the authorities are to the contrary and show that the statutory power to make an order for costs does not extend to the making of an order for a permanent stay of a prosecution. 
     
      
    27 In Ward v Hodgkins [1957] VR 715, Herring CJ had to consider certain provisions of the Justices Act 1928 (Vic) relating to the grant of a certificate of dismissal. Section 88(17) of that Act stated, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        If the court dismisses such information complaint or set-off or counterclaim, such court shall make an order for dismissal of the same, and shall give the defendant ... in that behalf a certificate thereof ... if the same is demanded; which certificate without further proof shall upon its production be a bar to any other information complaint action or legal proceeding in any court... for the same matters respectively against the same party 
        .” 
        
       
      
    28 The salient facts were that criminal charges brought in a court of petty sessions were dismissed for want of prosecution and the informations were dismissed and certificates of dismissal under s 88(17) of the Act were given to the defendant. Herring CJ thought it relevant to consider the history of the legislation on which s 88(17) of the Act was based. His Honour went back to the Summary Jurisdiction Act 1848 (UK), which previously operated in Victoria and which I have relevantly summarised at pars [11] to [13] above. As to this, Herring CJ said, at 724: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        An examination of the form, content and language of s14 of [the Summary Jurisdiction Act] shews I think quite clearly that under that section certificates of dismissal could be granted to defendants only in respect of dismissals that followed upon a hearing and determination. In the first place it was only with dismissals of this kind that the section dealt; ... ” 
        
       
      
    29 Herring CJ went on to hold, at 728, that certificates of dismissal could only be granted under s 88(17) in respect of dismissals after a hearing. The certificates of dismissal were thus not validly granted. 
     
      
    30 The judgment of Herring CJ in Ward v Hodgkins was followed and applied by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland in R v Hay; Ex parte Patane [1981] Qd R 152. 
     
      
    31 In R v Nicholl; Ex parte Webster (1979) 26 ACTR 19; (1979) 1 A Crim R 306, Blackburn CJ considered a provision of the Court of Petty Sessions Ordinance 1930 (ACT), s 244(1) of which stated: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(1) The power of the Court to award costs and the award of costs by the Court shall be subject to the following provisions:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) Where the Court makes a conviction or order in favour of the informant, it may in its discretion award and order that the defendant shall pay to the informant such costs as it thinks just and reasonable;  
          
         
         
          
          (b) Where the Court dismisses the information, or makes an order in favour of the defendant, it may in its discretion award and order that the informant shall pay to the defendant such costs as it thinks just and reasonable 
          ;""  
          
         
        
       
      
    32 A magistrate had ruled at a committal hearing that there was insufficient evidence to warrant the respondent being put upon his trial for an indictable offence. He added the words: “The charge is dismissed and the defendant is discharged.”. After hearing counsel, the magistrate then purported to order that the prosecutor should pay the defendants’ costs. 
     
      
    33 Blackburn CJ held, at 22 (ACTR) 309 (A Crim R), that the magistrate should not have said the words “the charge is dismissed”. The Chief Justice said, at 21 (ACTR) 308 (A Crim R): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        In this case, although the Court purported to ‘dismiss the information’, that was plainly ineffective. The magistrate was engaged in conducting a preliminary examination of a person charged with an indictable offence for the purpose of committal for trial, and not adjudicating upon the hearing of a charge 
        .” 
        
       
      
    34 Blackburn CJ went on to hold, at 22 (ACTR) 308 (A Crim R): 
     
      
       
        
        “... 
        that dismissal implies an adjudication upon the issues between the informant and the defendant in a manner favourable to the defendant. The decision that the evidence is not sufficient to warrant the accused person's being put upon his trial for an indictable offence is certainly not an adjudicative order which determines the issues between the informant and the defendant,. 
        ..” 
        
       
      
    35 Blackburn CJ also held, at 22 (ACTR) 308 (A Crim R), that the magistrate should not have used the words “the charge is dismissed” and the fact that he did so provided no justification for an order for costs under s 244(1)(b) of the Ordinance. 
     
      
    36 In Walker v Baehnk (No. 2) (1987) 44 SASR 380, Legoe J considered s 133 of the Justices Act 1921 (SA), which stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        A defendant who obtains an order of dismissal, or is convicted, under the provisions hereof, shall be released from all further or other criminal proceedings for the same cause 
        .”  
        
       
       
      His Honour held that the word “dismissal” in s 133 meant a dismissal  
      on the merits 
       of the case. 
       
      
    37 These authorities, together with the historical background relied upon by the prosecutor, noted at pars [10] to [17] above, persuade me that the statutory power to make an order that the prosecutor pay the defendants’ costs does not apply in the present case. That power is only enlivened following a dismissal of the charges on the merits of the case. Moreover, as Blackburn CJ has demonstrated in R v Nicholls; Ex parte Webster, unless there has been a determination on the merits of the case there is no power under the statute to make an order for costs. This conclusion is consistent with the authorities based on previous legislation in this Court, noted at par [8] above. 
     
      
       
      
    An inherent or implied power to order costs? 
     
      
    38 The defendants submit that the Court has an inherent or implied power to properly control and dispose of proceedings, including the making of orders for costs where appropriate. The defendants further submit that the general rule that costs will not be ordered in a criminal prosecution either in favour or against the prosecutor, absent any statutory power to do so, no longer applies. (Reference was made to R v Goia (1988) 19 FCR 212 and Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534.) 
     
      
    39 In Logwon Pty Ltd v Warringah Shire Council (1993) 33 NSWLR 13, Sheller JA (Powell JA concurring) held, at 28, that this Court, being a superior court, has an inherent jurisdiction, except to the extent that it is inconsistent with the particular statutory jurisdiction vested. Kirby P, however, preferred to reserve talk of inherent jurisdiction to the Supreme Court and the High Court entertaining appeals from it, and preferred the term implied jurisdiction (at 17). Kirby P also went on to say however, that “The foregoing distinction is doubtless elusive, perhaps metaphysical.” Similarly, in R v JS (No. 2) [2007] NSWCCA 309; (2007) 179 A Crim R 10, Spigelman CJ said, at [3], that it is usual to refer to a statutory court as having an implied jurisdiction. 
     
      
    40 In my view, this Court, as a superior court exercising a criminal jurisdiction, has the same jurisdiction whether it be called inherent or implied as that of other superior courts exercising a criminal jurisdiction, except to the extent that it is inconsistent with statute. 
     
      
    41 In R v JS, the Court of Criminal Appeal rejected an appeal from an acquittal by directed verdict in favour of the respondent. The respondent then made an application for an order for costs. The problem for the respondent was that s 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provided that “on the hearing or determination of an appeal, or any proceedings preliminary or incidental thereto under this Act, no costs shall be allowed on either side”. As to this, Spigelman CJ said, at [12], that this “reflects the basic proposition that the power to award costs in a criminal case requires statutory authority”. The Chief Justice said, at [14]: “The traditional common law position that costs are not awarded in criminal proceedings is reflected in s 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act”. I note, however, that there is no provision in the Criminal Procedure Act which is to the same effect as s 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
     
      
    42 In Director of Public Prosecutions v Boykin (Supreme Court of New South Wales, 21 June 1994, unreported), Wood J held that although a Local Court magistrate has an implied power to stay criminal proceedings, since such a power is an essential attribute to the exercise of that Court’s jurisdiction, “it does not inevitably follow that a power to order costs is associated with it”, there being “no general or inherent power in the Local Court to make costs orders”. Wood J held: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The absence of a general implied power to make costs orders, and the fact that a stay will itself largely redress the hardship suffered by a defendant faced with an abuse of process, leads me to the view that the relevant power to order costs against the DPP does not exist, as an implied power 
        ”. 
        
       
      
    43 In R v Goia (1988) 19 FCR 212, the respondent had obtained a permanent stay on an indictment and an order that the Crown pay his costs of the notice of motion for the stay. On appeal, the order for costs was set aside on the ground of the general rule as to costs in criminal cases that costs will not be awarded in favour or against the Crown. Forster and Pincus JJ saw no difference between interlocutory and final proceedings so far as costs are concerned. Miles J, dissenting, was of the view that the principle does not apply to an application to stay proceedings as an abuse of process, noting that the application had nothing to do with the guilt or innocence of Mr Gioa, and the exercise of the jurisdiction to grant a stay does not involve a determination “in a criminal cause or matter”. 
     
      
    44 In Watson v Attorney-General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 685, the Court of Appeal, in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction, stayed a criminal proceeding that was pending in the District Court and awarded costs in favour of the successful applicant, the accused. The process in the Supreme Court in that case was not, however, a criminal proceeding, being a proceeding commenced by summons in the Court of Appeal. 
     
      
    45 In Markisic v Vizza [2002] NSWCCA 53, the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal on the grounds that it was incompetent and that the Court of Criminal Appeal had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The respondents sought costs of the proceedings before the Court of Criminal Appeal. Stein JA (Dowd and Barr JJ concurring) said, at [28], that whilst s 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act provides that no costs shall be allowed on either side on the hearing or determination of an appeal, this does not mean that the Court of Criminal Appeal has no jurisdiction to make an order for costs. Stein JA continued, at [31] and [32]: 
     
      
       
        
        “While the proceedings purport to be brought under the Act, they in fact were not so brought, and s17(1) has therefore no power to awarding costs of the court. 
        
       
       
        
        The Court of Criminal Appeal has implied power to control abuse of its processes. This purported appeal from McClellan J is an abuse of process. It is an incident to such a power to control abuses of its processes that the court has implied (or inherent) power to order the applicants to pay the respondents' costs. See  
        Darcey v Pre-Term Foundation Clinic 
         (1983) 2 NSWLR 497 at 503;  
        R v Barbaro 
         (1992) 106 FLR 387 at 389; and  
        Director General, Department of Community Services v Houdek 
         [1999] NSWSC 1031. The dichotomy between implied and inherent powers matters not in this context.” 
        
       
      
    46 Again, I find the parties’ positions nicely balanced. I am inclined to the view, however, that the Court has an implied jurisdiction to award costs in the present circumstance. I have come to this view for the following reasons. 
     
      
    47 Firstly, in R v JS, Spigelman CJ acknowledged that the power to control proceedings for abuse of process is accompanied by the power to award costs except where the statute prohibits it. The Chief Justice said, at [6]: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        As part of its implied jurisdiction this Court has power to control abuse of its process and, as an incident of that power, may order a person who has abused that process to pay the other party’s costs, at least where s 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act does not apply 
        .” 
        
       
       
      As I have noted, there is in the present case no statutory provision, such as s 17 of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
      , which says that no costs shall be allowed on either side - that is, there is no statutory provision which prohibits the power to award costs. 
       
      
    48 Secondly, I am bound by the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Markisic v Vizza, and in particular by the passages which I have quoted at par [45] above. The decision of the Full Court of Federal Court in R v Gioa is not binding upon me. In the latter case, the dissenting judgment of Miles J is more consistent with those of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v JS and Markisic v Vizza. The present proceedings did not involve a hearing and determination of the proceedings as required by s 253 of the Criminal Procedure Act, so that the practice that the Crown does not seek or incur costs in criminal cases does not apply. 
     
      
    49 Thirdly, I reject the submission of Mr D A Buchahan SC and Mr E G H Cox, appearing for the prosecutor, that the Court has no power in a criminal proceeding to order costs even where the Court rules on such things as motions to set aside subpoenas, absent any statutory authority to so order. This submission is contrary to authority. In Darcey v Pre-Term Foundation Clinic [1983] 2 NSWLR 497, Hunt J held that in a summary criminal prosecution a magistrate had an inherent power to set aside a subpoena. His Honour then considered (at 503) s 81 of the Justices Act 1902, which permitted costs to be awarded against a defendant in favour of the prosecutor or complainant in the event of a conviction or order, and against the prosecutor or complainant in favour of the defendant in the event of an order of dismissal. His Honour held, however, that the inherent power of the magistrate carries with it the inherent power to award costs in relation to the application and “such an inherent power exists independently of, and is not necessarily to be implied only from, the statutory provisions conferring jurisdiction upon the court” (at 504). 
     
      
    50 This judgment has been followed and applied in R v Barbaro (1992) 108 ACTR 1; (1992) 106 FLR 387 per Miles CJ and in Director-General, Department of Community v Houdek [1999] NSWSC 1031 per Bell J. 
     
      
    51 Fourthly, in the present case, the presence of s 253 in the Criminal Procedure Act is a statutory expression by the legislature designed to abrogate the general practice of having the prosecution neither seeking costs nor having costs awarded against it in criminal proceeding. The absence of an express provision in the Criminal Procedure Act to the same effect as s 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act suggests that the courts’ implied power to make orders for costs is otherwise unaffected. 
     
      
    52 Fifthly, the statement by Bignold J in Liverpool City Council v Hodge [2006] NSWLEC 21; (2006) 143 LGERA 261 at 266 that in the case of criminal proceedings, the statutory costs power creates the true boundaries of the power and those boundaries are not to be extended by recourse to concepts of inherent or implied judicial power, is a statement that must be seen in the context of an application for costs on an indemnity basis, whereas the statute itself specified the basis upon which costs are to be calculated. That is, Bignold J was exercising the statutory power under s 253 of the Criminal Procedure Act after dismissing the summons for offences against the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979. His Honour’s determination has no bearing on the question which is now before me. 
     
      
    53 Sixthly, the purpose of the grant of a permanent stay is to prevent what would otherwise have been an abuse of the court process, and an order for costs in such circumstances is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s decision in Watson v Attorney-General, noted at par [44] above, and the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in Markisic v Vizza, noted at par [45] above. 
     
      
       
      
    Should an order for costs be made in the exercise of the Court’s discretion?  
     
      
    54 The motions for a permanent stay having been successful, it would normally follow that costs would follow the event. That is, there should be an order that the prosecutor pay the defendants’ costs of the notices of motion. 
     
      
    55 A more difficult question is whether the defendants are entitled to any costs associated with the principal proceedings. The defendants submit that it would be fair and reasonable that the prosecutor should also pay the defendants’ costs for the period from the date of filing of the notices of motion, 13 February 2009, until the date of delivery of the reserved judgment on the motions, 6 April 2009 - which was also the date fixed for the commencement of the trial. 
     
      
    56 The prosecutor submits that there should be no order for costs, but if any order for costs is to be made, it should be limited to the costs of the notices of motion, principally because the costs of preparation for the trial were necessarily incurred as a result of the late filing of the notices of motion, some three years and two months after the commencement of the proceedings and after the prosecutions had been set down for hearing. 
     
      
    57 In the light of the prosecutor’s submission it is necessary to have regard to the long history of the proceedings. The prosecutions were commenced by summonses filed as long ago as 9 December 2005. Thereafter, there was a succession of contested interlocutory proceedings - principally, Director-General Department of Planning v Epacris Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLEC 306; (2006) 147 LGERA 372; Epacris Pty Ltd v Director-General Department of Natural Resources [2007] NSWCCA 76; (2007) 69 NSWLR 507; (2007) 153 LGERA 173; Director-General Department of Natural Resources v Gleeson [2007] NSWLEC 749 and, finally, Director-General Department of Environment and Climate Change v Gleeson [2009] NSWLEC 42; (2009) 165 LGERA 99 (the motions for a permanent stay). 
     
      
    58 As already noted, the notices of motion for a permanent stay were filed some three years and two months after the commencement of the proceedings and the reserved judgment on the motion was delivered on the first day that had been fixed for the trial, 6 April 2009. The defendants’ solicitor, Mr McGirr, first raised what he saw as the injustice of the situation with his senior counsel when the proceedings were commenced, but it was not until late 2008 that he sought the formal advice of senior counsel as to whether a remedy was available. A formal advice by the defendants’ senior and junior counsel is dated 29 January 2009, which states that grounds existed for an application for a permanent stay. The notices of motion were then promptly filed on 13 February 2009. 
     
      
    59 I accept the prosecutor’s submission that it was not the prosecutor’s fault that the defendants’ solicitor did not seek counsel’s advice until late 2008. It is no doubt for this reason that the defendants now seek only those costs of the principal proceeding which were incurred after 13 February 2009. 
     
      
    60 A consequence of the somewhat belated filing of the notices of motion was that it was not until the date fixed for the trial that the motions were determined, by which time the parties had necessarily expended considerable resources in preparing for the hearing. It is self-evident that none of these costs would have been incurred if the defendants had sought and obtained the advice of counsel earlier. In my view, the conduct of the prosecutor has been blameless and it has been put to considerable expense which would otherwise have been avoided if the notices of motion for a permanent stay had been brought on at an appropriately earlier stage in the proceedings. In these circumstances it is appropriate that the costs should be limited to the costs of the notices of motion. 
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    61 In my opinion, the appropriate order would be that the prosecutor pay the defendants’ costs of the notices of motion for a permanent stay filed on 13 February 2009. 
     
      
    62 At Mr Buchahan’s request, however, I grant a short adjournment before making these orders in order to afford him the benefit of these reasons with a view to considering whether to apply for a stated case for the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal on the subject. The proceedings will be listed before me at 9:30 am on 15 December 2009 for either the making of final orders or for the making of an application for a stated case. 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          I hereby certify that the preceding 62 paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment herein of the Honourable Mr Justice D H Lloyd.

      (1) Application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    4 This is an application for leave to appeal by the applicant who is presently 17 years of age (date of birth, 6 June 1992). He was aged 15 years and 2 months at the time of the offence in question and 16 years and 1 month at the time of sentence. 
     
      
    5 The applicant entered a plea of guilty in the District Court in Tamworth on 2 June 2008. The sentencing hearing took place in Sydney on 14 and 29 July 2008. He was sentenced on the latter date in terms set out in paragraph [10]. 
     
      
    6 The indictment contained six counts. The applicant pleaded not guilty to Count 1 (attempted murder), but pleaded guilty to an offence under s.198, Crimes Act 1900 (Count 2) with which he was charged in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “On 10 August 2007 at Tamworth in the State of New South Wales did maliciously damage property, namely, a dwelling house, with intent by that damage to endanger the life of  
        [EMC] 
        .” 
        
       
      
    7 The Crown accepted the applicant’s plea to Count 2 in full discharge of the indictment. 
     
      
    8 The applicant was arrested on 12 August 2007. He has been in custody bail refused since that date. He had been subject to a control order since 12 August 2007 as a result of a separate incident in respect of which he was charged with take and detain for advantage. 
     
      
    9 Accordingly, the sentence imposed in respect of the subject offence under s.198 of the Crimes Act was expressed to commence on 12 February 2008, the date upon which the non-parole period of the earlier sentence referred to in the preceding paragraph expired. 
     
      
       
      (2) The sentence imposed 
       
      
    10 The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of six years to commence on 12 February 2008 and to expire on 11 February 2014, with a parole period of six years expiring on 11 February 2020. 
     
      
    11 The subject offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty was a serious children’s indictable offence within the meaning of that term as defined in s.3(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. An order was therefore made pursuant to s.19 of that Act. Accordingly, the applicant will serve the initial period of his sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender until he attains the age of 21 years. On the sentence imposed he will be required, once he attains the age of 21 years, to serve a period of approximately eight months as an adult offender. 
     
      
    12 The maximum penalty for the offence was a period of imprisonment for 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period for the offence for the purposes of Part 4 Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
       
      (3) The facts 
       
      
    13 In his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge recorded the relevant facts which were based on an agreed statement of facts tendered in the sentencing proceedings (Exhibit A). 
     
      
    14 The applicant, as previously stated, was aged 15 years and two months at the date of the offence. The victim was, at that time, aged 14 years and 10 months. The applicant entered the victim’s house, assaulted her, tied her up, splashed petrol around the house and set the house on fire. He then left the house. The victim managed to free herself from her bindings and fled the burning house. 
     
      
    15 The Remarks on Sentence (at pp.7 to 10) record the following facts and observations:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… 
        
       
       
        
        In August 2007 EMC lived in a house at … Coledale, a residential area in Tamworth. The offender and EMC are said to have been boyfriend and girlfriend for a short time, but by 10 August 2007 this had come to an end. The offender knew the occupants of the home at … and occasionally visited there. He had visited the victim’s home on a couple of occasions before the date of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        On Wednesday 8 August 2007 the victim’s mother was admitted to hospital where she remained for several days. EMC continued to live at home and from time to time visited the occupants of number seven. 
        
       
       
        
        During the evening of 9 August 2007 EMC visited number seven. The offender was also visiting but there was little interaction between them. At midnight EMC returned home to retire for the night. She locked the doors and windows and watched television in her bedroom until she fell asleep. 
        
       
       
        
        Between 1am and 1.40am on 10 August 2007, EMC woke to see the offender standing in the doorway of her bedroom. She asked what he was doing and he told her that that  
        [sic] 
         he had entered through her mother’s bedroom window. EMC went to the lounge room where she and the offender spoke. Shortly after she returned to her bedroom and the offender followed her. There she sat crying. 
        
       
       
        
        EMC said that the offender pushed her down onto the bed and placed a pillow over her face. She had difficulty breathing. The offender has denied doing this. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender then produced a knife and said words to the effect of ‘Oh, I could have used this, but I didn’t’. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender removed the smoke alarm from the ceiling and extracted the batteries. He then took an electrical cord and tied EMC’s legs with it. He then asked for her mobile phone to which she said, ‘Just take it’. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender took the phone charger and used the cable from it to tie EMC’s hands in front of her. She struggled to get free but fell to the floor, striking her head on the television cabinet. The offender then took a cord from EMC’s keys, put it around her neck and clipped it to her hands which were still secured in front of her. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender took a wire coat hanger from a cupboard and tied it around her feet so that she was secured with that and the electrical cord. EMC asked the offender to leave her alone but he did not reply. He put a sock into her mouth but she was able to spit that out, whereupon he put tissue paper into her mouth, which she was also able to spit out. He then took a shirt and put it over her mouth and tied it at the back of her head. He then placed a plastic bag over her head. 
        
       
       
        
        EMC reports that when he did this the offender said that if she told the police what he had done he would come back for her. The offender does not agree that he said this. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender then placed EMC on her bed and covered her with bedcovers. He left her in the bedroom and returned a few minutes later. She heard splashing noises elsewhere in the house and could smell petrol fumes. She heard the flicking noise from a cigarette lighter and the sound of a door banging shut. 
        
       
       
        
        In the course of submissions on 14 July 2008 I raised the question, from where did the offender access the petrol used to initiate this fire. I was told from the bar table that the petrol came from a shed and that it had been kept there by the owner of the premises. It was acknowledged that there was no evidence on the point but both parties asked the court to proceed upon the basis that the petrol came from the shed at the rear of the house. This is a relevant fact and reflects the measure of planning by the offender before he executed the crime. 
        
       
       
        
        EMC smelled smoke and was able to work her hands free and remove the bindings on her arms and legs. She escaped from the burning house through her bedroom window and raised the alarm. The police and fire brigade attended about 4.06am and found the house well involved in fire. There was considerable damage to the house and its contends. EMC was taken to hospital and treated for smoke inhalation. A number of marks were evidence on her wrists and legs left by the bindings applied by the offender. These were retrieved from the fire scene by investigators. 
        
       
       
        
        About 6pm that day the offender boasted to another two young men that he had blown up his girlfriend’s house. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender was arrested on 12 August 2007 and at the Tamworth Police Station he declined to be interviewed. He was charged, bail was refused, and he has been in custody since that time.” 
        
       
       
      (4) The offender’s personal background 
       
      
    16 The sentencing judge noted that the applicant was 16 years of age at the time of sentencing and observed that, “For one so young, he has an appalling record of offending” (Remarks on Sentence, p.13). His Honour recorded the applicant’s criminal history in detail and observed that, in relation to other offences, the applicant had previously been given the benefit of having been placed on bonds and control orders and that, at the time of the subject offence, he was on bail in respect of the offence of take and detain for advantage. 
     
      
    17 The Remarks on Sentence also record in detail the applicant’s family history including the fact that he was the youngest of five children born to a father who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. His parents separated in 1998 following which his mother formed another relationship with a man who drank excessively and was violent when intoxicated. The applicant had minimal supervision as a child and, ultimately, his mother relinquished care in October 2006. The sentencing judge referred to the futile efforts of police to have his mother attend in the applicant’s interests when he was detained. 
     
      
    18 The applicant was later placed in supportive accommodation but absconded and proceeded to develop a pattern of offending. He was bailed to reside with his sister and her partner at Bellingen but he again absconded and returned to the Tamworth area, rejoining his negative peer group “… to resume his drug taking” (Remarks on Sentence, p.24). 
     
      
    19 The sentencing judge later referred to the applicant’s wish to return to the Tamworth area “… which holds the attraction of his friends and the taking of drugs …” (Remarks on Sentence, p.24). 
     
      
    20 Reference was also made to the fact that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender has acknowledged that he has had these opportunities in the past but that his desire for drugs has influenced his decisions and contributed to his departure from the care of his sister. He claims to have been using cannabis 15 to 20 times per day and sniffing petrol. He will need ongoing alcohol and other drug counselling.”  
        (Remarks on Sentence, p.24) 
        
       
       
      (5) Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    21 The applicant relied upon seven amended grounds of appeal dated 25 September 2009. Written submissions were prepared on behalf of both the applicant and the Crown. At the hearing, Mr S Corish of counsel, who appeared for the applicant on the present application but not at the sentencing hearing, indicated that Ground 5 was not pressed. He did, however, seek leave to add a new Ground 5 based on a report of Dr K P Nunn dated 21 September 2009. I will return to this ground below. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in concluding that he should give “little weight” to the accounts and representations attributed to the applicant, as contained in reports tendered in evidence 
       
       
      (a) “Representations” and other accounts of the applicant’s drug issues 
       
      
    22 It is necessary to consider the scope of Ground 1 and, in particular, what the references in it to “accounts” and “representations” by the applicant include or embrace. This is necessary as there was no precise ruling as to what particular part of any report by way of “history” was excluded as evidence of fact. 
     
      
    23 In the Remarks on Sentence (p.3), the sentencing judge referred to reports tendered on behalf of the applicant and, in particular, to representations that had been attributed to the applicant “by health care professionals who have been called upon to provide reports”. His Honour stated that there was “no other evidence to support the histories and explanations to which they have referred and upon which they have relied, at least in part, for the opinions they offer”. 
     
      
    24 His Honour did not identify precisely which reports were being referred to or “the representations” to which the last-mentioned comment was directed. It may well have been intended only to refer to the statement(s) such as that made to Associate Professor Hayes that he had ingested specific quantities of marijuana on the day of the offence. 
     
      
    25 After quoting the observations made by Smart AJ in Regina v Qutami (2001) 127 A Crim R 369 at 377, the sentencing judge then stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There were reports tendered on behalf of the offender. The Crown consented to their admission but did not accept the reliability of the opinions that were offered. I admitted the reports but upon the limited basis that the representations attributed to the offender should be taken as evidence of the facts upon which the opinions of the authors were developed and not as evidence to prove the existence of a fact that the offender intended to assert by the representation. I propose to give little weight to the self-serving and untested statements attributed to the offender in those reports.” 
        
       
      
    26 The transcript of the sentencing hearing on 20 June 2008 records, under the heading “Case for offender”, the tender of particular reports by the legal representative then appearing for the applicant. The reports were marked, respectively, as Exhibits 1, 2, 3 and 4 and, in addition, documents subpoenaed from Juvenile Justice (Exhibit 5). 
     
      
    27 In relation thereto, the transcript records:-

         (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    28 The transcript records that, when Ms Seidler’s abovementioned report was tendered, the Crown representative stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Again your Honour, I have no objection. Your Honour when I say I have no objection, I don’t necessarily agree with the account received from the accused in either of those documents or any other documents that have been tendered as being accurate or indeed truthful. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well do you consent to the tender on the basis that the histories attributed to the offender are taken as to the facts upon which the opinions were formed rather than as to the truth of what he’s asserted. 
        
       
       
        
        HOLLES: Yes your Honour.” 
        
       
      
    29 Insofar as his Honour’s last-mentioned comment can be taken as a ruling, then it was to the effect that the two reports, Exhibit 1, which had already been marked “admitted without objection”, and, Exhibit 2, the report of Ms Seidler would be admitted upon that basis. 
     
      
    30 In relation to Exhibit 4, psychological report of Ian Nisbet, the transcript records Mr Holles for the Crown referring to it in these terms (at transcript, p.8):- 
     
      
       
        
        “I’ve not seen that report before I don’t think but I’ve no objection to its tender.”  
        
       
      
    31 Accordingly, there was no qualification on the tender of the report of 1 November 2007. 
     
      
    32 In relation to Exhibit 5, the transcript records the applicant’s legal representative referring to the tender of “five pages from that subpoenaed material …”. Mr Robert Carroll was noted as being the author of two of the documents and the remaining three documents were referred to as “Justice Health progress notes”. Included in the tender were notes of Dr Nunn dated 23 January 2008 and another of 15 February 2008. The Crown representative did not object to the tender in relation to the history provided by the applicant. The transcript records, in this respect, the Crown representative stating:- 
     
      
       
        
        “HOLLIS 
         [sic] 
        : Your Honour I don’t object to the tender, I don’t agree with any of the opinions contained.” 
        
       
      
    33 I have set out in some detail the basis upon which the reports and documents were received, as whatever the actual terms of any ruling, it was confined to Associate Professor Hayes’ and Ms Seidler’s reports. There was no objection to the documents comprising Exhibits 4 or 5, including the histories recorded in them. 
     
      
    34 Although not clear, it appears that the reference by his Honour to “the self-serving and untested statements attributed to the offender in those reports”, in context, was intended to refer to statements made by him that he had consumed drugs on the day of the offence. 
     
      
    35 In the discussion below, it is apparent that Mr Nisbet, Mr Carroll and Dr Nunn received relevant histories as to the applicant’s general substance abuse problem extending for a period of years. This was a matter relevant to the applicant’s subjective circumstances, and was separate and distinct from the question as to whether or not, on the day of the offence, he, in fact, ingested a quantity of drugs. It will be necessary to refer below in a little more detail to some of the recorded histories obtained by the last-mentioned health care professionals. 
     
      
       
      (b) Histories provided by the applicant  
       
      
    36 The sentencing judge referred to the need for caution in taking into account untested statements of prisoners to the authors of reports which are tendered in an offender’s case when the offender did not give evidence. His Honour commented on the fact that it was “regrettable” that the applicant had not given evidence and that “there is no other evidence to support the histories and explanations” referred to in the report.  
     
      
    37 Mr Corish submitted for the applicant that, although the generalisation regarding the exercise of caution remains valid, the rigour of the observation made in Regina v Qutami (2001) 127 A Crim R 369 at 377 should not apply to juveniles. As will be apparent from the discussion below, it is not necessary to express any final position on that question.  
     
      
    38 It was further submitted that his Honour was in error in dismissing the statements in the reports on the basis that “there was no other evidence to support the histories” (remarks on sentence, p.3). 
     
      
    39 If there was evidence that the applicant’s general psychological functioning had been dysfunctional up to the time of the offence and that substance abuse was a large part of that problem, such subjective circumstances had to be brought into account when determining sentence. 
     
      
    40 His Honour clearly declined to rely upon the applicant’s statements to Associate Professor Hayes, and in less precise terms, to Ms Seidler that he had consumed specific quantities of drugs on the day of the offence. His Honour was entitled to do so. However, any other evidence that established that the applicant was, at the time of his offending, a young person with a serious drug taking problem (a more general question), had to be considered and evaluated. There was, in fact, evidence to that effect. However, in my respectful opinion, it was not analysed for the purpose of fact-finding. 
     
      
       
      (c) Other sources of information or “accounts” as to the applicant’s drug taking 
       
      
    41 In relation to Ground 1, it is of some importance to identify the specific entries in the various file notes and reports which came into existence in the period between September 2007 and June 2008. The report of Associate Professor Hayes dated 22 April 2008, as previously mentioned, contained a statement or representation by the applicant that he had ingested between 10 and 15 cones of marijuana and some speed on the day of the offence. The earlier file notes and records in Exhibits 4 and 5 dealt with other matters, including what was said to be a lengthy history of drug taking by the applicant. There was, as earlier noted, no objection to those notes and records being received as evidence of the facts, based on the applicant’s accounts, of his past history. 
     
      
    42 Memoranda made soon after admission to the Reiby Juvenile Justice Centre recorded a serious history of drug taking by TC up to the date of the offence. They also refer to the fact that the consumption of “illicit substances” played a role in his “choices and actions”. The note of 19 October 2007 raised the question as to the possible role of his consumption of amphetamines in the offence.  
     
      
    43 The report of Ian Nisbet, psychologist, dated 1 November 2007, similarly confirmed a history of drug abuse by the applicant. This is described in the report (at pp.5 to 6) in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… He appears to have a lengthy history of substance abuse and many of his offences are alleged to have been committed while he was intoxicated. Continued substance abuse is a likely perpetuant  
        [sic]  
        of his offending.” 
        
       
      
    44 In the Department of Juvenile Justice note or memorandum dated 17 September 2007 in relation to “Ongoing Counselling”, there is a further acceptance of the applicant’s long standing drug abuse problem. There the comment was made:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… Positively [the applicant] is coming to realise the effects of drugs and alcohol on his lifestyle and life choices …  
        [The applicant]  
        has some culpability for his action and he is beginning to understand the role illicit substances play in his choices and actions.” 
        
       
      
    45 In a further Department of Juvenile Justice memorandum dated 19 October 2007, there is a note in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        [The applicant]  
        is currently adding abuse of solvents (petrol) and amphetamines to his list of used illicit substances: I have yet to investigate his latest AOD self report at depth, however, if in fact he was using these substances, it could well explain why  
        [the applicant]  
        did as he did. Such a causal chain would/could also guide the treatment modality.” 
        
       
      
    46 In relation to the various histories given by the applicant to the authors of the abovementioned memoranda and reports, three matters may be noted. Firstly, there is consistency in the histories provided. Secondly, the authors of the memoranda/reports identify the fact that the applicant’s substance abuse had operated over a period of years. Thirdly, the problem of the applicant’s drug abuse was identified as a factor, along with others, as having a correlation with his extreme level of behavioural dysfunction.  
     
      
    47 The sentencing judge was mindful of, and accepted that, the applicant, in fact, had a drug problem. He could hardly have done otherwise. There are a number of references by his Honour to the applicant’s history of drug taking in the Remarks on Sentence on particular matters. His Honour, at p.48, stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I find that there are special circumstances by reason of his age, by reason of  
        the need for ongoing management to address the use of drugs and alcohol 
         and to enable him to have the opportunity to gain some eduction. That process will begin in the custodial setting …”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    48 Earlier in the Remarks on Sentence (p.24), his Honour observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender has acknowledged that he has had these opportunities in the past but that his desire for drugs has influenced his decisions and contributed to his departure from the care of his sister. He claims to have been using cannabis 15 to 20 times per day and sniffing petrol. He will need ongoing alcohol and other drug counselling.” 
        
       
      
    49 His Honour proceeded to refer to the specific history of drug taking on the day of the offence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… at the time of the commission of this offence he had consumed 15 to 20 cones of cannabis and had been sniffing petrol. There is no evidence before the Court other than that representation. It is challenged by the summary of facts that informs the Court that prior to the offence he was at the house … where the victim had gone to have her evening meal. Moreover, the conduct of the offender, which I have itemised drawing from the facts, is inconsistent with any level of impairment as a consequence of the ingestion of drugs or any other substance.”  
        (p.25) 
        
       
      
    50 On the question of the role that drug taking by young offenders may take in the sentencing context, Wood CJ at CL in Regina v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [273] set out relevant sentencing principles. His Honour there observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(c) It may also be relevant as a subjective circumstance, in so far as the origin or extent of the addiction, and any attempts to overcome it might: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) Suggest that the addiction was not a matter of personal choice but was attributable to some other event for which the offender was not primarily responsible, for example, where it arose as the result of the medical prescription of potentially addictive drugs following injury, illness or surgery … or  
          where it occurred at a very young age 
          , or in a person whose mental or intellectual capacity was impaired, so that their ability to exercise appropriate judgment or choice was incomplete; …”  
          (emphasis added) 
          
         
        
       
      
    51 In the present case, the applicant’s long-standing problem with illicit drugs, whether it be properly described as an addiction or as chronic drug abuse, was clearly related to his extreme dysfunctional upbringing as recorded in the psychologists’ reports and other records in evidence. It clearly had been a very real problem for him for a lengthy period, and one that had to be taken into account as a relevant subjective circumstance when considering the appropriate sentence in accordance with the provisions of s.21A(1)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    52 The principle to which Wood CJ at CL referred in Henry (supra) has been referred to and applied by this Court in more recent times. In Regina v Todorovic [2008] NSWCCA 49, Hulme J referred to the conclusion of this Court in Henry (supra) which firmly rejected the proposition that, in general, addiction to drugs should be regarded as a mitigating factor. However, his Honour observed that the Court also there recognised that there would be cases where the general rule would not apply “… for example where the addiction was the result of youth or medical treatment over which the offender had no relevant control …” (at [58]). See also SS v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 114 at [102] per Price J, with whom Tobias JA and James J agreed. 
     
      
    53 Accepting, as I do for the purpose of the present appeal, that the sentencing judge was entitled to put to one side the specific statements made by the applicant to Associate Professor Hayes and Ms Seidler as to having consumed marijuana on the day of the offence, the sentencing judge was required to have particular regard to the fact, as established in other evidence, that the applicant’s substance abuse was a relevant matter for consideration on sentence, it having been an integral factor in his dysfunctional condition.  
     
      
    54 The sentencing judge was not assisted at the sentencing hearing in relation to these matters. The transcript confirms that there was a lack of focus in the submissions upon the applicant’s history of drug taking as a matter relevant to an evaluation of his subjective circumstances. The attention in the submissions was principally upon the specific “representations” or statements made by the applicant to the psychologists later in time (2008) as to his claim of having consumed substantial quantities of drugs on the day of the offence. In submissions, counsel then appearing for the applicant, after describing the applicant’s dysfunctional family and upbringing, explained that his client began “taking drugs and reported using marijuana, amphetamines and sniffing petrol” (transcript, 14 July 2008, at p.11). His Honour replied:-  
     
      
       
        
        “The only material before the Court regarding the suggestion that he’d smoked a large number of cones of cannabis on the day of the offence and had been sniffing petrol comes from the histories attributed to him I think by Professor Hayes.” 
         (transcript, 14 July 2008, p. 11).  
        
       
      
    55 Counsel agreed, though submitting that those reports as to the offender using substances appeared to be consistent with other reports contained elsewhere, and with his general background. However, that said, his Honour was not directed to the reports said to be consistent with a history of substance abuse. His Honour was understandably concerned about accepting the history of the smoking of cannabis on the day of the offence in the absence of confirmatory evidence. Counsel for the offender made a general submission to the effect that drug taking or intoxication could be relevant “to the background of the offending behaviour” (transcript, 14 July 2008, p.11). However, there was no other direct submission made as to the relevance of a history of drug abuse in determining the offender’s subjective circumstances.  
     
      
    56 In the circumstances to which I have referred above, there was no evaluation made of the question as to the extent to which the applicant’s pattern of serious drug abuse constituted a relevant subjective circumstance in determining the term of the sentence of imprisonment to be imposed. The applicant’s history in that respect was clearly relevant to the level of his culpability. I, accordingly, consider Ground 1 has been made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The sentencing Judge erred in failing to adequately take into account the applicant’s mental health condition 
       
      
    57 The applicant was diagnosed in January 2008 with a psychotic condition, namely, schizophrenia. That diagnosis was made by Dr Nunn. 
     
      
    58 The sentencing judge proceeded upon the basis that there was no evidence that the applicant suffered from such a condition at the time of the offence. Accordingly, he was sentenced upon the basis that the evidence did not support the existence of a mental or psychological disorder linked or causally associated with the offence. 
     
      
    59 The sentencing judge examined and recorded the Juvenile Justice background reports in some detail in his Remarks on Sentence, in particular, that of Mr Ian Nisbet, psychologist, the clinical psychological assessment report of Associate Professor Hayes and the psychological report of Ms Seidler. However, in the circumstances of this case, in my respectful opinion, his Honour was required, particularly with a young offender, to go further and determine whether the evidence established the existence of a psychological or psychiatric disorder and, if so, how it was to be taken into account for the purpose of determining an appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    60 As I have earlier indicated, the evidentiary material plainly established that, from a very young age, the applicant had an extremely disturbed and abnormal juvenile history. Whilst, as I have indicated, his Honour did refer to the history and analysis of the relevant reports, he did not express any conclusion as to the nature and extent of the applicant’s psychological status or condition and its relevance as a subjective factor in the sentencing process.  
     
      
    61 The applicant had been seen by a Dr McDonald of Tamworth and a psychiatrist, Dr J Miller, before the subject offence. He was prescribed at various times Zoloft (used to treat conditions such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, panic and anxiety disorders) and Ritalin (used for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders) and Dexamphetamine (also used for behavioural disorders such as attention deficit disorders). 
     
      
    62 Within a few weeks of the applicant’s arrest and prior to the Juvenile Justice memorandum of 19 October 2007, Dr Nunn, psychiatrist, altered the applicant’s medication to Olanzapine, an anti-psychotic medication used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. The memorandum referred to the applicant’s father’s “… significant schizophrenia history”. The progress note dated 23 January 2008 recorded that, by that date, he was not manifesting “psychotic phenomena” but that entry also records Dr Nunn’s conclusion “… I advised him today that he does have the same illness as his father viz schizophrenia”. It is clear that in the period between the time Dr Nunn first saw the applicant following his arrest and January 2008, he had been manifesting psychotic features. 
     
      
    63 Accordingly, the applicant had been treated for one or more psychological problems before the offence and was formally diagnosed within a few weeks of the offence with a psychiatric illness. The history before the offence indicated that he suffered for some time from ongoing emotional/psychological and other issues. Significant aspects of his history included the following:- 
     
      
       
      • Parental separation either when he was three or six years old and a family history of violence. 
       
       
      • Abuse and neglect. 
       
       
      • Initial exposure to alcohol at age five. 
       
       
      • Development of a pattern of binge drinking about three times a week. 
       
       
      • Initial smoking of cannabis aged six years. 
       
       
      • Development of drug abuse – cannabis – and in 2007 commenced taking amphetamines.  
       
       
      • History of hyperactivity, anti-social and impulsive behaviour, violence and aggression at school resulting in expulsions. 
       
       
      • Continual absconding from foster care and supportive accommodation. 
       
       
      • Self-harming and aggressive behaviour. 
       
      
    64 Ms Seidler summarised his history in the following terms (paragraph [43]):- 
     
      
       
        
        “In sum,  
        [TC] 
         appears to be a very under socialised young man, who has distorted views about appropriate behaviour and the use of violence. Despite some apparent potential,  
        [TC] 
         appears to be functioning at a low level intellectually and, consequently, lacks sophistication and the maturity with respect to his ability to self regulate and manage his behaviour.  
        [TC] 
         does possess some empathy and perspective taking skills and he is able to appreciate the consequences of his behaviour on others, however, this is generally overridden by his tendency to impulsivity and the normalisation of violence that is rife within his social and personal network.” 
        
       
      
    65 The sentencing judge, after noting the evidence on the above matters, limited his consideration to the causal question as to whether there was a link between the applicant’s dysfunctional condition and the offence. He did not, however, proceed to address the nature and significance of his psychological condition otherwise as a relevant subjective circumstance to be assessed in determining sentence. As the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [86] indicates, his Honour was required to do so. 
     
      
    66 The sentencing judge’s approach was, with respect, as I have stated, an unduly narrow one. His Honour stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The challenge in this matter, though, is that these general observations regarding the offender have not been tied to the specific misconduct with which I am dealing, and I  
        find it very challenging to come to a view that his limitations discussed are so causally related to what he has done on this occasion 
        , that the objective assessment of the gravity of the offending is to be mitigated to any significant degree.” 
         (Remarks on Sentence, p.37) (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    67 Similarly, at p.47 of the remarks on sentence, his Honour stated “There is no evidence of any psychosis leading to this offence”. 
     
      
    68 The sentencing judge, as has previously been noted, accepted the applicant’s history and his psychological deficits as recorded in the various reports. Psychological conditions, eg, depression, have been accepted as a form of mental disorder that may, depending upon the evidence, be taken into account in sentencing for an offence, even though such conditions have not been found to be causative of the offending. The relevant principles and approach were referred to by Simpson J in Regina v Benetiz [2006] NSWCCA 21 at [36] to [38] as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “36 As to the second passage, his Honour’s expressed understanding does not accurately reflect the law. For mental illness or a psychiatric condition to be relevant to sentencing it is not necessary that it be  
        the 
         cause of the commission of the crime. Indeed, authority suggests that it is not necessary that it be  
        a 
         cause of the crime. I refer to the decision of this Court in  
        R v Fahda 
         [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40] – [48]. There reference was made to a number of authorities of which the following are, on this issue, relevant. In  
        R v Letteri 
         (unreported, NSWCCA, 18 March 1992), Badgery-Parker J said: 
         
         
          
           
            
            ‘In each of those cases [which he had, in the preceding paragraph, cited], it appears that the mental illness or retardation was a factor inducing the commission of the offence  
            but that is not a necessary condition of the application of the principle 
            .’ (emphasis added) 
            
           
          
         
         
        37 In  
        R v Engert 
         (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 Gleeson CJ said: 
         
         
          
           
            
            ‘In truth, however, ... the question of the relationship, if any, between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence, goes to circumstances of the individual case to be taken into account in the application of the relevant principles.  
            The existence of such a causal relationship in a particular case does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence, any more than the absence of such a causal connection produces the automatic result that an offender will not receive a lesser sentence in a particular case 
            . For example, the existence of a causal connection between the mental disorder and the offence might reduce the importance of general deterrence, and increase the importance of particular deterrence or of the need to protect the public. By the same token, there may be a case in which there is an absence of connection between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence for which a person is being sentenced,  
            but the mental disorder may be very important to considerations of rehabilitation, or the need for treatment outside the prison system 
            .’ (emphasis added) 
            
           
          
         
         
        38 A mental disorder such as the applicant’s depression was identified by Gleeson CJ in  
        Engert 
         as being part of the circumstances of the individual case. Generally speaking, the well-known authorities indicate that mental disorder may be relevant to the assessment of the offender’s culpability and to the level to which it is appropriate to give greater or lesser emphasis to principles of general or specific deterrence: see also  
        R v Scognamiglio 
         (1991) 56 A Crim R 81;  
        Letteri 
        ;  
        R v Champion 
         (1992) 64 A Crim R 244;  
        R v Wright  
        (1997) 93 A Crim R 48.” 
        
       
      
    69 It is clear that the applicant had a multiplicity of psychological disorders (including hyperactive – impulsive disorder) associated with an assessed low average intelligence, a history of aggressive, and at times, self-harming behaviour and, as an inter-related factor, his substance abuse problem. I also note Mr Carroll’s report dated 19 October 2007 recorded Dr Nunn’s opinion that scores obtained on testing the applicant could “cloud” a diagnosis of anxiety disorder in favour of ADHD. 
     
      
    70 I am of the opinion that the sentencing judge was in error in confining consideration of the evidence bearing upon the applicant’s psychological condition to the question as to whether it was causative or linked to the offending behaviour. The applicant did have psychological or psychiatric problems and, on the authorities, his Honour was required to have regard to them in evaluating the subjective circumstances of the applicant at the time of offending. This, his Honour did not do. 
     
      
    71 I, accordingly, am of the opinion that Ground 2 has been made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in failing to adequately take into account the principles of sentencing in relation to juveniles 
       
      
    72 His Honour made reference to the decision of this Court in KT v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 51. His Honour, an experienced judge, was clearly aware and mindful of the relevant sentencing principles in relation to juveniles. 
     
      
    73 It was submitted for the applicant that, although his Honour referred to the principles, he did not apply them “in any meaningful way”: Written submissions for the applicant, paragraph [39]. 
     
      
    74 It was further submitted that what was required was a consideration of the principles as applied to the offence and the offender, although it was acknowledged “… that it would always amount to a difficult balancing exercise, given the seriousness of the offence and the age and troubling circumstances of the offender but it was necessary – and it wasn’t done” (Applicant’s written submissions, paragraph [40]). 
     
      
    75 I do not consider that there is any substance to this ground of appeal. It has not been demonstrated that his Honour failed to apply relevant principles to the particular facts of the case. Beyond the errors to which I have referred in relation to Grounds 1 and 2, I do not consider that Ground 3 has any substance. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The sentencing judge erred in finding the offence was aggravated by the use of an explosive: s.21A(2)(c)(a), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       
      
    76 I do not consider there is any substance at all to Ground 4.  
     
      
    77 It was argued that the sentencing judge erred in finding that the use of “an explosive in the form of petrol” was an aggravating feature. Whilst it was acknowledged that petrol is highly flammable, it was contended that his Honour erred in finding that there was an actual use of an explosive. 
     
      
    78 The ordinary meaning of the term “explosive” applies in the circumstances of this case to the use of petrol, a highly explosive substance when used in circumstances of it vaporising, as clearly occurred in the present case. 
     
      
    79 Accordingly, there is no substance to this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: Leave is sought to adduce further evidence relating to mental health status of the applicant, namely, the report of Dr Kenneth Nunn dated 21 September 2009, and the failure to permit the applicant to rely on this report would lead to a miscarriage of justice  
       
      
    80 As noted earlier, at the hearing on 24 September 2009, Mr Corish stated that he wished to rely upon the affidavit of Bryan Peter Dowe affirmed 22 September 2009, annexed to which was a copy of the report of Dr Kenneth P Nunn, Senior Consultant in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry dated 21 September 2009 upon two bases. Firstly, upon the basis that the report constituted fresh evidence for reasons said to have been articulated in the report. Secondly, on the usual basis in the event that this Court was moved to re-sentenced the applicant. The Crown objected to leave being granted for the report upon the first basis, that is, as fresh evidence. 81 Mr Corish stated that it was not the case that the applicant's legal representatives were not aware of the possibility or probability of Dr Nunn being able to provide a report containing a diagnosis. He said that the report was relied upon as fresh evidence “for reasons articulated in the report” (transcript, 24 September 2004, at p.2). In the course of his submissions, he stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""The difference (with) this report and the basis of this report is that it is only since the applicant has been in custody for a significant period of time that he has been able to maintain a regular relationship with the health care professionals for the purposes of making a concrete diagnosis but also establishing what is the appropriate regime in terms of medication because this report refers to the applicant being resistant to or an impaired capacity to metabolise the medication referred to and that he was being treated with prior to sentencing. This is the new component - one could not have established that impairment without him being in custody for a period of time under the care of health professionals."" 
        
       
      
    82 The amendment sought to the grounds of appeal to rely on a new ground five was allowed on a provisional basis, that is, subject to determination of the fresh evidence question. 
     
      
    83 The “fresh evidence” was said to be two-fold. The first is the definitive diagnosis made by Dr Nunn of the applicant’s schizophrenia. The second was the reference in Dr Nunn’s report to the applicant’s condition being resistant to medications prescribed for the condition. 
     
      
    84 I do not consider that Dr Nunn’s report dated 21 September 2009 should be admitted upon the basis that it constitutes fresh evidence on either of the two matters referred to in Mr Corish’s submissions. First, it is clear that there was evidence tendered at the sentencing hearing that established that the applicant suffered from schizophrenia. The report of Dr John Kasinathan, Consultant General & Forensic Psychiatrist, Adolescent Health, Justice Health dated 4 July 2008 (which became Exhibit G), stated that, by May 2008, Dr Nunn had diagnosed the applicant’s condition as schizophrenia (there is uncertainty, both on the reports of Dr Kasinathan and of Dr Nunn, as to how long before the offence the condition was operating.  
     
      
    85 As to the second aspect, Dr Nunn refers in his report to the chronic nature of the applicant’s treatment-resistant schizophrenia but does not state that he is untreatable. At p.5 of his report, he refers to the fact that the applicant is “partially responsive to current anti-psychotic medication” and the possibility of him being given a trial of what he refers to as the gold standard anti-psychotic clozapine. 
     
      
    86 The fact that there has been an apparent variation in the applicant’s response to anti-psychotic medications since Dr Kasinathan’s report does not provide a sufficient basis, on the facts of the present case, to warrant leave being granted to rely upon Dr Nunn’s more recent report as fresh evidence. It does not, in my opinion, establish an unforeseen permanent worsening of the applicant’s condition since the date upon which he was sentenced. The evidence in the report should be received as relevant on the question of re-sentencing 
     
      
      Ground 6: The sentencing judge erred in imposing a non-parole period of six years of which the last eight months was to be served in imprisonment as an adult 
       
      
    87 It was contended that the sentence imposed would have the effect that the applicant must be transferred to an adult prison for the last eight months of his non-parole period. 
     
      
    88 It was submitted that such a sentence would be counter-productive and unnecessarily punitive. It was submitted that the non-parole period should be reduced, at least to the extent that would permit the applicant to complete his confinement in juvenile detention. 
     
      
    89 By reason of the errors to which I have referred in relation to Grounds 1 and 2, I am of the opinion that this Court should intervene and re-sentence the applicant. 
     
      
    90 The sentencing which I propose below will have the effect that, if released upon the first date upon which the applicant becomes eligible for parole, the whole of the parole period will be served in a juvenile institution. 
     
      
    91 Accordingly, Ground 6 will not, in those circumstances, arise and, accordingly, it need not be considered further. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7: The sentence is manifestly excessive 
       
      
    92 It was contended that the head sentence of 12 years was excessive and was plainly unjust. It was said to be unjust because it was out of reasonable proportion to the circumstances of the crime and the offender. 
     
      
    93 This ground of appeal is to be dealt with having regard to the particular subjective circumstances to which Grounds 1 and 2 relate, namely, the applicant’s condition as a consequence of his drug addiction and, secondly, his mental condition as it existed at the date of the offence. Accordingly, the ground of appeal will effectively be subsumed by the approach now to be taken by this Court based upon the matters central to Grounds 1 and 2. 
     
      
       
      Sentence proposed 
       
      
    94 The applicant should be re-sentenced by this Court upon the basis determined by the District Court so far as the applicant’s plea of guilty and the finding of special circumstances are concerned. 
     
      
    95 It follows that the applicant is entitled to a 25% discount in respect of his plea of guilty and, by reason of the finding of special circumstances, the statutory ratio should be varied in accordance with s.44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    96 The report of Dr Nunn dated 21 September 2009 confirms that the applicant has suffered from a severe schizophrenic condition for several years being a condition which is independent of any substance abuse. This is so, even allowing for the possibility that it was precipitated by substance abuse. 
     
      
    97 The medical evidence establishes the applicant’s condition as a subjective circumstance to be taken into account in relation to the determination of the sentence to be imposed by this Court. It is, in particular, to be taken into account in determining the length of the non-parole period. The decision as to the granting of parole in due course will no doubt ultimately bring into account up to date specialist psychiatric medical opinion as to the applicant’ suitability for release upon the expiration of the non-parole period. 
     
      
    98 I consider that the subjective circumstances of the applicant discussed above require some amelioration of the sentence imposed in this case. Firstly, addiction that is attributable to circumstances that cannot be said to be attributable to the personal choice of an offender may be taken into account. In this case, the applicant’s drug taking and mental condition were, on the evidence, inter-related matters. Secondly, the applicant’s psychiatric condition, a form of mental illness, may, in accordance with accepted sentencing principles, mean that the call for denunciation and punishment may be reduced and may render the applicant an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration: Regina v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at ]33] to [34] per Sperling J with whom Grove and Dowd JJ agreed. Such principles should, in my opinion, be applied by reason of the particular facts of this case and indicate a need for the sentence imposed to be set aside and the applicant to be re-sentenced. 
     
      
    99 I am of the opinion, taking into account the matters to which I have referred, that the applicant should be sentenced to a non-parole period of five years commencing on 12 February 2008 and expiring on 11 February 2013 and thereafter to a parole period of six years to commence on 12 February 2013 and to expire on 11 February 2019. 
     
      
    100 Accordingly, the earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 11 February 2013. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    101 The orders I propose are as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (2) The appeal is upheld 
       
       
      (3) The sentences imposed in the District Court be quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant is to be re-sentenced to a non-parole period of five years commencing on 12 February 2008 and expiring on 11 February 2013 and thereafter to a parole period of six years to commence on 12 February 2013 and to expire on 11 February 2019. 
       
      
    102 Accordingly, the earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 11 February 2013.

     Peter Francis SIMPSON v REGINA 
     
     
      
    1 Latham J: I agree with Schmidt J.  
     
      
    2 Fullerton J: I agree with Schmidt J. 
     
      
    3 Schmidt J: Peter Francis Simpson seeks leave to appeal under s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against the severity of the sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Acting Judge Woods, on 12 September 2008, in relation to six charges in respect of which he entered pleas of guilty.  
     
      
    4 The six charges were: 
     
      
       
        
        the first sexual intercourse without consent, carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years, pursuant to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 and a standard non-parole period of 7 years;  
        the second sexual intercourse with a person between 10 and 16 years, carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 8 years, pursuant to s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act ;  
        the third sexual intercourse with a person between 10 and 16 years, carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years, pursuant to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act;  
         
        the fourth to sixth aggravated indecent assault (person under 16 years), carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years, in respect of each offence, pursuant to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act and a standard non-parole period of 5 years.  
        
       
      
    5 The applicant was also fined $500 in relation to a s 166 certificate in respect of a charge of possessing ammunition without a license. 
     
      
    6 After applying a discount of 25 per cent for the pleas of guilty, the individual sentences imposed for the six offences were: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The sixth - imprisonment for a term of 3 years, to commence on 5 June 2007 and to expire on 4 June 2010, with a non-parole period of 2 years, to expire 4 June 2009 
         
         
        The fifth - imprisonment for a term of 3 years, to commence on 5 June 2008 and to expire on 4 June 2011, with a non-parole period of 2 years, to expire 4 June 2010 
         
         
        The fourth - imprisonment for a term of 3 years, to commence on 5 June 2009 and to expire on 4 June 2012, with a non-parole period of 2 years, to expire 4 June 2011 
         
         
        The third - imprisonment for a term of 7 years 6 months, to commence on 5 June 2010 and to expire on 4 December 2017, with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months, to expire 4 December 2015 
         
         
        The second - imprisonment for a term of 7 years 6 months, to commence on 5 June 2013 and to expire on 4 December 2020, with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months, to expire 4 December 2018 
         
         
        The first - imprisonment for a term of 7 years 6 months, to commence on 5 June 2017 and to expire on 4 December 2024, with a non-parole period of 3 years, to expire 4 June 2020. 
        
       
       
      
    7 The partial accumulation of the sentences led to a finding of a special circumstance under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The applicant received an overall sentence of imprisonment for a term of 17 years 6 months, to commence on 5 June 2007 (the date the applicant was taken into custody) and to expire on 4 December 2024, with a non-parole period of 13 years, to expire 4 June 2020. 
     
      
       
      The Proceedings Below 
       
      
    8 Agreed facts were tendered on sentencing. The charges related to five victims. The first charge, sexual intercourse without consent, related to JR, then aged 16 years, which occurred between 9 July 2003 and 31 December 2003. The second charge, sexual intercourse with a person aged 10 years or over and under 16 years, which occurred between 1 July 2002 and 31 December 2002, related to JR’s brother, AR, then aged 13 years. The third charge, sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 16, while under the applicant’s authority, occurred between 12 April 2003 and 27 April 2003 while the applicant had been granted overnight care of AR, by his parents. It also related to AR, then aged 13 years.  
     
      
    9 The fourth charge, aggravated indecent assault, which occurred on 23 December 2006, concerned PG, then aged 15 years. The fifth charge, also aggravated indecent assault, which occurred between 1 January 2007 and 20 February 2007 concerned DM, then aged 15 years. The sixth charge, a further aggravated indecent assault, which occurred between 21 December 2006 and 25 December 2006, concerned ZG, then aged 12 years.  
     
      
    10 The agreed facts showed that the first, second and third charges concerned offences representative of other offences of a similar kind, committed in relation to both JR and AR. 
     
      
    11 There was a Probation and Parole Service Pre-Sentence report of 25 August 2008 in evidence; a risk assessment undertaken by Nathan Ratsep, Probation and Parole Officer Bathurst District Office; Victim Impact Statements in relation to the victim ZG; a Pre-Sentence Report prepared by the Department of Courts Administration, dated August 1992; a report of 27 April 1992, by the psychologist Mark Grant and a report of 17 July 2008, by the Forensic Psychiatrist Dr Bruce Westmore. The applicant did not give evidence. 
     
      
    12 The facts found by his Honour were that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""In 1998 the R family purchased a property at Cooks Gap near Mudgee for use as a weekender and holiday accommodation. They had two sons aged then eleven and nine years. The offender resided in the area and after meeting the R family he spent a great deal of time becoming friendly with the family and winning the trust and confidence of the parents. At the time the accommodation of the R family was spartan whereas the offender's house was equipped with modern conveniences. Because of this, and when they were there on school holidays and weekends the R family, and in particularly the two boys, would spend a lot of time at the offender's residence to watch TV, use the computer, play computer games and eventually to use the shower. The offender would purchase gifts for the boys and the boys would help him around the property and the offender allowed the boys to use his firearms. 
         
         
        In about 2000 the offender commenced making sexual approaches to the boys, first of all to J then to A. This included exposing his penis to them touching their genitals, placing his penis into J’s mouth and making him perform oral sex on him. The sexual contacts and acts continued over the years and in 2003 when J was sixteen years of age it led to the offender having penile anal sexual intercourse with him without his consent and knowing that he did not want to engage in such activity."" 
        
       
       
      
    13 This act of anal intercourse was the first offence with which the applicant was charged. His Honour considerably condensed what was contained in the agreed facts, which also recorded in detail two other sexual assaults of JR in 2000, when he was 12 and 13 years old. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""During these years J had been told to say nothing about what was happening and threats were made and J stated that he felt shocked and embarrassed about these contacts. After the 2003 incident J avoided going to the offender's property and became estranged from his own family. Meanwhile the offender had been engaging in sexual contacts activity with J's younger brother A. 
         
         
        From about 2002 the offender was touching A on the genitals and engaging in oral sex with A. A states that he was in shock at the beginning and unable to react. He allowed these things to happen over the years as he was told by the offender not to tell anyone. A said that the felt ashamed of myself, disgusted with himself and was too embarrassed to tell anyone."" 
        
       
       
        
          
        
       
      
    14 This was directed to the second offence charged, an act of fellatio, again very considerably condensing the detailed account of that assault given in the agreed facts, where other assaults were also outlined. One occurred a few days after the first assault of A and two more, in December 2002. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""This activity of masturbation and oral sex continued through 2002 and 2003. There was an occasion in 2003 where the two boys stayed overnight at the offender's house with the consent of their parents and the offender engaged in oral sex with A on that occasion. A stated that, ""I was worried what people might think about me if they found out and that made me feel really upset."" 
        
       
       
      
    15 This was directed to the third offence charged, which again considerably condensed the account given in the agreed facts. There a further serious assault which occurred about a month later was outlined, as were two more assaults, one the following January and another later in 2004. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""A's behaviour at school had deteriorated by August 2004 and when confronted by his parents A told them what had been happening. On 5 August Mr R telephoned the offender and told him that he knew what he had done and he was not to contact any member of the family. On 8 August the offender rang Mr R and said, ""I'm selling my house and I will give you money."" The offender said, ""Sorry, sorry."" The R family had no further dealings with the offender and it was not until 2005 that J revealed to anyone what the offender had been doing to him. 
         
         
        In 2005 the offender made friends with the M family. P and ZG are brothers and their cousin is DM. The offender knew Mr M through business dealings. He become trusted as a family friend and was often entrusted with the care and control of P and ZG and DM. Mr M did a lot of travelling through the state with his business so the boys were invited to stay at the offender's home in the Mudgee district. When the offender travelled he took one or other of the boys with him and would touch them in the groin area and grab at their penis and genitals through their pants. 
         
         
        In December 2006 PG was at the offender's home at Gulgong and the M's were away and the offender grappled with PG and forced his hand inside the boy’s pants and held his penis. The boy pushed the offender off and ran out of the house. P was aged fifteen years at the time.""  
         
        
       
      
    16 This event in December 2006 related to the fourth charge. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""Some time in January, February 2007 while DM was staying at the offender's home at Gulgong the offender placed his hand on the boy's penis and testicles from outside the pants. D was fifteen at the time and told the offender to get out of it."" 
        
       
       
      
    17 This related to the fifth charge. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""Sometime in December 2006 to January 2007 the offender travelled with the three boys to Walgett and while staying in a motel room the offender forced his hand down the front of Z's shorts and took hold of his penis, Z who was twelve years old at this time struggled with the offender and was able to escape his grip and ran from the motel room."" 
         
        
       
      
    18 This related to the sixth charge. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""In March 2007 both J and A made statements to the Police and then an investigation was conducted by Mudgee police and on 5 June the offender was arrested. At the time of arrest some ammunition was found in his house. The offender does not hold a shooter's licence to permit him to possess such ammunition.""  
        
       
       
      
    The Grounds of Appeal 
     
      
    19 The hearing of the appeal proceeded largely without reliance on the written grounds. Whilst Ground 1 of the written grounds as filed asserted manifest excess with respect to the sentence, including the non-parole period, imposed on the first count, that argument was abandoned, in my view sensibly so. It cannot be realistically maintained that forced anal intercourse with a boy of 16 years is not an offence of considerable gravity warranting a sentence of 7 years and 6 months, particularly in the light of the applicant’s past offending and the position of trust he occupied at the relevant time. Indeed, a non-parole period of 3 years would be inadequate if it were considered independent of the requirement to adjust the proportion because of the principle of totality. 
     
      
    20 The live issues on the hearing of the appeal concerned admitted errors made by the Judge as to the maximum penalty that applied with respect to counts 2 and 3, and a failure to determine the objective gravity of the aggravated indecent assault offences. Without that determination, the role played by the standard non-parole period in the imposition of sentence on counts 4, 5 and 6 could not be ascertained. The Crown acknowledged that some adjustment to the aggregate sentence was necessary, following re-sentencing on counts 2 and 3. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 : Error in the Application of the Wrong Maximum Penalty for Counts 2 and 3. 
      
    21 It was common ground that Woods ADCJ erred in the sentences imposed in relation to the second and third offences and that this Court must intervene to correct that error. The error flowed from written submissions on sentence provided by the Crown, in which it was submitted that the maximum penalties for these offences were 16 and 20 years respectively. The maximum penalties were in fact 8 and 10 years, respectively. Moreover, his Honour at no stage determined where these two offences lay within the range of criminality indicated by the relevant maximum penalty. 22 His Honour concluded that these offences, both involving fellatio on a thirteen year old boy, had to reflect the same starting point as that selected in relation to the first offence, namely a term of 10 years. Allowing a 25% discount for the plea of guilty, there was a resulting term of 7 years and 6 months on each count and a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months.  
     
      
    23 Those sentences suggest that objectively, these offences were considered less serious than the first offence and that the second offence was considered more serious than the third, given that his Honour came to the view that they should each attract a starting sentence of 10 years, when the respective maximum penalties, on his understanding, was 14 years for the first offence, 16 for the second and 20 for the third.  
     
      
    24 I accept that offences 2 and 3 are each objectively less serious than offence 1. However, I do not regard the second offence as more serious than the third. It is well settled that in assessing the objective seriousness of an offence such as this, the nature of the particular sexual assault in question must be considered - see the discussion in R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 Crim R 575 at [24]. Here, there was no relevant distinction between the nature of the sexual activity, albeit the surrounding circumstances varied. 
     
      
    25 The second offence involved the applicant masturbating and fellating AR. This was the beginning of a series of increasingly serious assaults, when AR visited the applicant's home between 1 July and 31 December 2002. The third offence occurred between 12 and 27 April 2003, at a time when AR had been left overnight in the applicant’s care by his parents. This offence occurred when the applicant climbed into AR’s bed and caressed his genitals, fellated him, masturbated and ejaculated over him and again fellated him. Plainly, the objective gravity of the third offence was greater than that of the second.26 Taking these factors into account, I would place the second offence well within the mid range. In the case of the third offence, it fell above the mid range of objective gravity. 27 There were a number of aggravating factors to be considered. The offences occurred while the applicant was on a Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act s 9 good behaviour bond in relation to an offence under s 527C of the Crimes Act (in relation to unlawful possession of property). The applicant had four prior convictions under s 61M of the Crimes Act and a conviction under s 78K (in relation to homosexual intercourse with a male person aged over ten years and under sixteen years). He had served a total sentence of 3 years and I month imprisonment commencing in 1992. These convictions disentitled the applicant to any leniency. 
     
      
    28 The applicant’s personal circumstances were that he was 58 at the time of sentencing, having had a troubled upbringing as the result of his father’s alcoholism and violence. He had married, but the relationship had broken down and he had separated from his partner. He had two children, but contact with them had been lost. There was psychological evidence tendered at the hearing below, suggesting that when imprisoned in respect of the earlier offence of homosexual intercourse with a male person aged over ten years and under sixteen years, the applicant was perceived to have shown remorse and good insight into his behaviour. He had undertaken some relevant courses. The subsequent offences showed that perception to have had no sound basis. 
     
      
    29 The first report from Dr Bruce Westmore referred to sexual contact with cousins as a ten year old and being fondled by a pastor at age 13 and later regular consensual sexual contact with an older male when aged 17. Dr Westmore recommended a sex offenders programme and that risk of re-offending could only be assessed when they were completed. He did not consider the applicant likely to be a paedophile, given the evidence of the victims’ secondary sexual development. He noted limited past counselling and recommended more, so that the applicant’s risk of re-offending could be assessed. Ms Young, a psychologist, assessed the applicant as in the moderate to high risk category for re-offending and also recommended further counselling.  
     
      
    30 Fresh evidence in the form of a further report from Dr Westmore was received without objection. This revealed more about the applicant’s sexual contact with men when aged 16 years and older, that there had been consensual participation in sexual activity from a younger age, and that there was an attempted rape when he was 18, which had led the applicant to attempt suicide. The applicant had also indicated a desire to undertake courses to stop re-offending.  
     
      
    31 Dr Westmore suggested that the applicant might have ‘ego-dystonic’ homosexuality and that such males could be educated through counselling to redirect their sexuality towards age appropriate peers, which could occur after they become more accepting of their sexuality. Such males rarely engaged in sexual activity with children, being more likely to have anonymous adult based homosexual activity, or less rarely, some contact with underage but teenage children. Dr Westmore recommended that the applicant attend a sex offender’s programme and that until he had completed such a programme, his levels of remorse, insight and capacity to change behaviours would not be fully understood and identified.  
     
      
    32 This evidence did not provide any sound basis upon which it might be concluded that the applicant is not likely to re-offend. As his Honour found below, there was but little in this material which could properly be given much weight by way of mitigation. Despite the punishment which was imposed in 1992 for an earlier similar offences and the courses undertaken while in custody, the applicant engaged in further sexual activity with children.  
     
      
    33 The applicant’s offences and what is reflected in the agreed facts suggest no real remorse or acceptance of the applicant’s wrongdoing. The second and third offences were committed in the context of a long, carefully orchestrated campaign of abuse of AR. 
     
      
    34 There was no issue that the applicant’s early plea should lead to a 25% utilitarian discount, as his Honour accepted. As I have explained, there was little else in the evidence which may properly be given much weight, so far as mitigation is concerned.  
     
      
    35 In fixing sentences, I have concluded that the appropriate starting point, to reflect all of the matters referred to, is a penalty of 5 years for the second offence, reduced to 3 years and 9 months after the 25% discount is applied. As to the third offence, I have concluded that the appropriate starting point is a sentence of 7 years, reduced to 5 years and 3 months after the 25% discount is applied. It will be necessary to return to these sentences when considering the appropriate aggregate sentence and non-parole period. 
     
      
       
        
       
      Ground 3: The Sentences in Respect of the s 61M Offences were Excessive. 
       
      
    36 The maximum penalty for each offence was 7 years, with a standard non-parole period of 5 years. His Honour observed that the statistics relied on suggested “a medium range” of 3 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years for these offences. His Honour appears to have adopted a starting point of 4 years for each offence, before applying a 25% discount for the early plea, to arrive at a sentence of 3 years and a non-parole period of 2 years, in each case. There was no reason given for the conclusion that the standard non-parole period should not be imposed, although inferentially, as was submitted for the Crown, his Honour’s starting point of 4 years, may reflect a view that the offences were each below the mid range.  
     
      
    37 On the agreed facts, it was submitted that the offences were each below the mid range, the fifth being at the very, very bottom of the range, albeit requiring a term of imprisonment. The other two offences, it was said, fell very close to the bottom of the range and did not require a significant custodial sentence, even having regard to the standard non-parole period. Further, it was submitted that each assault was of short duration, with no threats involved. In the case of the fourth and fifth charges, the victims were but days or weeks away from their sixteenth birthdays. In the fifth, the applicant had touched the victim’s genitals only on the outside of his clothing. His Honour’s reasons did not disclose whether these considerations were taken into account in coming to the same sentence in respect of each offence. 
     
      
    38 As was recently discussed again in Karl Eedens v R [2009] NSWCCA 254 at [24], a sentencing court must make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence in question with some specificity and a failure to do so may lead to the conclusion that the sentencing discretion has miscarried. In relation to these offences, his Honour did not indicate whether in his view they fell in the mid range, or below it. and did not explain the departure from the standard non-parole period. (See R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [117] to [120], discussed in Karl Eedens v R at [20] to [25]). 
     
      
    39 While his His Honour’s view acknowledged that the pleas of guilty justified a departure from the standard non-parole period, but that it was nevertheless relevant as a guide or reference point for a mid range case, that general observation was a meaningless observation, in the absence of a determination as to whether offences 4, 5 and 6 fell within that mid range.  
     
      
    40 While the fifth charge was plainly not as serious as the other two, they each occurred after the applicant’s offences against the other two victims had been uncovered. Still, the applicant did not desist, but looked for and found three other victims. He persisted until his arrest after his fifth victim revealed the applicant’s assault to a parent. During these offences each victim was in the applicant's company as a family friend. Two of the offences occurred while the victim was at the applicant's home and the other, while in a motel room alone with the applicant.  
     
      
    41 The fourth offence occurred despite PG’s protests. The applicant lay on top of him, holding him down, after PG had fallen to the ground. He forced his hand down the 15 year old’s pants and took hold of his penis. PG had to use all of his strength to push the applicant off, so that he could escape. The fifth offence occurred when the applicant placed the palm of his hand on DM’s testicles and penis, on the outside of his pants. The applicant laughed, but desisted, when DG told him to ‘get out of it, don’t do that’. 
     
      
    42 The sixth offence involved the applicant forcing his hand down 12 year old ZG’s pants and taking hold of his penis, while ZG struggled to escape his grip and run from the motel room, where they were alone together.  
     
      
    43 I am not persuaded that offences 4 and 6 can properly be characterised as falling below the mid range of objective gravity. In my view, the objective gravity of these offences more than justified a nominal starting point of 4 years imprisonment. I accept that the fifth offence is not a mid range offence. However, given the circumstances outlined above, the sentence ultimately imposed by his Honour for that offence is also not manifestly excessive. It follows that this ground of the appeal must be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The Total Sentence was Manifestly Excessive 
      
    44 It was submitted that, given the way in which the sentences for the fourth to sixth charges were structured, the degree of accumulation was excessive, resulting in an effective sentence of 5 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 4 years. It was also argued that insufficient weight was given to the evidence of the applicant’s sexual abuse as a child. 
     
      
    45 As to the latter factor, I am of the view that no error was shown in his Honour’s approach. The matter was not ignored, but the evidence was slight and not regarded as being of much weight, on the question of mitigation. As was observed in R v CDH [2002] NSWCCA 103, such abuse may be relevant to rehabilitation, but may not be regarded as an excuse. The weight given to the evidence before his Honour was well within his discretion.  
     
      
    46 Nor am I persuaded that the degree of accumulation for the fourth to sixth charges was excessive. The offences were committed at different times and involved three different victims. True it is that the aggregate non-parole period for these offences exceeded the statutory ratio by 3 months, but the relevant consideration is the proportion between the aggregate sentence for all of the offences and the aggregate non-parole period for all of the offences.  
     
      
    47 The total sentence must be reconsidered in light of the success on Ground 2. The offences occurred over some years, in circumstances where the applicant repeatedly abused his position as a family friend with respect to a number of victims. Some of the charges were representative of continuing and escalating abuse of JR and AR. Those offences included fellatio and penile/anal penetration without consent. During at least two of the offences the applicant was on a s 9 bond. He had a history of prior similar convictions. Specific deterrence is undoubtedly an important factor in sentencing this offender.  
     
      
    48 There is no question that a significant term of imprisonment must be imposed. As discussed in Vaovasa v R [2007] NSWCCA 223; (2007) 174 A Crim R 116 at [15], the sentences must be partially cumulative; otherwise the total sentence would fail to reflect the total criminality of the offences in question. They involve, as I have observed, six separate offences, involving five victims, as a part of an ongoing course of conduct. They were not isolated incidents. Children, including 16 year old teenagers, are entitled to grow up free from the dangers which sexual predators such as the applicant pose. The aggregate sentence must reflect a marked degree of general deterrence. 
     
      
    49 Taking all of these matters into account, I have concluded that the appropriate total sentence is one of 14 years and 6 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 10 years. An aggregate non-parole period of less than 10 years would fail to reflect the criminality inherent in these offences.  
     
      
       
       
      Orders 
       
      
    50 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The time in which notice of the application for leave to appeal be filed, is extended. 
         
         
        2. Leave to appeal is granted. 
         
         
        3. The appeal is upheld in part and the sentences imposed in relation to the first, second and third counts are quashed. 
         
         
        4. In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced as follows: 
         
         
          
          On Count 2 - a non-parole period of 2 years, to commence on 5 June 2010 to expire on 4 June 2012, with a balance of term of one year and 9 months, expiring on 4 March 2014.  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          On Count 3 - a non-parole period of 3 years, to commence on 5 June 2011 and to expire on 4 June 2014 with a balance of term of 2 years 3 months, expiring on 4 September 2016. 
           
           
          On Count 1 - a non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment to commence on 5 June 2014 and to expire on 4 June 2017 with a balance of term of 4 years 6 months, expiring 4 December 2021.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Daniel Forbes, pleaded guilty in the District Court to an indictment containing the following two counts: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, an offence under s 112(2) of the  
        Crimes Act 
         which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Facilitate boat re-birthing, an offence under s 154G of the  
        Crimes Act 
         which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 4 years. 
        
       
      
    3 He also asked the sentencing judge, when sentencing him for the first count, to take into account on a Form 1 five further offences. The first three offences were associated with that first count, and the last two offences with the second count. The five offences were: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Deemed larceny of a Ford F-100 utility (s 154A(1)(a) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ); 
        
       
       
       2. Stealing a Toyota Lite-Ace van (s 154F of the  
      Crimes Act 
      ); 
       
       
        
        3. Malicious damage by fire of that Toyota van (s 195(1)(b) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ); 
        
       
       
       4. Receiving a “Shark-Cat” vessel (s 188 of the  
      Crimes Act 
      ); 
       
       
        
        5. Receiving a “Sea-A1” runabout and trailer. 
        
       
      
    4 On the second count the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years, commencing on 20 March 2007, the date of his arrest. It must be said immediately that that sentence cannot stand. As I have said, the offence under s 154G of the Crimes Act 1900 carries a standard non-parole period, appearing in the Table to Div 1A of Pt 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Section 45 is the source of a court’s power to decline to set a non-parole period. However, s 45(1) provides that that power cannot be exercised in respect of an offence in the Table. For such an offence a non-parole period must be set: SGJ & KU v R [2008] NSWCCA 258, per Kirby J at [75] – [78].  
     
      
    5 On the first count, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years and 8 months, commencing on 20 June 2007, comprising a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months and a balance of term of the same length. This sentence was arrived at after discounting a starting point of 8 years by 20% for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. His Honour referred in his remarks on sentence to the Form 1 matters and it is clear that he did take them into account in arriving at the sentence on the first count. However, he did not follow the usual practise of expressly announcing that he was doing so when he passed sentence on that count. No point was taken about this by either party. 
     
      
    6 It will be seen that the sentence for the first count was accumulated by 3 months upon the sentence for the second count. The aggregate sentence, then, is imprisonment for 6 years and 11 months, comprising a non-parole period of 3 years and 7 months and a balance of term of 3 years and 4 months. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences.  
     
      
       
      Facts  
       
       
      Count 1 / offences 1 – 3 on Form 1 
       
      
    7 There was an agreed statement of facts. Put shortly, the first count alleges aggravated breaking, entering and stealing, being a “ram-raid” committed at Bowral in the early hours of 15 February 2007. The circumstance of aggravation is that the applicant was in company. Phone calls monitored by police revealed that the offence was planned by the applicant and a co-offender, Andrew Crowden. Other persons, whose identity is unknown, were also involved. Crowden was seen by the Crown as the ringleader of the group. 
     
      
    8 In preparation for the ram-raid, in the evening of 12/13 February 2007 a Ford F-100 utility was stolen at Annandale and a Toyota Lite Ace van at Newtown. These are the first and second offences on the Form 1. It will be noted that the charge in respect of the utility is deemed larceny under s 154A of the Crimes Act, while the charge in relation to the van is stealing under s 154F. No doubt, as will be seen, this is because the utility was abandoned at the location where the ram-raid took place but the van was later destroyed by fire.  
     
      
    9 The applicant and his father conducted a boat and jet-ski repair business at leased industrial premises at Mt Druitt. The vehicles were taken to those premises and later, with the assistance of others, he moved them to a property at Berrima leased by his parents. The seats in the rear of the Toyota van were removed, and it seems that electrical work was done on the fuel pump of the Ford utility.  
     
      
    10 In the early hours of 15 February 2007 the applicant, Crowden and the other unidentified offenders travelled to Bowral. A little after 2.30am the applicant rang 000 from a public phone box in Moss Vale. He said that he was a railway cleaner and that he had seen a group of young men climb onto the roof of a Harvey Norman store in Moss Vale, which is about 10 kilometres from Bowral. This was a planned diversionary tactic for the purpose of the ram-raid.  
     
      
    11 At about 2.40am the stolen Ford utility was driven through the security doors of Springett’s Arcade in Bowral by the applicant’s co-offenders. Extensive damage was caused to the arcade, requiring repairs costing more than $16,000. The vehicle was driven into a free standing ATM machine, shearing it from its mounting on the floor. The Ford utility was abandoned, and the offenders loaded the ATM machine into the rear of the Toyota van.  
     
      
    12 The van was then driven to the Berrima premises, where the applicant met his co-offenders. With his assistance, they used a grinder or grinders to cut the hinges from the ATM machine, opened it and removed the money from it. It contained roughly $54,500 and that money was not recovered. 
     
      
    13 Sometime thereafter, some of the offenders set fire to the van with the ATM machine still inside it. Both the van and the machine were destroyed. This gives rise to the third offence on the Form 1, maliciously damaging property by fire. The estimated value of the van, which was uninsured, was $3,500. The ATM machine was valued at $10,000.  
     
      
    14 It is not the Crown case that the applicant was directly involved in the theft of the utility or the van. It is accepted that he was not present at the arcade in Bowral when the ram-raid occurred, and the Crown is unable to say which of the offenders set fire to the van. The applicant was dealt with for all these matters as a participant in a joint criminal enterprise. 
     
      
       
      Count 2 / offences 4 - 5 on Form 1 
       
      
    15 In the early hours of 16 March 2007, Crowden and some other offenders stole a large twin hull (Shark Cat) boat parked on a trailer in a street at Kirribilli. The boat and trailer were valued at $36,000.  
     
      
    16 It was taken to the applicant’s industrial premises, which then were at St Marys. In monitored phone calls over the next couple of days, the applicant and Crowden were heard discussing the rebirth of the vessel. The two of them worked on it at the premises. On 20 March 2007, police executed a search warrant there. The names and identifying markings had been removed from the boat and it had been stripped of parts, including two outboard motors which had been mounted onto another boat owned by the applicant. 
     
      
    17 This is the basis of the second count, facilitating boat rebirthing, and the fourth offence on the Form 1, receiving the stolen boat. The applicant claimed to police that he had bought the boat from one of his customers a week previously. 
     
      
    18 On the same day police also executed a search warrant at the applicant’s home, where they found a 10 foot aluminium runabout boat and trailer. Inquiries revealed that this boat and trailer had been stolen from the Five Dock area late in February 2007. This gives rise to the fifth offence on the Form 1, receiving that stolen property.  
     
      
    19 Following the execution of those search warrants, the applicant was arrested. Interviewed by police, he denied playing any part in the offences, although he acknowledged his association with Crowden. He later admitted knowing that the runabout and trailer found at his home were stolen.  
     
      
       
      Subjective case  
       
      
    20 It is unnecessary in determining the application to examine the applicant’s subjective case in any detail. He was 29 years old at the time of the offences and is now 32. He has a significant criminal history, comprising offences of dishonesty and driving offences but containing nothing of the seriousness of those the subject of this application. He gave evidence, and the sentencing judge observed him to be articulate and intelligent. He had apparently been successful in business. The sentencing judge saw him as a person who was “not without substance”, and considered that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. To that end, he found special circumstances.  
     
      
    21 His Honour had before him a psychological assessment of Dr John Jacmon and a psychiatric report by Dr Bruce Westmore. Part of the history the applicant supplied to each of them was an account of his relationship with Crowden, including a violent and intimidating encounter with him when the applicant was 18 years old. To this matter I shall return.  
     
      
    22 In the light of that account, and after psychometric assessment, Dr Jacmon concluded that the applicant had experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression “at clinically significant levels”. Distress due to depression and anxiety, he found, was likely to have existed since Crowden came into his life. These conditions affect cognitive functioning, and Dr Jacmon considered that the applicant’s account of his involvement in these offences revealed “highly impaired judgment …” Dr Westmore thought that the violent incident the applicant described was “likely to have had a significant impact on him psychologically”, but added that he would need extended clinical contact with him “to identify clearly what effect that may have been”.  
     
      
       
      Sentencing judge’s findings 
       
      
    23 His Honour described the ram-raid as “well planned and well executed”, and “a major enterprise”. He noted that the applicant was “involved as part of the joint criminal enterprise and was heavily involved in the preparation of the vehicle to be used in the commission of the offence”. He had also assisted in breaking open the ATM machine. His Honour found that the offence was motivated by greed. He assessed its objective gravity as “just below” the mid-range.  
     
      
    24 The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. He adhered to the account he had given to Dr Jacmon and Dr Westmore that his involvement in the ram-raid and the rebirthing of the stolen vessel was the result of pressure from Crowden. His evidence was that at the age of 18 he met Crowden, who was a friend of his family. There was an occasion when he damaged a valuable item of property of Crowden’s. A few days later, Crowden retaliated by dragging him from under a car on which he was working and forcing him into the boot of it. Crowden drove the car to another location. There he stopped, dragged the applicant from the boot to the front of the car and forced him to his knees. He produced a gun which was unloaded, but the applicant did not know that. He put the gun to the applicant’s head and pulled the trigger. The applicant was so terrified he soiled his clothing. Crowden threatened him that if he interfered with any of his possessions again, the gun would be loaded next time. 
     
      
    25 The applicant’s relationship with Crowden endured, but this incident continued to traumatise him. In April 2006 he and his father commenced the business at the Mt Druitt industrial premises. According to the applicant, about a month later bikies came to the premises and demanded weekly payments of protection money. The applicant and his father saw no choice but to agree and, as a result, the business became unprofitable. The applicant’s father told Crowden about this, and later in that year Crowden spoke to the bikies and resolved the issue. In return, he demanded use of the industrial premises at night to work on vehicles which he had stolen. When the applicant said that he was not willing to do so, Crowden accused him of being ungrateful, punched him to the face and broke his nose. The applicant then agreed to his demand.  
     
      
    26 It is against this background, he said, that his involvement in these offences must be understood. In effect, Crowden demanded that he participate in the ram-raid, saying that he owed him a favour. It was Crowden who planned the offence, and his contribution to the preparation and execution of it was at Crowden’s direction. He did so because he was still afraid of him. For the same reason, he said, he did not go to the police. Crowden had earlier told him that his phone calls were being monitored by police, and he thought that if he spoke to Crowden about the offence over the phone the police might arrest him before it was committed. In that event, he hoped, he might avoid a custodial sentence and be able to sever his connection with Crowden. He was also concerned about Crowden’s influence on his brother, who was abusing illicit drugs and stealing to fund his habit, and he wanted to bring their association to an end.  
     
      
    27 His Honour referred to the submission that the applicant had been intimidated by Crowden since the age of 18, when the incident with the gun occurred, and said that it was “hard to put that together with Mr Crowden being a family friend”. That said, he made no express finding about either of the violent incidents which the applicant described, or about Crowden’s intervention in a problem he and his father had with bikies, but he does not appear to have rejected that evidence.  
     
      
    28 However, the applicant’s account of his involvement in these offences, particularly his evidence about the intercepted telephone calls, invites scepticism. Not surprisingly, it was the subject of some searching cross-examination by the Crown’s representative in the sentence proceedings. In the intercepted calls the applicant appears to be an active participant in planning the ram-raid, and their tenor does not betray any intimidation of him by Crowden. On the whole of the material, his Honour concluded no more than that there was “at least some degree” of the applicant “going along with the criminal activities of his friend”, and that “there was a degree of intimidation by Crowden of him to commit these offences”.  
     
      
    29 His Honour found that the boat rebirthing offence and the associated offence of receiving that vessel “were willingly committed” by the applicant, who “showed some delight in being rewarded by getting two stolen outboard motors”. This was a reference to an intercepted phone conversation concerning the two motors which had been removed from the stolen boat and mounted onto the applicant’s boat. In that conversation, which took place on 15 March 2007, the applicant agreed with Crowden that he was “rapt” with the motors and said to Crowden, in a jocular tone, “It’s about time you looked after me after all the shit I’ve done for you.”  
     
      
    30 In evidence, the applicant expressed remorse for the offences, as he had done to Dr Jacmon. However, his Honour was not convinced by that evidence, saying, “I do not think that contrition has been sufficiently shown.” This finding, together with his Honour’s finding about the extent to which the applicant had been intimidated by Crowden, were challenged in the application. 
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    31 There are three grounds of the application: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. His Honour failed to have regard to  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
        1999 and authority in dealing with offences carrying a standard non-parole period. 
        
       
       
        
        2. His Honour failed to assess and have proper regard to the applicant’s role in the joint criminal enterprise for the s 112(2) offence. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Each sentence was excessive such that other less severe sentences are warranted.” 
        
       
       
      The grounds are related, and the applicant also relies upon the sentence subsequently imposed upon Crowden by Walmsley DCJ.  
       
      
    32 Before considering each of the grounds, it is convenient to deal with the challenge to his Honour’s findings of fact and the approach of Walmsley DCJ to the sentence of Crowden. Counsel for the applicant, Mr Haesler SC, submitted that there was “no cogent basis” for rejecting what he had said in evidence, and what he had told Dr Jacmon and Dr Westmore, about Crowden’s intimidation of him and the influence that had exerted upon his involvement in the offences. Mr Haesler also argued that his Honour had failed to give proper weight to the opinions of Dr Jacmon and Dr Westmore on this issue.  
     
      
    33 It must be borne in mind, however, that his Honour had the advantage of observing the applicant as a witness. As I have said, whatever might be the truth of the history of the applicant’s relationship with Crowden, there were good reasons for his Honour to be guarded about his account of how he became involved in these offences. Any view expressed by Dr Jacmon or Dr Westmore was largely dependent upon the truth of what the applicant told them and, in any event, Dr Westmore’s assessment of the significance of the incident with the gun was at best tentative. His Honour gave the applicant the benefit of the qualified finding of a degree of persuasion or intimidation by Crowden, and that approach was clearly open. 
     
      
    34 Mr Haesler also submitted that it was not open to his Honour to have rejected the applicant’s expression of remorse. It is true that his Honour did not flesh out his reasons for doing so. However, again, he had the advantage of observing the applicant as a witness. Moreover, as the Crown prosecutor in this Court pointed out in written submissions, the applicant’s claim to be contrite stood to be weighed against his initial denial of the offences to police, his late pleas of guilty and, most importantly, his exaggeration of the extent to which his involvement was a result of Crowden’s influence. This finding also was open. 
     
      
    35 When Judge Walmsley sentenced Crowden, he was aware of the sentences passed upon the applicant but did not have his Honour’s remarks. In relation to the ram-raid, Crowden pleaded guilty to the same offence as the applicant and asked for the same three related offences to be taken into account on a Form 1. He also pleaded guilty to stealing the Shark Cat vessel. He was also dealt with for an entirely unrelated offence under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act (a home invasion), in respect of which two further offences were taken into account on another Form 1, including another offence under s 112(2).  
     
      
    36 For the offence of stealing the boat, Crowden was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 18 months, dating from 20 March 2007. For the unrelated offence under s 112(2), with the matters on that Form 1, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years, comprising a minimum term of 18 months and a balance of term of 18 months, commencing on 20 May 2007. For the ram-raid offence, with the related matters on the Form 1, he was sentenced to the same term as the applicant: imprisonment for 6 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months, in his case to date from 20 November 2007.  
     
      
    37 In the result, for the whole of the criminality for which he was to be dealt with, Crowden was sentenced to an overall term of 7 years and 3 months, with an effective non-parole period of 4 years. The applicant’s overall term, it will be remembered, was imprisonment for 6 years and 11 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 7 months. 
     
      
    38 Judge Walmsley saw the ram-raid offence as falling in the mid-range of objective gravity. The statement of facts in Crowden’s case recited his involvement in that offence and the related offences but did not assert that he was the ringleader, and his Honour saw no reason to differentiate between his role and that of the applicant. He imposed upon Crowden the same sentence as that of the applicant “because of the need for parity”. He noted that the offence of stealing the boat to which Crowden had pleaded guilty was less serious than the applicant’s offence of facilitating the rebirthing of that vessel, which carries a higher maximum sentence. This, no doubt, is why his Honour sentenced Crowden to 18 months imprisonment for that offence, while the applicant had been sentenced to 2 years for his offence.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1: offences carrying standard non-parole periods  
       
      
    39 As I have said, it is common ground that his Honour erred in failing to specify a non-parole period in respect of the 2 year sentence for the boat rebirthing offence. It will be necessary for this Court to intervene, if only to the extent of fixing a non-parole period. 
     
      
    40 However, Mr Haesler argued that his Honour also fell into error in arriving at the sentence for the ram-raid offence. His Honour considered that that offence, but for the plea of guilty, should attract a sentence of 8 years imprisonment. After the 20% reduction for the plea, he arrived in round figures at the sentence of 6 years and 8 months. He set the non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months having found special circumstances. 
     
      
    41 Mr Haesler argued that his Honour had failed to follow the process for sentencing for an offence carrying a standard non-parole period set out in Div 1A of Pt 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, in accordance with the principles enunciated by this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131, 60 NSWLR 168. The standard non-parole period for the offence is 5 years. Mr Haesler pointed out that, in the absence of special circumstances, that non-parole period would result in a head sentence of 6 years and 8 months, the sentenced passed upon the applicant. A head sentence of 8 years, again in the absence of special circumstances, would produce a non-parole period of 6 years.  
     
      
    42 However, as Mr Haesler observed, there were a number of reasons in this case to depart from the standard non-parole period in the applicant’s favour. His Honour had found that the objective gravity of the offence fell short of the mid-range. The applicant had pleaded guilty and had good prospects of rehabilitation. Mr Haesler also referred to evidence of the applicant’s contrition, but I have found that it was open to his Honour to reject that evidence. Reliance was also placed on what Mr Haesler described as the applicant’s “lesser and subsidiary role in the offence”, a matter to which I shall return when I deal with the second ground of the application.  
     
      
    43 Mr Haesler submitted that his Honour had not had regard to the standard non-parole period as a guidepost in arriving at the appropriate sentence, in the manner expressed in Way at [122]. Rather, he had “focused first on the head sentence and then made allowances for the plea and special circumstances when fixing the non-parole period”. At no stage, argued Mr Haesler, “did he stand back and assess the sentence imposed by reference to any finding about the objective seriousness of what the applicant did”.  
     
      
    44 In his remarks, his Honour did deal with matters capable of warranting a departure from the standard non-parole period, and he gave the applicant the benefit of a significant reduction of that period. Nevertheless, he did not expressly refer to the standard non-parole period and record his reasons for departing from it, as required by s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Nor does it appear that he had regard to the standard non-parole period as a guidepost in arriving at the sentence he did. However, the question for this Court is whether it should intervene on the basis that, for those reasons, the sentencing process miscarried.  
     
      
    45 The gravamen of Mr Haesler’s complaint is that, viewed against the standard non-parole period of 5 years for an offence in the mid-range of objective gravity where there has not been a plea of guilty, his Honour’s starting point of 8 years is demonstrably excessive. However, more than once, this Court has had occasion to consider the difficulty in sentencing for an offence under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act, given that it carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years and that it embraces such a wide range of criminality: see, for example, Marshall v R [2007] NSWCCA 24, per Howie J at [34] – [38]. In arriving at the starting point in the present case, his Honour was required not only to reflect the objective gravity of the ram-raid offence but also to take into account the five offences, themselves serious, on the Form 1.  
     
      
    46 Whether the sentence passed upon the applicant is manifestly excessive is a matter which I shall examine when dealing with ground 3. The matters the subject of this ground do point to a significant irregularity in the sentencing process, but whether they justify intervention turns on the question whether any lesser sentence than that which his Honour passed was warranted: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. To that question I shall return. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – the applicant’s role  
       
      
    47 Mr Haesler submitted that his Honour fell into error in failing to distinguish between the role of the applicant and that of Crowden in the ram-raid offence (and the Form 1 offences associated with it). In part, he pursued this ground on the basis that his Honour should have found that the applicant was intimidated by Crowden to the extent he claimed, but I have already determined that it was open to his Honour to arrive at the conclusion he did about that matter. Otherwise, Mr Haesler noted that in the statement of facts Crowden was described as the ringleader of the group. He also relied on Judge Walmsley’s approach to the sentencing of Crowden, although there was no separate ground relating to parity of sentence.  
     
      
    48 Both Mr Haesler and the Crown prosecutor referred to R v Goundar [2001] NSWCCA 198, 127 A Crim R 331, in which the Court considered the approach to sentence of co-offenders involved in a joint criminal enterprise. Wood CJ at CL, delivering the leading judgment, referred to R v Breedon (CCA, unreported, 3 December 1992), a case concerned with the same issue. The Chief Judge said at [31] – [33]: 
     
      
       
        
        “31. This Court approved the observation of the sentencing judge, when assessing the objective criminality of the offenders, as “being of the same quality” upon the basis that they had involved themselves “in a course of criminal conduct which could be described as a joint criminal enterprise”. 
        
       
       
        
        32. This does not automatically mean that every participant in such an enterprise shares the same degree of objective criminality. The assessment does, however, begin or should begin with the proposition that each intended the crime and each set out to carry it into effect. 
        
       
       
        
        33. On some occasions cause will arise for differentiation between them, for example, if one offender stands out as the obvious ring-leader, …” 
        
       
      
    49 In the present case, his Honour noted the Crown’s position that Crowden was the ringleader but did not distinguish his role in the planning and execution of the offence from that of the applicant. However, the statement of facts provided him with little or no basis to do so. It may be accepted that Crowden initiated the criminal enterprise. Nevertheless, as the Crown prosecutor pointed out in written submissions, the characterisation of Crowden as the ringleader “tells us very little about their respective roles, which had to be determined on the material before his Honour”. 
     
      
    50 It is apparent from a reading of his remarks that this is what his Honour did. He determined the applicant’s criminality upon an assessment of his role in the enterprise as it was disclosed by the statement of facts. Judge Walmsley took the same approach in sentencing Crowden, and it was open to him to find no basis to differentiate between the part played by each of them. There is, in truth, no inconsistency between the findings of the two sentencing judges. In the applicant’s case I can detect no error in his Honour’s assessment of his role in the criminal enterprise, and it does not appear to me that he has any legitimate complaint of injustice arising from Judge Walmsley’s approach in Crowden’s case.  
     
      
    51 The question remains whether the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance from the fact that for the ram-raid (and the associated Form 1 offences) he and Crowden received the same sentence. As I have said, Judge Walmsley did not have his Honour’s remarks on sentence in the applicant’s case. There was a minor difference between the two judges’ assessments of the objective gravity of the ram-raid offence, but this is of no moment. Presumably, Judge Walmsley was not aware that his Honour found the applicant to have been subjected to a degree of intimidation by Crowden and, if he had been, he may have seen some distinction between their criminality. 
     
      
    52 However, that was at best a limited finding in the applicant’s favour and it is not apparent how much weight his Honour gave it in determining the appropriate sentence. It does not appear to me to have been worthy of much weight, given the applicant’s active involvement in the planning and pursuit of the enterprise. It would not merit such disparity of sentence between the applicant and Crowden as to justify this Court’s intervention on that basis.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3 – manifest excess  
       
      
    53 Finally, Mr Haesler submitted that the sentence on each count is manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    54 He noted that the ram-raid was an offence committed at commercial premises after hours, rather than a home invasion. He referred us to five decisions of this Court in sentence appeals involving ram-raid offences, all of them committed at commercial premises: R v DBN [2005] NSWCCA 435, Douglas v R [2006] NSWCCA 94, R v Lenthall [2004] NSWCCA 248, R v Guthrie [2002] NSWCCA 77 and R v Ceissman [2004] NSWCCA 466.  
     
      
    55 With the exception of DBN, all those cases involved pleas of guilty. DBN was similar to the present case, in that a stolen vehicle was used and significant damage was caused to the premises and an ATM machine. However, the principal offence charged was aggravated break and enter with intent to steal under s 113(2) of the Crimes Act, carrying the lesser maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment. Also charged on the indictment were two counts of malicious damage and deemed larceny of a motor vehicle. On the major charge the sentence was imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years, and for the other charges shorter concurrent terms were imposed. 
     
      
    56 However, the offender was also charged with unrelated serious offences on a separate indictment, to which he pleaded guilty. Terms of imprisonment imposed for those offences were partly accumulated upon the sentence for the ram-raid, so as to produce an aggregate term of 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. An appeal against all these sentences was dismissed. 
     
      
    57 In Douglas, the charge was under s 112(2), with the deemed larceny of a motor vehicle taken into account on a Form 1. That applicant was a 20 year old offender who, although he had a criminal history and was on a bond at the time, impressed the sentencing judge as being genuinely remorseful and showed reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. His appeal against a sentence of 3 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months was dismissed. In Lenthall the applicant was charged under s 113(2), with some relatively minor offences of dishonesty taken into account on a Form 1. His appeal was allowed, and his sentence was reduced to 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 ½ years. He was seen as an offender genuinely “at the cross-roads”, and there was an issue of the relativity of his sentence to a much more lenient sentence passed upon a co-offender. 
     
      
    58 Guthrie and Ceissman were both Crown appeals. In each case this Court allowed the appeal and substituted a sentence of imprisonment for 6 ½ years with a non-parole period of 4 ½ years. In both cases offences were taken into account on a Form 1: in Guthrie’s case, two offences of possessing a firearm without authorisation and in Ceissman’s case, two minor offences of dishonesty. Both offenders had unfavourable criminal history, and Ceissman had been on parole at the time of the offence.  
     
      
    59 It will be noted that in three of the cases, DBN, Lenthall and Guthrie the ram-raid was charged under s 113(2). Moreover, in DBN the sentence passed for that offence was part of a complex of sentences for a series of offences, some of them wholly unrelated, and considerations of totality must have arisen. The most lenient sentences were those in Douglas and Lenthall, in which subjective considerations appear to have loomed large. No doubt, in passing sentence in Guthrie and Ceissman, the Court exercised the restraint appropriate when re-sentencing after a successful Crown appeal.  
     
      
    60 Importantly, in none of those cases were there the number and gravity of the Form 1 matters which had to be taken into account in the present case. In the context of emphasising the care with which sentencing statistics should be approached, Wood CJ at CL said in Lenthall at [47]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Additionally it is not to be overlooked that the comparison with the statistics is complicated where Form 1 offences have been taken into account, since that will require some increase in the sentence, for the reasons discussed in  
        The Attorney General’s Application Under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of  
        2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518. The extent of the increase will vary according to the number and nature of the offences included in the Form 1.” 
        
       
      
    61 It does not appear to me that these cases disclose a pattern of sentence such as might found a submission that the sentence for the applicant’s ram-raid offence is manifestly excessive. Given the care with which the enterprise was planned and executed, the substantial sum of money stolen and the damage to the arcade, this was a serious offence of its kind. Having regard to the Form 1 offences, it appears to me that the sentence which his Honour passed was within the legitimate bounds of his sentencing discretion.  
     
      
    62 Mr Haesler also argued that the applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance when his aggregate sentence is compared to that passed by Judge Walmsley on Crowden. He noted that Crowden’s aggregate sentence is only marginally greater than the applicant’s, despite the fact that Crowden was also dealt with for a series of offences unrelated to those in which he was involved with the applicant. However, the aggregate sentence in his case was the result of the fact that the sentences passed by Judge Walmsley were largely concurrent. Like DBN, the consideration of totality was important when dealing with him. It is not easy to mount a parity argument by reference to the global sentences passed upon two offenders when one of them was also sentenced for unrelated matters not common to them. I am not persuaded that a comparison of the global sentences passed upon the two men provides the applicant with any legitimate sense of grievance, so as to warrant this Court’s intervention. 
     
      
    63 Finally, Mr Haesler submitted, with less vigour, that the 2 year sentence on the charge of facilitating boat rebirthing is manifestly excessive. He noted that the applicant had pleaded guilty to that charge also, and that the offence “appears to be a one-off and not part of an organised business activity”. However, he also noted that this is an offence which has rarely been prosecuted and any pattern of sentence for it is yet to emerge. His Honour said that the applicant was entitled to a discount for what he saw as his early plea of guilty to that charge, but he did not quantify it.  
     
      
    64 Given the maximum sentence for the offence of imprisonment for 14 years, and the standard non-parole period of 4 years, it cannot be said that a sentence of 2 years for this offence is manifestly excessive. It should also be noted that it is almost entirely concurrent with the sentence on the first count. However, a non-parole period should have been set and this Court should now do so. I would set a non-parole period of 18 months. While there may be special circumstances, the structure of the sentences is such that there would be no utility in departing from the statutory ratio.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion and orders 
       
      
    65 Let me return, then, to the first ground, relating to the standard non-parole period in respect of the ram-raid offence. As I have said, there was irregularity in his Honour’s approach to that matter but, in all the circumstances, I am satisfied that no lesser sentence for that offence was warranted and this Court should not intervene. 
     
      
    66 Accordingly, in respect of the sentence on the first count I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. In respect of the sentence on the second count, I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. On that count I would re-sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 18 months, commencing on 20 March 2007 and expiring on 19 September 2008, and a balance of term of 6 months, commencing on 20 September 2008 and expiring on 19 March 2009.  
     
      
    67 McCALLUM J: I agree with Hidden J.

     GAGNER PTY LIMITED T/AS INDOCHINE CAFÉ v CANTURI CORPORATION PTY LIMITED 
     
     
      
     
     
     HEADNOTE 
     
     
      
       
       (This headnote does not form part of the Court’s judgment.) 
       
       
      Gagner operated a restaurant located above Canturi, a boutique jewellery store in the Sydney CBD. On 28-29 October 2005, the kitchen in the restaurant flooded and water escaped into the jewellery store below, causing damage to the store fit-out. Nevertheless, apart from several hours of being closed on the day the flood was discovered, Canturi continued to trade in the damaged shop for some months. Prior to the flood, the owner of Canturi had been in the planning stages of a complete refurbishment of the interior. As a result of the flooding, Canturi made the decision to completely refurbish, so as to avoid a lengthy closure and to be able to re-open in time for the Christmas shopping period. Canturi did not repair only the damaged portion of the store, to restore it to its previous condition, but refurbished the entire fit out. The refurbishment resulted in the parts of the store that had been flooded being different in various ways to how they had been before the flood. The judge awarded a sum of damages equivalent to the amount that would have needed to be expended to return the store condition to the state it was in before the flood. Canturi did not seek the full cost of the refurbishment it actually carried out. 
       
       
      That award of damages included an amount intended to reflect the quantum that would have been paid as GST on purchases that Canturi would have been required to spend to replace those items damaged in the flood (see para [25]). Canturi was registered for GST purposes, and thereby entitled to receive an input credit under the GST legislation for any payments of GST incurred on acquiring goods and services for the purpose of improving the appearance or usability of its shop. 
       
       
      The trial judge found that, although Canturi was considering a major refurbishment of its fit out, the decision to refurbish was not yet made, and that the flood caused Canturi to make the reasonable decision to carry out both the repairs and renovations at the same time. The store fit out was already at a very high standard. 
       
       
      Held 
        
      (per Campbell JA, Macfarlan JA and Sackville AJA agreeing): 
       
       
      Entitlement to recover damages 
       
       
      (1)  
      Entitlement to damage:  
      There was an entitlement in the circumstances to a measure of damages equal to the cost of what the restoration of the premises to their former condition would have been, even though the refurbishment actually carried out was more extensive. 
       
       
      (2)  
      Comparison with damages for breach of contract:  
      Discussion of case law concerning principles for assessment of damages for negligent damage to real property, and relationship of those principles to principles for assessment of damages for breach of contract by defective performance of building work. 
       
       
      The inclusion of GST on amounts to be paid during refurbishment in the quantum of damages 
       
       
      (3)  
      Operation of the GST Act:  
      The respondent would have made a taxable supply whenever it sold in the course of its business an item on which it would be obliged to pay GST, and would make a creditable acquisition for which it would receive a GST input credit when acquiring goods or services for the purpose of improving the appearance or usability of its retail shop: [135]-[142]. Under the GST Act, obtaining an input credit for GST paid on a creditable acquisition results in the payer effectively receiving back the amount of that input credit either as a reduction in its GST liability or an increase in its refund entitlement: [143]-[145]. Hence, for a person registered for GST purposes, payments of GST on goods and services which an award of damages was intended to cover would not be a loss suffered if the acquisition of those goods and services was a creditable acquisition by that person: [147]. 
       
       
      (4)  
      GST payments for which an input credit would be received to be excluded from quantum damages:  
      If a plaintiff in an action for tort is registered for GST purposes, and stands to receive an input credit for any GST payments incurred in making good its damage, and there is no impediment to the plaintiff receiving the full benefit of the input credit, that GST amount should be excluded from the quantum of damages recoverable, as it is not a loss suffered by the plaintiff: [151]. 
       
       
      (5)  
      Damages award itself not subject to GST:  
      As an award of damages is not considered to be a “taxable supply”, no allowance should be made in an award of damages for an amount of GST on the damages themselves. That is to be distinguished from a situation where the damages are for expenditure that would need to take place to make good the plaintiff’s loss: [157].

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA:  
     
      
       
      Nature of the Case 
       
      
    2 The Appellant operated a restaurant in leased premises on the first floor of a city building. The Respondent operated a jewellery store in leased premises in the same city building. The Respondent’s premises were located immediately below those of the Appellant. 
     
      
    3 During the evening of Friday, 28 October 2005 and the early morning of Saturday, 29 October 2005 water escaped from the Appellant’s premises and entered the premises of the Respondent, causing damage to some of the internal fit-out. In a judgment delivered in the District Court on 19 December 2008, JC Gibson DCJ found that the escape of water was caused by the negligence of people for whom the Appellant was vicariously liable. There is no appeal from that finding of liability. 
     
      
    4 Some grounds of appeal have been abandoned. The remaining grounds of appeal relate solely to the measure of the damages that the trial judge ordered the Appellant to pay to the Respondent.  
     
      
    5 The water damage caused the Respondent to lose some trading hours on Saturday, 29 October 2005. There is no dispute about the damages payable for those lost hours. The damage also gave rise to a need for some immediate drying out and cleaning up works, but the cost of those works has been met by the landlord. A computer belonging to the Respondent was damaged, and there is no dispute about the damages attributable to it.  
     
      
    6 The dispute arises from the fact that the Respondent did not have repair work done that brought the premises back into exactly the same condition they had been in prior to the flooding. Instead, it traded on in the premises, in their damaged condition, for over seven months. The Respondent closed the premises on 13 June 2006, and re-opened for business on 17 July 2006. As the business traded on six days a week, that closure was for 29 working days. 
     
      
    7 During the time the premises were closed there was a complete internal refurbishment of the premises, involving some internal reconfiguration. Only about 10% of the floor area of the premises became wet as a result of the flooding, but the whole of the premises was refurbished. In particular, without being exhaustive, an internal wall that had been damaged by the flooding was completely removed. Some vitrine cabinets, used for display of goods, were damaged and not replaced by an exact equivalent, though other means of displaying goods were incorporated into the refurbished premises. The flooded area had included part of a back-office area. Part of the back-office area was included in the part of the shop accessible to customers. The whole look of the premises was changed. The cost of the refurbishment actually carried out was substantially greater than would have been the cost of repairing the water damage in a way that would have brought the premises back to their pre-damaged condition.  
     
      
    8 The measure of damages that the judge allowed concerning rectification costs to the premises was, in broad terms, the amount it would have cost to bring the premises back as close as was possible to their undamaged condition (including goods and services tax (“GST”) on that cost), together with an allowance for 10 working days’ business interruption, at a daily rate that the parties had agreed. Ten working days was the time that the premises would have been closed if the Respondent had restored the premises as exactly as possible to their pre-accident condition. 
     
      
    9 The Appellant contends that the judge was wrong to assess the damages for damage to the premises in this way. It submits that, apart from the small items of damage concerning which the Appellant accepts it has liability, the action of the Respondent in embarking on a total refurbishment had the effect that it did not continue to suffer any loss in consequence of the tort, so far as making good damage to the fitout of the shop is concerned. 
     
      
    10 The grounds of appeal that had not been abandoned by the start of the hearing of the appeal were: 
     
      
       
        
        “(b) The respondent’s claim for rectification or repair costs was, in the circumstances, a claim for betterment. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) The refitting of the tenancy was not a mitigation of the respondent’s loss and damage. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The respondent’s damage should not have been quantified by reference to theoretical cost of repairing the confined water affected sections of the tenancy in circumstances where the respondent did not in fact replace the damaged sections to the same layout or design but rather replaced the fitout in its entirety to a new layout and new design, with new fixtures and fittings, and to a new ceiling layout. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) The respondent should not in the circumstances have been awarded as damages a theoretical 10-days of lost profits where that period was referable to the theoretical time that it would have taken to undertake repair works that, in the circumstances, were not in fact carried out and were rendered redundant by the replacement fitout to the new design and new layout. 
        
       
       
        
        (f) The respondent’s damages should not have included any allowance for GST on theoretical rectification costs in circumstances where no GST liability arose for the respondent or where any GST liability would have been revenue neutral for the respondent.” 
        
       
       
      Some Uncontroversial Facts 
       
      
    11 Mr Stefano Canturi has at all relevant times had practical control of the Respondent. The Respondent first occupied its premises under a five-year lease, the term of which commenced on 1 September 1998. It held over for several months at the end of that lease. On 1 March 2004, it began to occupy the premises under the terms of a seven-year lease. That lease conferred no right to an option.  
     
      
    12 Clause 18.1 of the lease obliged the Respondent to carry out certain refurbishment works: 
     
      
       
        
        “Within two (2) years except for any delay caused or contributed to by the Landlord from the Commencing Date the Tenant must, as an essential term of this Lease, carry out the Refurbishment Works at its own cost.” 
        
       
      
    13 The lease defined “Refurbishment Works” as meaning: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the refurbishment of the Premises and the shopfront in accordance with the Tenant’s corporate image and in accordance with the Landlord’s fitout guide for the Building which may include: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) new finishes to internal walls; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) new floor coverings; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) new signs and new lighting; and 
        
       
       
        
        (d) new shop fixtures, fittings and shopfront.” 
        
       
       
      The evidence did not include the  
      “Landlord’s Fitout Guide” 
      , nor was there any indirect evidence of the contents of that guide. While it could be said that the Respondent’s  
      “corporate image” 
       was of a retailer dealing in high quality goods at the expensive end of the market, the evidence does not permit any greater degree of precision about the Respondent’s  
      “corporate image” 
      . As paras (a)-(d) of the definition of Refurbishment Works listed only things that the refurbishment  
      “may include” 
      , it was not shown that carrying out work of the type listed in paras (a)-(d) was required by the clause.  
       
      
    14 Before the 2004 lease was entered the Respondent had obtained some drawings, from designers called Chrysalis, for both internal and external refurbishment of the premises. Those drawings were submitted to the landlord’s agent in February 2004. By letter of 15 March 2004 the landlord’s agent said that, “Generally the proposed design is acceptable”.  
     
      
    15 In November 2004, the Respondent paid a total of $4,458.30 for some new marble tops, and two showcases. In early 2005, the Respondent received the landlord’s approval to go ahead with some work involving modifications to the exterior of the premises. The work on the exterior was completed and paid for by 30 June 2005, at a cost of $27,313. The Respondent paid an additional amount of $19,800 in May 2004 for “repairs and maintenance for Sydney salon”. There was no finding that those works completely satisfied the Respondent’s obligations under clause 18.1, but neither was there a finding that they did not. 
     
      
    16 In August 2005 a different designer, Inset Group (Australia) Pty Ltd, produced drawings that the Respondent had commissioned for an interior refurbishment of the whole of the premises. Those drawings included three different options for the layout of the premises. Each differed in some respects from the drawings that had been produced by Chrysalis. 
     
      
    17 It will be recalled that the water damage to the premises occurred on 28/29 October 2005. On 4 November 2005, the Respondent obtained a quotation from Inset Group to repair the water damage. The amount quoted was $52,537.50 plus the standard rate of 10% for GST. Mathematically that would work out at $57,791.25. On 29 May 2006, the Respondent obtained a quotation from another builder to repair the water damage for an amount of $39,555 plus GST. Mathematically that would work out at $43,510.50. The May quotation was subject to some qualifications – it assumed that some wall studs were in a satisfactory condition, and warned that it might not be possible to obtain wall tiles exactly the same as some which had been damaged, which “may result in slight colour and texture variation”. Further, it was not a fixed price quotation, as some items had been allowed for on a provisional sum basis. Neither quotation was proceeded with. 
     
      
       
      The Judge’s Findings 
       
      
    18 The way the Appellant put its case on damages concerning the physical damage to the premises is summarised by the judge at [108]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The plaintiff not only had an obligation to replace the fittings under its lease, but had been planning a complete refit of the premises for some time … the plaintiff was always going to remove these fittings [that were damaged by the flooding] and … the plaintiff should not be entitled to compensation because, prior to their removal, some of these fittings fortuitously suffered damage by reason of the defendant’s negligence.” 
        
       
      
    19 The judge rejected the factual basis on which the Appellant put its damages case. At [115] her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I find that the plaintiff was indeed considering a major refit of the store to take place some time during 2006. While a part of this was because of the obligation to refit under the lease, this was at the bottom of the plaintiff’s list of reasons for carrying out a refit. The plaintiff was in the course of carrying out a major refit of all of its premises to present its wares to the top end of the market. This refit was far in excess of any obligations under the refit provision in the lease. It was while the plaintiff was planning this substantial refit that it made the unwelcome discovery of a flooding of its flagship jewellery shop at the busiest time of its trading, namely immediately before Christmas. As the analysis below of the competing estimates of damage will show, the impact of that flooding was, on any analysis, a cause of substantial damage. Clearly the damaged store fixtures and fittings had to be replaced. It would have been ridiculous for the plaintiff to make an insurance claim, shut its store for up to 10 days to carry out the work, only to carry out a substantial complete refit. Clearly, the plaintiff had to carry out repairs to the damaged premises whilst at the same time accommodating and adapting its plans for a total refit of the store. Had he closed its store twice, once for repair of the water damage and a second time for a total refit, this would not only have had a serious impact on its business, but require the plaintiff to do the same work twice within a short period of time, perhaps even a few months. Clearly the responsible and sensible way for any plaintiff mitigating its loss was to combine the two.” 
        
       
      
    20 At [141](e) her Honour rejected a submission that there was no causal connection between the closure of the store in June/July 1996 and the need to make good after the flood. She posed the question “Did Mr Canturi close the store for the renovations or did he close the store for both the repairs and renovations at the same time?” Her Honour’s answer to this question was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Canturi was frank and straightforward in his evidence on this issue. He made a pragmatic decision to carry out both the repairs and renovations at the same time. His concern was his store’s reputation as a top of the line jeweller, his need to be opened over the Christmas period, and his need to keep the period of downtime for his store to a minimum. While one of the factors may have been that he allowed an insurance [policy] concerning downtime to lapse, his principal concern was as the shop owner who did not want to have his shop closed unless it was absolutely necessary, and his conduct in keeping the premises open even on the day of the flood is indicative of this.” 
        
       
      
    21 At [158] her Honour declined to accept that before the flood the plaintiff’s fitout was nearing the end of its working life. She found that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the fit out was at a very high standard already … Mr Canturi was planning to update the corporate image but … both before and after the fit out, the plaintiff’s store’s image was that of a high-end jeweller.” 
        
       
      
    22 Her Honour rejected a submission that the flooding was not a cause of the refit because Mr Canturi had already decided, before the flooding, to carry out a full refit. She found, at [159], that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Canturi was considering a refit of the premises. However, these plans were far from being finalised. Mr Canturi said, and I accept, that his mind was always open and he was not committed to an expensive refit leading up to October 2005. He certainly had a refit of the store in mind, but the existing standard of the fittings and fixtures in his store can be ready appreciated from the photographs which had been tendered. The most likely result of the flood is that this was the last straw for him and it was following the flood that he committed himself to the expensive refit that he subsequently undertook during 2006.” 
        
       
       
      In reading that paragraph, it seems to me that her Honour was drawing a contrast between an expensive refit (of the type that the Respondent eventually decided on), and what might be called a mere refit.  
       
      
    23 At [161] the judge found that the damage precipitated a business decision on the part of the Respondent to carry out the refit “because it meant that the store would have to be closed for a period of time in relation to repairs. It was because Mr Canturi decided to close the store only once that he decided to include in his major refit repairs to the water damage.”  
     
      
    24 Her Honour found, at [163]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… What Mr Canturi is doing, on behalf of the plaintiff, over this period of time is clear; he is seeking to minimise the loss as best he can. It would be a mistake to read into Mr Canturi’s activities some kind of acknowledgment of a pre-existing intention to perform one or more of these tasks. Mr Canturi considered and discarded a number of plans before eventually deciding upon a total refit of the premises. This is reasonable and understandable behaviour from a person whose property has been damaged. The defendant’s concentration upon one or more of these proposed plans considered by Mr Canturi as evidence that the damage to the premises made no difference to Mr Canturi’s plans misses the point entirely.” 
        
       
      
    25 The elements of the material damage that her Honour allowed were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         1. Carpet 
          
           
           $16,665 
           
         
         
         2. Sandstone wall cladding 
          
           
           $10,000 
           
         
         
         3. Ceiling bulkhead and dry wall cladding repair 
          
           
           $3,700 
           
         
         
         4. Airconditioning 
          
           
           $1,600 
           
         
         
         5. Display vitrine units 
          
           
           $16,500 
           
         
         
         6. Painting 
          
           
           $2,500 
           
         
         
         New Sub-total 
          
           
           $50,965 
           
         
         
         Add preliminaries, margin and contingencies at 17.5% 
          
         
         
         Sub-total 
          
           
           $59,883.87 
           
         
         
         GST 
          
           
           $5,988.38 
           
         
         
         Total 
          
           
           $65,872.26 
           
         
        
       
      
    26 Each of these items was an item of a type that had been allowed by the Appellant’s expert, Mr Makin, as an item that would have been required to be spent if the water damage was rectified by restoring the premises to their pre-damaged condition. Her Honour altered Mr Makin’s figures for individual items somewhat, for reasons that she gave. There is no challenge on the appeal to those alterations.  
     
      
    27 In oral submissions Mr TGR Parker SC, counsel for the Appellant, made clear that the Appellant was not challenging any primary finding of fact that the judge had made. Para [26] of the Appellant’s written submissions had challenged a primary finding of fact, namely the judge’s finding that the fitout was not undertaken in consequence of the requirements of the provision in the lease concerning refurbishment. In my view abandonment of that particular challenge to the judge’s decision was well advised, as there were no facts that could be pointed to that provided a basis, consistent with Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; (2003) 214 CLR 118, for rejection of the judge’s finding. 
     
      
       
      Outcome 
       
      
    28 I am not persuaded that the Appellant has made out any of its challenges to the judge’s decision on quantum of damage, apart from the inclusion of the GST component of the material damages claim. Concerning the other grounds, I am not persuaded that the judge’s assessment is shown to be wrong. 
     
      
    29 In its submissions the Appellant dealt with the first four of its grounds of appeal together, and made separate submissions about the ground of appeal relating to GST. I will approach this judgment in the same way.

    30 It is elementary that the fundamental object of an award of damages for tort is to provide “that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured … in the same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation”: Livingstone v Rawyards Coal Co (1880) 5 App Cas 25 at 39 per Lord Blackburn; Butler v Egg and Egg Pulp Marketing Board (1966) 114 CLR 185 at 191 per Taylor and Owen JJ; Johnson v Perez (1988) 166 CLR 351 at 355 per Mason CJ, 367 per Wilson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ, 386 per Dawson J.  
     
      
    31 While the law has developed some conventional practices about the ways one applies that compensatory principle in particular fact situations, those conventional practices must yield if the facts of the instant case require some different method to be adopted for assessing the appropriate amount of compensation: Johnson v Perez at 355-6, 367, 386-7 (concerning the general rule that damages are assessed at the date of breach); Admiralty Commissioners v SS Chekiang [1926] AC 637 at 643 per Lord Sumner; Philips v Ward [1956] 1 WLR 471 at 473; [1956] 1 All ER 874 at 875-6 per Denning LJ; CR Taylor (Wholesale) Ltd v Hepworths Ltd [1977] 1 WLR 659 at 669; [1977] 2 All ER 784 at 793 per May J; McAllister v Richmond Brewing Co (NSW) Pty Ltd (1942) 42 SR (NSW) 187 at 193 per Jordan CJ.  
     
      
       
      Damages Awarded were “Theoretical”? 
       
      
    32 A repeated criticism that the Appellant made of the judge’s finding, was that the damages she had allowed were “theoretical”, because they related to the cost of work that had never actually been carried out, and the loss of trading time that would have been involved in carrying out that work.  
     
      
    33 One flaw in that argument is that there were some items, namely carpet replacement and painting, that appeared in both the damages allowed by the judge, and the cost of the work that the Respondent actually had carried out. While the vitrine cabinets were not replaced with identical objects, they were replaced with display facilities that were to some extent functionally equivalent. In the course of oral argument Mr Parker accepted that the Respondent could recover damages for what it had actually spent on the carpet, and on the painting. However, as will appear, in my view the criticism that the damages awarded were “theoretical” should be rejected in its entirety, not merely concerning these two particular items of damage. 
     
      
    34 We were referred to several cases concerning the damages recoverable from a builder or architect whose breach of contract had resulted in defective work being performed. The proposition sought to be established from those authorities (sometimes by arguing that an authority of apparent relevance was in truth not relevant) was that “if there were supervening events which meant that the rectification couldn’t take place, you couldn’t get damages on the basis that it would” (appeal tp 21). The application of that proposition in the present case was that the refurbishment works that the Respondent in fact carried out had rendered the precise work by reference to which the judge quantified the damages irrelevant, and thus it was wrong to quantify the damage in that way. The cases involved are Bellgrove v Eldridge (1954) 90 CLR 613; Director of War Service Homes v Harris [1968] Qd R 275; De Cesare v Deluxe Motors Pty Ltd (1996) 67 SASR 28; Central Coast Leagues Club Ltd v Gosford City Council (Supreme Court of NSW, Giles CJ Comm D, 9 June 1998, unreported); Hyder Consulting (Aust) Pty Ltd v Wilh Wilhelmsen Agency Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 313; (2001) 18 BCL 122; Scott Carver Pty Ltd v SAS Trustee Corporation [2005] NSWCA 462; Westpoint Management Ltd v Chocolate Factory Apartments Ltd [2007] NSWCA 253, and UI International Pty Ltd v Interworks Architects Pty Ltd [2007] QCA 402.  
     
      
       
      Bellgrove v Eldridge 
       
      
    35 Bellgrove v Eldridge is a case the Appellant referred to but distinguished. It concerned the proper measure of damages that a plaintiff could recover from a builder for breach of a contract to construct a house on the plaintiff’s land, when the builder had erected the house with such defective foundations that the house could safely be rectified only by demolition. In Bellgrove v Eldridge the plaintiff had retained the home, and no rectification work had been carried out at the time of the trial.  
     
      
    36 Dixon CJ, Webb and Taylor JJ held at 617-18, that the case before them could be distinguished from the situation where a purchaser of goods has accepted defective goods, in which the measure of damages is the difference between the value of the goods at the time of delivery and the value they would have had if they had conformed to the contract. They saw it as essentially different that the case before them involved, not the sale of a marketable commodity, but a contract for the erection of a building upon the plaintiff’s own land in accordance with particular plans and specifications. Their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… her damage is the loss which she has sustained by the failure of the appellant to perform his obligation to her. This loss cannot be measured by comparing the value of the building which has been erected with the value it would have borne if erected in accordance with the contract; her loss can, prima facie, be measured only by ascertaining the amount required to rectify the defects complained of and so give to her the equivalent of a building on her land which is substantially in accordance with the contract.” 
        
       
      
    37 Even concerning a departure from the contract that made the end product no less valuable, and that was purely a matter of taste rather than function (such as the specified colour the contract required a room to be painted) they held that the owner “is entitled to the reasonable cost of rectifying the departure or defect so far as that is possible.” 
     
      
    38 They held (at 617-18) that, subject to one qualification, the proper measure of damages was: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the difference between the contract price of the work or building contracted for and the cost of making the work or building conform to the contract, with the addition, in most cases, of the amount of profits or earnings lost by the breach.” 
        
       
      
    39 Their Honours held that if producing conformity with the building contract required the demolition of part, or even all, of the work, that was immaterial. The qualification, that their Honours expressed at 618-9, was that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… not only must the work undertaken be necessary to produce conformity, but that also, it must be a reasonable course to adopt. No one would doubt that where pursuant to a building contract calling for the erection of a house with cement rendered external walls of second-hand bricks, the builder has constructed the walls of new bricks of first quality the owner would not be entitled to the cost of demolishing the walls and re-erecting them in second-hand bricks. In such circumstances the work of demolition and re-erection would be quite unreasonable or it would, to use a term current in the United States, constituted ‘economic waste’. … We prefer, however, to think that the building owner’s right to undertake remedial works at the expense of a builder is not subject to any limit other than is to be found in the expressions ‘necessary’ and ‘reasonable’, for the expression ‘economic waste’ appears to us to go too far and would deny to a building owner the right to demolish a structure which, though satisfactory as a structure of a particular type, is quite different in character from that called for by the contract … 
        
       
       
        
        As to what remedial work is both ‘necessary’ and ‘reasonable’ in any particular case is a question of fact.” 
        
       
      
    40 The judgment makes no mention of whether the plaintiff did, or did not, intend to actually carry out the rectification work, or of whether that question was gone into at the trial. Their Honours said, at 620: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was suggested during the course of argument that if the respondent retains her present judgment and it is satisfied, she may or may not demolish the existing house and re-erect another. If she does not, it is said, she will still have a house together with the cost of erecting another one. To our mind this circumstance is quite immaterial and is but one variation of a feature which so often presents itself in the assessment of damages in cases where they must be assessed once and for all.” 
        
       
      
    41 Insofar as the damages were assessed as a sum that had not actually been expended, and might never be expended, it could be said that that sum was “theoretical”. 
     
      
       
      Present Irrelevance of  
      Bellgrove v Eldridge 
      ? 
       
      
    42 Mr Parker submitted that the present case is not governed by Bellgrove v Eldridge, because Bellgrove was a case concerning damages for breach of contract, while the present case involves the measure of damages for tort. He submits that there is a clear difference between the principles upon which damages for breach of contract are assessed, and those on which damages for tort are assessed. The objective of compensation for breach of contract is to put the plaintiff into the situation it would have been in had the contract been performed, while the objective of damages for tort is to put the plaintiff into the situation it would have been in had the tort never been committed. 
     
      
    43 These submissions are correct. Further, the passages that I have quoted from the reasoning of the court in Bellgrove v Eldridge show how that reasoning is closely tied to it being damages for a breach of contract that were being assessed – the court was seeking to ascertain the quantum of the sum of money that would make up to the plaintiff for the failure of the defendant to perform the contract. The matters to which Mr Parker points, are sufficient to show that Bellgrove v Eldridge does not bind me in the sense that it provides a precedent that is indistinguishable from the present case. They are not, however, sufficient to show that Bellgrove v Eldridge does not provide useful assistance in deciding the present case. 
     
      
    44 Deciding to what extent Bellgrove v Eldridge might provide assistance requires an examination of the issues the court had to decide in that case. The trial judge had assessed damages on the basis that the High Court ultimately upheld, of the cost of rectification. The first issue for the High Court was whether to accept the submission, recorded at 616, that the proper measure of damages was the difference between the value of the house and land in its defective condition, and the value it would have had if the house had been erected in accordance with the contract. The reasoning from Bellgrove v Eldridge that I have set out above was directed to that issue. There was another issue of fact, not presently relevant, that the High Court decided by holding that replacement of the foundations, rather than a cheaper underpinning solution, was a reasonable course to adopt. The present case is not one where the decision presented for this Court is a choice between loss of value and cost of restoration as the appropriate measure of damages. Even so, I later conclude that the manner in which the High Court quantified the appropriate amount to allow for the cost of restoration provides relevant assistance in the present case. 
     
      
       
      Harris  
      and  
      De Cesare 
       
      
    45 Director of War Service Homes v Harris and De Cesare v Deluxe Motors were both cases involving measure of damages for breach of contract for defective building work, in circumstances where the landowner who had entered the contract for performance of the building work had sold the land by the time of trial without having effected any rectification work. In each case the court followed Bellgrove v Eldridge, and came to the result that the damages allowed were assessed on the basis of how much it would have cost to rectify the defects.  
     
      
    46 It has sometimes previously been pointed out that in Harris the plaintiff had rectified the defects for the purchasers, after completion of the sales, and it has been argued that thus Harris does not represent an example of a case where the rectification would never be carried out. However, it was not suggested in Harris that the plaintiff had any obligation to the purchasers to rectify those defects, or even that it did so as a matter of business prudence, such as to protect its reputation. Rather, on the reasoning that was adopted in Harris, the fact that the rectification had occurred seems to be irrelevant. Thus, both these cases appear, at first sight, to be examples of a court awarding damages assessed on a basis that is “theoretical”. 
     
      
    47 In Harris at 278, Gibbs J (with whom Stable and Hart JJ agreed) held that the fact that the building had been sold was no reason why the measure of damages laid down by Bellgrove v Eldridge should not be applied, and gave this reason for so doing: 
     
      
       
        
        “When the builder, in breach of his contract, delivered to the building owner a building that did not confirm to the specifications, the owner became entitled to recover damages according to the measure approved in  
        Bellgrove v Eldridge 
        . If the owner subsequently sold the building, or gave it away, to a third person, that would not affect  
        his accrued right 
         against the builder to damages according to the same measure. The fact that the building had been sold might be one of the circumstances that would have to be considered in relation to the question whether it would be reasonable to effect the remedial work, but  
        assuming  
        that it would be reasonable to do the work the owner would still be entitled to recover as damages the cost of remedying the defects or deviations from the contract (assuming of course that the contract price had been paid). In assessing those damages it would not be relevant whether the owner was under a legal liability to remedy the defects, or whether he had made a profit or a loss on the sale of the building, for the builder has no concern with the details of any contract that the owner might make with a third party.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    48 Gibbs J held, at 280, that the repair of the houses was a reasonable course for the plaintiff to have adopted, so the assumption he had made at 278 was made out. 
     
      
    49 At 279, Gibbs J explained how the builder’s liability to pay damages could continue even after the other contracting party had sold the building: 
     
      
       
        
        “The owner of a defective building may decide to remedy the defects before he sells it so that he may obtain the highest possible price on the sale; he may sell subject to a condition that he will remedy the defects; or he may resolve to put the building in order after it has been sold because he feels morally, although he is not legally, bound to do so. These matters are nothing to do with the builder, whose liability to pay damages has already accrued.” 
        
       
      
    50 It is understandable that, in 1968, a judge could have held that the innocent party involved in a breach of contract had an accrued right to receive damages in a particular amount as soon as the breach had occurred. Even as at August 1979, the date to which the 14th edition of McGregor on Damages stated the law (page (ix)) it was possible for that well-regarded text to say, at [499]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is in complete accord with principle that damages should be calculated in contract at the date of breach and in tort at the date of determination of loss even if the loss, contractual or tortious, is a loss incurred in a foreign currency.” 
        
       
      
    51 The certainty of that principle concerning the time as at which damages are assessed has now been eroded. For example, in Johnson v Perez at 355-6, Mason CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is a general rule that damages for torts or breach of contract are assessed as at the date of breach or when the cause of action arises. But this rule is not universal; it must give way in particular cases to solutions best adapted to giving an injured plaintiff that amount in damages which will most fairly compensate him for the wrong he has suffered: see  
        Johnson v Agnew 
         [1980] AC 367, at pp 400-401;  
        Miliangos v Frank (Textiles) Ltd 
         [1976] AC 443, at p 468;  
        Dodd Properties Ltd v Canterbury City Council 
         [1980] 1 WLR 433, at pp 450-451, 454-455, 457; [1980] 1 All ER 928, at pp 933, 937, 939;  
        County Personnel Ltd v Alan R Pulver & Co 
         [1987] 1 WLR 916, at pp 925-926; [1987] 1 All ER 289, at p 297.” 
        
       
       
      Wilson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 367 are to similar effect.  
       
      
    52 Dodd Properties Ltd v Canterbury City Council [1980] 1 WLR 433; [1980] 1 All ER 928, a case relied on by Mason CJ in this passage and also cited by Wilson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 367, was a case similar to the present one in that it involved tortious damage to the plaintiff’s property. The question of as at what date the damages should be assessed arose because the effecting of restoration was delayed, and it was held that it was commercially reasonable to defer effecting the restoration, and the damages allowed were the cost of restoration at the later date.  
     
      
    53 Mr Parker reminded us of the endorsement in Kizbeau Pty Ltd v WG & B Pty Ltd (1995) 184 CLR 281 at 292-4 of the appropriateness of courts taking account, in assessing damages, of any events that have occurred between the time of accrual of the cause of action and trial that bear upon the damage that a plaintiff has actually sustained, and the preferability of relying on facts rather than prophecies to assess damages. See also Golden Strait Corporation v Nippon Yusen Kubishika Kaisha [2007] UKHL 12; [2007] 2 AC 353. 
     
      
    54 It follows that, even though a cause of action for breach of contract has accrued at the time the breach occurs, it cannot now be said that there is an accrued right at that time to receive any particular sum of damages. That is because it must await the trial to decide what is the most appropriate way, in light of events then known, to give effect to the compensatory principle of damages.  
     
      
    55 In De Cesare at 35, Doyle CJ said of the passage that I have cited from Harris at 278 that “what is said there may be expressed in terms that are too absolute”. I would go further and say that, to the extent to which the reasoning is based on the existence of an “accrued right … to damages” calculated in a particular way, it is reasoning that can no longer be supported. That does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the result in Harris was wrong, merely that, if it is right, a different route to that conclusion would nowadays need to be found. 
     
      
    56 Both the fact that Harris was a case involving breach of contract rather than tort, and the fact that its reasoning based on “accrued right to damages” cannot now be accepted in relation to either contract or tort, provide a reason why Harris is distinguishable from the present case. 
     
      
    57 In De Cesare, the plaintiff had rectified some of the defects before sale at its own cost, and Doyle CJ was prepared to infer that the sale price had been depressed by the existence of the remaining defects, so the plaintiff had clearly suffered some loss by reason of the defects. In applying the “necessary and reasonable” qualification of Bellgrove v Eldridge, Doyle CJ regarded the appropriate time (or, perhaps, an appropriate time) as at which to consider the reasonableness of rectifying the defects was before the building was sold. He said (at 32): 
     
      
       
        
        “This is not a case in which one can say, in my opinion, that it would have been unreasonable for the building owner to carry out the necessary remedial work before the building was sold. Nor does the sale of the building without that work being done suggest that.” 
        
       
      
    58 Later, he said (at 35): 
     
      
       
        
        “The performance of that work, and a claim for the cost of doing it, does not cease to be reasonable because the building has been sold. The fact that the building owner in the present case no longer intends to carry out the work throws no light on the reasonableness of doing so. The reasonableness of doing so is to be judged, in a case like this, objectively and does not depend in any way upon an inquiry as to the likelihood of the work in fact being done.” 
        
       
      
    59 When his Honour said that the reasonableness of doing the rectification work “does not depend … upon an inquiry as to the likelihood of the work in fact being done” he was not, as I read it, intending to say that the likelihood of the work in fact being done was totally irrelevant to an enquiry about the reasonableness of doing it. I say that because earlier in his judgment (at 33) he had quoted with approval the statement of Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle in Ruxley Electronics & Construction Ltd v Forsyth [1996] 1 AC 344 at 359 that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Intention, or lack of it, to reinstate can have relevance only to reasonableness and hence to the extent of the loss which has been sustained. Once that loss has been established intention as to the subsequent use of the damages ceases to be relevant.” 
        
       
      
    60 Doyle CJ also said (at 34) that Lord Lloyd of Berwick in Forsyth “also saw intention as relevant to reasonableness.” 
     
      
    61 The judgment of Nyland J in De Cesare (with which Bollen J agreed) arrived at the same conclusion by application of Bellgrove v Eldridge, without consideration of the complexities that Doyle CJ’s judgment took into account. Nyland J (at 41) distinguished the case before him from Forsyth on the ground that in it:  
     
      
       
        
        “… substantial performance had been achieved because the difference in value between the pool which had been the subject of the contract and the pool received was in effect nil. Accordingly, it would have been unreasonable to ask for reinstatement.” 
        
       
      
    62 He noted (at 42) that in the case before him “There had not been substantial completion of the contract prior to [the builder] going into liquidation.” Both the fact that De Cesare was a contract case, and this emphasis in the majority reasons of the importance of substantial completion of the contract provide, in my view, sufficient reason for concluding that I could not safely decide the present case simply by following De Cesare.  
     
      
       
      Central Coast Leagues Club 
       
      
    63 Central Coast Leagues Club was an action brought by the Club against the architect who had designed certain building work at the Club’s premises and the Council that had approved it. Giles CJ Comm D (as his Honour then was) found that the architect had breached its contract (at 111, 205-6) and had been negligent (at 116, 208), while the Council was liable in negligence (at 209-10). After the work was complete the Club came to be subject to an obligation, arising from orders of the Land and Environment Court, to rectify some of the deficiencies that the judge found to exist. His Honour found that to the extent that rectification work was not required by the orders of the Land and Environment Court, in fact the Club would not carry out the rectification work (at 217). The Club relied on Bellgrove v Eldridge, and in particular the passage at 620, to establish that it was entitled to damages quantified by reference to the costs of rectification. The judge rejected that submission at 216-7: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not think that the passage in  
        Bellgrove v Eldridge 
         would be in point if there were a finding of fact that the cost of the rectification work would never be incurred. In the assessment of damages once and for all, that finding of fact would remove any ground for the relevant compensation. On the reasoning in  
        Ruxley Electronics & Construction Ltd v Forsyth 
         [1996] 1 AC 344 at 354, 357-9, 372-3 (including citing with approval  
        Tito v Waddell (No 2) 
         [1977] Ch 106 at 332), once a loss has been established, intention as to the subsequent use of the damages is immaterial, but that the rectification work will never be undertaken means that there is no loss. In  
        Bellgrove v Eldridge 
         it was said (at 618) that awarding the reasonable cost of rectifying defective work was subject to the rectification work being a reasonable course to adopt, and that the work will never be undertaken gives occasion to conclude that it is not a reasonable course to adopt. So in  
        Alucraft Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v Grocon Ltd (No 2) 
         [1996] 2 VR 386, where four years had passed since the subcontractor’s defective work but the proprietor had not complained about it and had issued a final certificate, it was held that it would be unreasonable to award the contractor the cost of rectification because it did not intend to rectify the works and would probably not be called on to do so (see especially at 396). (Compare  
        De Cesare v Deluxe Motors Pty Ltd  
        (1996) 67 SASR 28, where the building owner’s damages included rectification costs although he had sold the building without carrying out the relevant rectification; the decision can be justified on the basis that it was assumed that the defective work had a depreciatory effect on the value of the building, see at 32, 35-6, but here the Club eschewed damages measured by loss in value of the premises).” 
         
        
       
      
    64 Several judges (Hodgson JA in Scott Carver Pty Ltd v SAS Trustee Corporation at [39], Giles JA in Westpoint Management Ltd v Chocolate Factory Apartments Ltd at [62] and Williams JA in UI International Pty Ltd v Interworks Architects Pty Ltd at [22]) have spoken of Central Coast Leagues Club as being a case where the rectification work would not be carried out because other more extensive work had to be carried out in order to comply with later court orders. In my respectful view that is a mistaken account of the facts of the Central Coast Leagues Club case – the finding was that to the extent that the works were not required to be carried out by the court orders they would not be carried out at all. The mistake is of no significance to the result in Scott Carver, UI International or Westpoint, but it needs to be recognised that Central Coast Leagues Club really was a decision to the effect that, in a situation where the plaintiff still retained, and was likely to continue to retain, the defective premises, and was also likely to do nothing to rectify the defects, damages equal to the cost of rectification were not recoverable. 
     
      
    65 However, though the passage I have quoted from Central Coast Leagues Club at 216-7 on its face appears to provide some support for Mr Parker’s present contention, that passage cannot now be relied upon, as it has later been qualified by its author and the course of subsequent appellate decision, as will appear below. 
     
      
       
      Hyder Consulting 
       
      
    66 In Hyder Consulting, an architect had been found liable for breach of a contract with its client. The breach was in failing to pass on to an engineer the client’s instructions about an increase, beyond that which had originally been intended, in the load that a particular pavement in industrial premises was required to bear. The engineer designed the pavement to withstand the originally-intended load, in consequence of which, comparatively soon after it was completed, the pavement failed in use.  
     
      
    67 The owner did not effect a total replacement of the failed pavement. Instead, as part of a major redevelopment of the site, it replaced part of the failed pavement with new pavement of the ultimately required strength, and constructed a new building over the remainder of the site of the failed pavement. That new building had a concrete slab floor of lesser load-bearing capacity than had been ultimately required, and was cheaper to construct than pavement of the load-bearing capacity that the client had ultimately required.  
     
      
    68 The trial judge allowed as damages $566,560, which was the amount it would have cost to replace the entire failed pavement with a new pavement of the ultimately-required strength, minus the additional costs that would have been involved in constructing a pavement of the ultimately-required strength. The damages so awarded exceeded the amount that the owner had actually spent when it actually replaced the failed pavement.  
     
      
    69 This Court reduced the damages to the amount actually spent in rectification. The reason of Meagher JA at [19] was: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems almost too simplistic to point out the actual cost was an impeccable alternative method of calculating cost. The owner’s counsel suggested that the $566,560 figure was mandated by the High Court’s decision in  
        Bellgrove v Eldridge 
         (1954) 90 CLR 613 at 617-8. In my view, this is simply not so. The ratio of that case is that where the price of rectification is ascertained, that price cannot be discounted because of the fact that the plaintiff will not, or might not, spend all the money on the rectification in question.” 
        
       
      
    70 Giles JA (with whom Sheller JA agreed on this point) said (at [99]-[100]): 
     
      
       
        
        “This does not mean that a theoretical reasonable cost is to be preferred over the actual cost where the actual cost is known and can be taken as the reasonable cost. If the rectification work has not been carried out, then a theoretical reasonable cost must be found and, because damages must be assessed once and for all, must be awarded even though the rectification work might not be carried out. (I have held that, if it is found that the rectification work will never be carried out, no damages should be awarded: see  
        Central Coast Leagues Club Ltd v Gosford City Council 
        , 9 June 1998, unreported). But if the rectification work has been carried out and the actual cost is known, that provides sound evidence of the reasonable cost and should ordinarily provide the basis for damages. 
        
       
       
        
        In neither  
        Director of War Services Homes v Harris 
         [1968] Qd R 512 nor  
        De Cesare v Deluxe Motors Pty Ltd 
         (1996) [67 SASR 28;] 13 BCL 136 was the actual cost of the rectification work known. The buildings had been sold, and while in  
        De Cesare v Deluxe Motors Pty Ltd 
         some money had been spent on rectification work there had not been proper rectification. It was held in both cases that the reasonable cost of rectification could still be the measure of the former building owners’ losses.” 
        
       
      
    71 In UI International at [22], Williams JA said of this case: 
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        Hyder  
        the rectification work in question could not be carried out because other more extensive work had already been carried out. In consequence Giles JA held that as the rectification work would never be carried out no damages should be awarded.” 
        
       
       
      With respect, that is not an accurate account of the facts, the result, or the reasoning process. 
       
      
    72 In both Hyder Consulting and the present case, work had been done that could be called rectification work in a loose sense, in that it resulted in the premises no longer being defective, but that work was not rectification work in a more precise sense of doing exactly what was needed to make good the contractual shortcoming (in Hyder Consulting), or to get the premises back as close as was possible to their pre-accident condition (in the present case). In both cases, it could be said that therefore the rectification work (in the more precise sense) would never be carried out. However, the result in Hyder was not consistent with the result that the Appellant urges in the present case, namely that the Respondent receive nothing for its material damage (or, as Mr Parker conceded in oral argument, only the costs of painting and carpet). Rather, the result in Hyder was that the plaintiff received only the amount it had spent on rectification, in the loose sense. Further, it received that amount notwithstanding that at least part of the amount awarded was the cost of doing work that, while it was rectification in the loose sense, involved construction of something quite different to that which had been the subject of the original contract.  
     
      
    73 To the extent that the damages allowed a component that was the cost of constructing something that was not rectification in the precise sense, it allowed damages that were “theoretical”. Giles JA expressly contemplated at [99] that when rectification work had not been carried out, an award of damages could be made that was a “theoretical reasonable cost”. Further, those “theoretical” damages were allowed in circumstances where, because of the rectification work that had actually been done, rectification in the precise sense would never be carried out. I respectfully agree that it was right in principle to calculate the damages in that way. 
     
      
    74 An important difference between Hyder Consulting and the present case, apart from the fact that Hyder involved a claim for damages for breach of contract, is that, in the present case, the costs of the rectification work (in the loose sense) that the Respondent has carried out exceed what would have been the cost of the rectification work (in the precise sense). When the Respondent has actually rectified the damage, in the loose sense, it is consistent with the result in Hyder that a “theoretical” measure of damages be allowed, provided it does not exceed the cost of the rectification work (in the loose sense) that has actually been carried out.  
     
      
       
      Scott Carver 
       
      
    75 Scott Carver Pty Ltd v SAS Trustee Corporation concerned some defective building work, in relation to which SAS (the owner at the time the work was carried out) sued the architect and various other entities involved in the work. The action was for breach of contract (at [32]). After the defects had been discovered, but before they had been rectified, SAS sold the building to a related entity for a price that explicitly made a deduction for the estimated costs of rectifying the defects. A referee found that the defects had caused no diminution in value of the property. A Master adopted the referee’s report, and (as summarised by Hodgson JA at [31]): 
     
      
       
        
        “… held that SAS was entitled to the costs of rectification of the defects, because rectification for those costs would be reasonable, and it did not matter that the defects did not reduce the value of the property or that the property had been sold.” 
        
       
      
    76 That decision was challenged in this Court, on the basis of the remarks in Central Coast Leagues Club and Hyder Consulting that I have earlier quoted. The challenge failed. Hodgson JA at [40] said of the proposition that “if it is found that rectification work will never be carried out, no damages should be awarded” that he had “some reservations”, “if it is taken unqualified and out of context”. One was (at [41]-[42]), in essence, that it was inconsistent with the decision in De Cesare. Another was (at [44]) that whether the rectification work would be carried out was a matter of future fact “which according to Malec v JC Hutton Pty Ltd (1990) 169 CLR 638 should generally not be decided in an all or nothing manner on the balance of probabilities.” 
     
      
    77 Ipp JA and Bryson JA each had their own reasons for upholding the award of damages, so no clear ratio emerges from the case. 
     
      
       
      Westpoint Management 
       
      
    78 In Westpoint Management v Chocolate Factory Apartments, Giles JA (in a judgment with which McColl JA and I agreed) accepted, at [62], the reservations that Hodgson JA expressed in Scott Carver v SAS. He said, of his comment in parenthesis in para [99] of Hyder, quoted at para [70] above,  
     
      
       
        
        “… my words were apt to mislead; it is necessary to ask why the rectification work would never be carried out.” 
        
       
      
    79 In Westpoint Management, after an extensive review of the authorities, Giles JA concluded, at [60]-[61]: 
     
      
       
        
        “But the plaintiff’s intention to carry out the rectification work, it seems to me, is not of significance in itself. The plaintiff may intend to carry out rectification work which is not necessary and reasonable, or may intend not to carry out rectification work which is necessary and reasonable. The significance will lie in why the plaintiff intends or does not intend to carry out the rectification work, for the light it sheds on whether the rectification is necessary and reasonable. Putting the same point not in terms of intention, but of whether or not the plaintiff will carry out the rectification work, whether the plaintiff will do so has significance for the same reason, and not through the bald question of whether or not the plaintiff will carry out the rectification work. That question is immaterial, see  
        Bellgrove v Eldridge 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        So if supervening events mean that the rectification work can not be carried out, it can hardly be found that the rectification work is reasonable in order to achieve the contractual objective: achievement of the contractual objective is no longer relevant. If sale of the property to a contented purchaser means that the plaintiff did not think and the purchaser does not think the rectification work needs to be carried out, it may well be found to be unreasonable to carry out, the rectification work. An intention not to carry out the rectification work will not of itself make carrying out the work unreasonable, but it may be evidentiary of unreasonableness; if the reason for the intention is that the property is perfectly functional and aesthetically pleasing despite the non-complying work, for example, it may well be found that rectification is out of all proportion to achievement of the contractual objective or to the benefit to be thereby obtained.” 
        
       
      
    80 The factual situation being addressed in Westpoint Management was that a developer sued a builder and project supervisor concerning defects in building work that those defendants had either carried out or supervised. By the time of the action all the units in the development had been sold, there was no evidence of any purchaser seeking to have the alleged defects in the building work rectified, and a referee had found that “there was clear evidence that if [the developer] recovered money for the alleged breaches, it did not propose to remedy most of them, but rather to pay the money to its shareholders” (at [28]).  
     
      
    81 As the appeal related to a trial judge’s adoption of a referee’s report concerning the claims for damages, the focus of the judgment was on whether the referee’s report showed legal error. Giles JA accepted the applicability of Bellgrove v Eldridge for that purpose, and said, at [64], that the developer “was entitled to rectification damages unless the rectification work was unnecessary and unreasonable”. Concerning one alleged defect, Giles JA said, at [69], that the referee: 
     
      
       
        
        “… declined to award damages simply because the rectification work had not been carried out. This was erroneous.” 
        
       
      
    82 Concerning another alleged defect, Giles JA said, at [71]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The mere fact that the doors were not going to be removed and replaced did not make their replacement unreasonable, although lack of complaint may have warranted a finding that it was not reasonable. An intention to pass on damages to shareholders did not mean unreasonableness.” 
        
       
      
    83 Concerning another alleged defect, Giles JA said, at [78]: 
     
      
       
        
        ‘That [the developer] would not spend the money on rectification did not make rectification work unreasonable in order to achieve the contractual objective, or displace damages in accordance with the  
        Bellgrove v Eldridge  
        principles.” 
        
       
      
    84 Consistently with these reasons, damages could have been awarded for work that was “theoretical” in the sense that it had not actually been carried out, and possibly would not be carried out, provided it was reasonable and necessary for such work to be carried out if the contractual object was to be achieved. 
     
      
       
      UI International 
       
      
    85 UI International concerned the striking out of a statement of claim for breach of contract concerning building works that the defendants had done for the plaintiff, in circumstances where (as Keane JA said at [104]): 
     
      
       
        
        “… the building is sold for a value unaffected by the defects and the rectification work cannot be done.” 
        
       
      
    86 The reason why the rectification work “cannot” be done, rather than was merely unlikely to be done, was that “it is not suggested that the new owners of the development require or permit the rectification work to be done” (ibid). The outcome in UI International was that the claim for damages was unsustainable. However, that situation is distinguishable from the present case not only because it is a case concerning breach of contract, not tort. More importantly, in UI International no rectification work in the loose sense had been done, while in the present case it has. 
     
      
       
      Tabcorp Holdings 
       
      
    87 The principles for assessment of damages for breach of contract contained in Bellgrove v Eldridge have recently been affirmed by the High Court in Tabcorp Holdings Ltd v Bowen Investments Pty Ltd [2009] HCA 8; (2009) 237 CLR 272. French CJ, Gummow, Heydon, Crennan and Kiefel JJ at 288 [17] referred to the example given in Bellgrove v Eldridge at 618 of the builder who used first quality bricks instead of the second-hand ones that the contract called for (para [39] above). They concluded from that example that: “… the test of ‘unreasonableness’ is only to be satisfied by fairly exceptional circumstances.” 
     
      
    88 All the cases I have listed in para [34] above are ones that talked about how the measure of damages could be affected if rectification work did not take place. However, they were talking about the rectification work “not taking place” in the sense that the person who had been wronged had not rectified the defects, and (in some of the cases) was unlikely to rectify the defects, in the sense that the property remained in its defective condition. That is not the situation in the present case. Once the flood had occurred, the Respondent had manifestly suffered damage in consequence of it. The condition of the premises was manifestly such that it was reasonable for the Respondent to make good the damage. Even though the Respondent did not make good the damage in the sense that it rebuilt the premises to exactly their pre-flood configuration, it still made good the damage in the sense that it did work that resulted in it having its premises no longer in a damaged condition. Here, it is only because the defects have been remedied (in the loose sense) that there is no occasion, now, to carry out further work because of the flood. But the rectification (in the loose sense) has cost the Respondent money. If the occurrence of the flood had been a breach of contract by the Appellant, the damages in accordance with Bellgrove v Eldridge would have been the amount of money it would have cost to restore the premises to their pre-flood condition, notwithstanding that the Respondent chose to do more extensive work than that. 
     
      
       
      The Measure of Damage for Tortious Damage to Property  
       
      
    89 Even though Bellgrove v Eldridge was not a case of tortious damage to property, there have been repeated examples of courts obtaining guidance from it in assessing damages for tortious damage to property.  
     
      
    90 In Murphy v Brown (1985) 1 NSWLR 131 at 133, Mahoney JA (with whom Hope JA agreed) said, concerning assessment of the measure of damages for negligent damage to a motor vehicle: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where a plaintiff claims the cost of work necessary to put him or his property in the pre-injury condition, the work must not merely be necessary for the purpose but ‘it must be a reasonable course to adopt’ to do that work:  
        Bellgrove v Eldridge 
         (1954) 90 CLR 613 at 618.” 
        
       
      
    91 In Central Coast Leagues Club, Giles CJ Comm D proceeded on the basis that there was no relevant difference between an action for breach of contract, and an action for negligence, so far as the applicability of Bellgrove v Eldridge was concerned. 
     
      
    92 In South Parklands Hockey & Tennis Centre Inc v Brown Falconer Group Pty Ltd [2004] SASC 81; (2004) 88 SASR 65 at 85 [89], Debelle J at [89] referred to the compensatory principle upon which damages for tort were to be assessed, and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “When assessing damages in a building case such as this, there is no relevant difference in principle between the law of contract and the law of tort.” 
        
       
      
    93 He went on to apply Bellgrove v Eldridge to the assessment of damages, in a case for negligent advice provided by architects and engineers concerning a structure that later proved defective. 
     
      
    94 In Kirkby v Coote [2006] QCA 61, Keane JA (with whom Williams JA agreed) at [47] and McMurdo J at [93] acted on a concession of the parties that, in an action for negligence in the design of a house, damages should be assessed in accordance with Bellgrove v Eldridge.  
     
      
    95 This repeated application of Bellgrove v Eldridge is not an overlooking of the differences between Bellgrove v Eldridge and the present case, to which Mr Parker has rightly pointed. Rather, it is a reflection of the very close similarity between the way that the principles operate for a court to assess damages for a breach of contract consisting of or resulting in building work that is not in accord with the contract, and for a court to assess damages for tortious damage to property. In both situations, it must be reasonable to take remedial action before the cost of that remedial action is allowable as damages. 
     
      
    96 If a chattel is damaged, and can be replaced with a reasonable substitute in the market for a price significantly less than the cost of repair, the measure of damages recoverable is the replacement cost, not the cost of repair: Darbishire v Warran [1963] 1 WLR 106; [1963] 3 All ER 310. Harman LJ, at 1071; 312 said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The principle is that of restitutio in integrum, that is to say, to put the plaintiff in the same position as though the damage had not happened. It has come to be settled that in general the measure of damage is the cost of repairing the damaged article; but there is an exception if it can be proved that the cost of repairs greatly exceeds the value in the market of the damaged article. This arises out of the plaintiff’s duty to minimise his damages.” 
        
       
      
    97 A particular application of the requirement that the restoration be reasonable is that damages in tort for damage to property, when measured by reference to cost of restoration, are subject to the mode of restoration being one that it is reasonable to adopt to make good the consequences of the tort. Thus, when a public road has been tortiously damaged, the roads authority is entitled to recover from the tortfeasor not the cost of restoring the road into precisely the same condition it was before the tort, but only (if it is less) the cost of making a road equally commodious as the old one: Lodge Holes Colliery Company Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1908] AC 323.  
     
      
    98 Minter v Eacott (1952) 69 WN (NSW) 93 was a decision of the Full Court of the NSW Supreme Court concerning an action for (relevantly) nuisance by withdrawal of lateral support for land. All judges in the Full Court were of the view that the trial judge had made a mistake by totally excluding the value of the plaintiff’s land from his consideration of the appropriate quantum of damage. KW Street CJ adopted a principle from the American Restatement (First) of Torts §929 (vol 4, p 660) that he paraphrased by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the plaintiff has an election to claim as compensation the difference between the value of the land before the harm and the value after the harm, or he may claim the cost of restoration which has been or may be reasonably incurred. I think that due emphasis has to be given to that word ‘reasonably’.” 
        
       
      
    99 He then quoted from pages 661-2 of the Restatement (§929, cmt b): 
     
      
       
        
        “Even in the absence of value arising from personal use, the reasonable cost of replacing the land in its original position is ordinarily allowable as the measure of recovery. Thus where a ditch is dug without right upon the land of another, the other normally is entitled to damages measured by the expense of filling the ditch, if he wishes it filled. If, however, the cost of replacing the land in its original condition is disproportionate to the diminution in the value of the land caused by the trespass, unless there is a reason personal to the owner for restoring the original condition, damages are measured only by the difference between the value of the land before and after the harm …”. 
        
       
      
    100 He limited that statement to one where damages were claimed for loss of lateral support of land, and said that the trial judge: 
     
      
       
        
        “… was in error in excluding the value of the land as one factor to which he should pay regard in determining whether the appropriate measure of damages in this case would be the difference between the value of the land before the lateral support had been removed and after it had been removed, or whether this was an appropriate case in which he should allow the cost of restoring the original situation and replacing the plaintiff in the same situation as that in which he would have been if the defendants had not dug away the lateral support to which the plaintiff was entitled.” 
        
       
      
    101 Owen J, at 96, also endorsed the passage from the Restatement, and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “… if that statement is correct the value of the land before and after the tortious act which caused the damage is relevant, because if the cost of restoration of the land to its former state is sought to be recovered it can only be recovered if that cost is not entirely disproportionate to the diminished value of the land.” 
        
       
      
    102 Clancy J, at 97, was to similar effect. 
     
      
    103 Evans v Balog [1976] 1 NSWLR 36 is a decision of this Court in an action for tortious damage to land. At 40, Samuels JA (with whom Moffitt P and Hutley JA agreed) said that “the true criterion of the selection between diminution of value and the cost of reinstatement” as the measure of damages was correctly stated by McGregor on Damages, 13th ed, at 713:  
     
      
       
        
        “The test which appears to be the appropriate one is the reasonableness of the plaintiffs’ desire to reinstate the property; this will be judged in part by the advantages to him of reinstatement in relation to the extra cost to the defendant in having to pay damages for reinstatement rather than damages calculated by the diminution in value of the land.” 
        
       
       
      In  
      Evans 
      , the land in question was the family home of the plaintiffs. That was a significant factor in establishing the reasonableness of reinstating it, even though the cost of restoration exceeded the diminution in value of the land that had arisen from the damage. While  
      Evans  
      did not in terms invoke  
      Bellgrove v Eldridge  
      concerning the measure of damage for tort (though it did concerning an alternative claim for breach of a contract to make good the damage), there is a close similarity in practical application between the test stated in  
      Evans 
      , and that stated in  
      Bellgrove v Eldridge 
      . 
       
      
    104 A similar result was arrived at in Hollebone v Midhurst and Fernhurst Builders Ltd [1968] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 38. There, a plaintiff whose family home was damaged by a negligently caused fire was held entitled to the cost of restoration, even though that cost exceeded the diminution in value of the land by virtue of the fire.  
     
      
    105 What counts as making good the damage, for the purpose of assessing damages for torts, needs to be understood bearing in mind what the purpose is for which one is asking what counts as “making good”. That purpose is ascertaining what the work is that is necessary to undo the consequences of the tort having been committed. The only interest of the defendant that bears upon the question of whether rectification work is reasonable is a financial one, sometimes expressed in the principle that a plaintiff must mitigate his damage. Thus, if, for instance, carpet of a particular shade of green has been damaged and objectively needs to be replaced if the damage is to be made good, it is immaterial that the plaintiff chooses as the replacement carpet one of a different colour. This is so even if carpet of the original shade of green had been available, provided only that the carpet actually chosen is not more expensive than the exact replacement would have been. If the plaintiff chooses a more expensive replacement when an exact replacement is available, the damages are limited to the cost of the exact replacement. As Pearson LJ said in Darbishire v Warran at WLR 1075; All ER 315, a plaintiff “is fully entitled to be as extravagant as he pleases, but not at the expense of the defendant.” 
     
      
    106 The cost of making good is merely one way of putting a dollar figure on the damage that the plaintiff has suffered, for the purpose of carrying through the compensatory principle. There are circumstances, of which the present is one, when the fact that money has not been spent on the precise items that would need to be acquired to restore property to its pre-damage condition does not prevent the cost of acquiring those items being the appropriate way of giving effect to the compensatory principle. Similarly, in circumstances where profits have been lost as a result of the shop being closed during the time it took to undertake the (loose sense) rectification that was carried out, and a lesser time would have involved in effecting a (precise sense) rectification, the appropriate quantum for loss of profits is the profits that would have been lost during the lesser of those times. 
     
      
    107 The circumstances of the Respondent in the present case differ markedly from the circumstances of a plaintiff who has completed a development project and sold it, still containing some defects, but for a price that has not been lessened by reason of those defects, to a purchaser who will never require the developer to remedy the defects. They differ markedly from the circumstance of a plaintiff whose property has been damaged but who has arrived at a fixed intention to leave the property in its damaged condition. It is unnecessary for me to say anything about the appropriate measure of damages in those very different situations. 
     
      
       
      Refurbishment Means No Damage Suffered? 
       
      
    108 Another submission of the Appellant is that the total demolition and replacement of the fitout was not an act of making good the damage, but rather was a separate and distinct action that “rendered redundant any true repair works”. 
     
      
    109 It is correct that, if voluntary action on the part of a plaintiff has the effect that the plaintiff no longer suffers damage in consequence of the tort, damages are not claimable concerning events occurring thereafter. A common example is when a plaintiff who has suffered bodily injury submits to medical treatment that is totally successful. However, in that situation the plaintiff can still recover damages to the extent that they have been caused by the tort in the period up to the effecting of the successful cure, including the costs of obtaining that cure.  
     
      
    110 In the present case, the effecting of the total refit of the premises had the effect that the Respondent no longer suffered any damage in consequence of the flooding, but the refit cost the Respondent money. To the extent that, by effecting the refit, the Respondent obtained more than a rectification of the damage caused by the flood, the compensatory principle requires that it must itself bear the cost of obtaining that extra. While having a total refit has not been shown to be of any particular monetary benefit to the Respondent, it was the Respondent’s choice (found to be a reasonable one in the circumstances) to take the shop from being in a damaged condition by effecting the total refit. However, the judge has rejected the submission that Mr Canturi had a pre-existing intention to carry out a total refit. The judge found (at [161]) that: 
     
      
       
        
        “While he was considering refitting an already high standard jewellery store fit out, the damage indeed precipitated that business decision because it meant that the store would have to be closed for a period of time in relation to repairs. It was because Mr Canturi decided to close the store only once that he decided to include in his major refit repairs to the water damage.” 
        
       
      
    111 That is a finding, in which I see no error, that the water damage was one of the causes of the refit. To the extent to which there were contributing causes besides the water damage, it was the judge’s task to assess the compensation that would make good those consequences properly attributable to the flooding. This she did by allowing the amount that a precise rectification of the water damage alone would have cost, and leaving the Respondent to bear any amount it had spent in excess of that. 
     
      
    112 That the judge was justified in proceeding in this way is, in my view, illustrated by the decision in Admiralty Commissioners v SS Chekiang. That case arose when the respondents’ ship negligently collided with HMS Cairo and damaged her. At the time of the collision the Cairo was shortly due for her annual refit. The Admiralty decided to repair the collision damage and carry out the refit at the same time, even though the refitment was not due at the time. The combined repairs took about 8 weeks, while 20 days would have sufficed to repair the collision damage alone. Viscount Dunedin, at 642, stated the principle on which damage were awarded: 
     
      
       
        
        “… inasmuch as it is found in fact, that there was no necessity to make the refit, the Admiralty were entitled to take advantage of the vessel being in dry dock without being called on to contribute to the expense of docking or to forgo the payments in full to which they were entitled as for the loss of the use of the vessel for the period of detention due to the collision during which the vessel was rendered unfit for her active service. This period … was fixed at 20 days.” 
        
       
      
    113 Lord Phillimore said, at 652: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is a case where, the going into dock for repairs being necessary, the authorities on the whole thought it convenient to advance the period of refit (though that advance is itself open to some objection) and combined the two operations, or it may be said superadded the refit on the repair. 
        
       
       
        
        This being so, there being no question that the detention for twenty days was due to the collision, and all that can be said on behalf of the owners of the  
        Chekiang 
         is that the Admiralty employed the time profitably and thereby saved a part of the period which would at some later date, if no accident had happened and nothing special had supervened, been taken up for a refit.  
        
       
       
        
        My Lords, it seems to me, as indeed to all your Lordships, that a wrongdoer cannot claim to have the damages given against him reduced by any such consideration.” 
        
       
       
      Failing to Bring Benefits to Account? 
       
      
    114 Another criticism the Appellant has is that the judge erred in that she “failed to bring to account the additional benefits obtained by the provision of the entirely new fitout.”  
     
      
    115 There have been cases where a primary legal decision-maker has been held to have been mistaken in failing to deduct, from the costs incurred in seeking to make good the consequences of some particular wrong, the value of incidental benefits that the plaintiff has received. British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co Ltd v Underground Electric Railways Co Ltd [1912] AC 673 was such a case. Westinghouse had supplied the Railways Company with turbines that failed to perform to the contractually required standard. Eventually, the Railways Company replaced the turbines with machines of a different design and manufacture, called Parsons machines, that had a greater capacity and a smaller steam consumption than had been called for by the contractual standard applicable to the Westinghouse turbines. An arbitrator found that the Parsons machines were so superior that, even if Westinghouse had delivered turbines that had complied in all respects with the contract, it would have been in the financial interest of the Railways Company to replace the Westinghouse turbines with Parsons machines (at 676). He found that the purchase of the Parsons machines was a reasonable and prudent course to mitigate or prevent the damage arising from the breach of contract (at 684). It would have been possible for the Railways Company to purchase turbines that had the same capacity as that for which Westinghouse had contracted, but it chose to purchase the larger capacity replacement model.  
     
      
    116 The contention of Westinghouse before the arbitrator was that, having regard to the facts he should  
     
      
       
        
        “… draw the inference that the ‘commercial life’ of the [Westinghouse] machines had expired at the date of the purchase by the [Railway Company] of the Parsons machines, and that the said facts were therefore relevant to the question of the amount of damages recoverable [by the Railway Company] and that accordingly no further damages of any kind were recoverable … after the date when Parsons machines were procurable by the [Railway Company]; and further that the cost of procuring and installing Parsons machines was not recoverable by the [Railway Company] from [Westinghouse].” (676) 
        
       
      
    117 Viscount Haldane LC (with whom Lords Ashbourne, Macnaghten and Atkinson agreed) held, at 692, that the contention of Westinghouse on that question was correct “so far, but only so far, as they contended that the several facts relied upon by them were relevant matter to be considered by the arbitrator in assessing the damages”. The case was remitted for further hearing, without their Lordships identifying the precise way in which that matter should be “considered” by the arbitrator. 
     
      
    118 A qualification on this principle is that it is not necessary to bring to account, in assessing damages, the extent to which benefits are derived from making good the damage, if the only practicable way of making good the damage involves conferring those benefits. In Harbutt’s “Plasticine” Ltd v Wayne Tank and Pump Co Ltd [1970] 1 QB 447, the plaintiff’s factory was destroyed as a consequence of a breach of contract by the defendant. Reinstatement of the old factory was not legally permissible, so a new factory was built. The Court of Appeal rejected an argument that the measure of damages should be the difference in value of the land before and after the fire. Lord Denning MR said, at 468:  
     
      
       
        
        “The destruction of a building is different from the destruction of a chattel. If a second-hand car is destroyed, the owner only gets its value; because he can go into the market and get another second-hand car to replace it. He cannot charge the other party with the cost of replacing it with a new car. But when this mill was destroyed, the plasticine company had no choice. They were bound to replace it as soon as they could, not only to keep their business going, but also to mitigate the loss of profit (for which they would be able to charge the defendants). They replaced it in the only possible way, without adding any extras. I think they should be allowed the cost of replacement. True it is that they got new for old; but I do not think the wrongdoer can diminish the claim on that account. If they had added extra accommodation or made extra improvements, they would have to give credit. But that is not this case. I think the judge was right on this point.” 
        
       
      
    119 Widgery LJ reached the same conclusion, saying at 473: 
     
      
       
        
        “Nor do I accept that the plaintiffs must give credit under the heading of ‘betterment’ for the fact that their new factory is modern in design and materials. To do so would be the equivalent of forcing the plaintiffs to invest their money in the modernising of their plant which might be highly inconvenient for them.” 
        
       
      
    120 Similarly, Cross LJ at 476 said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Further, I do not think that the defendants are entitled to claim any deduction from the actual cost of rebuilding and re-equipping simply on the ground that the plaintiffs have got new for old. It is not in practice possible to rebuild and re-equip a factory with old and worn materials and plant corresponding to what was there before, and such benefit as the plaintiffs may get by having a new building and new plant in place of an old building and old plant is something in respect of which the defendants are not, as I see it, entitled to any allowance. I can well understand that if the plaintiffs in rebuilding the factory with a different and more convenient lay-out had spent more money than they would have spent had they rebuilt it according to the old plan, the defendants would have been entitled to claim that the excess should be deducted in calculating the damages. But the defendants did not call any evidence to make out a case of betterment on these lines and we were told that in fact the planning authorities would not have allowed the factory to be rebuilt on the old lines.” 
        
       
      
    121 Even in circumstances where there is no practicable way of making good damage than by replacing damaged property with something superior to the damaged item, it can in some circumstances be appropriate to take the superiority of the replacement item into account in assessing the quantum of the damages. Hoad v Scone Motors Pty Ltd [1977] 1 NSWLR 88 arose when the plaintiffs’ tractor and mower, used by them in their farming business, was destroyed by a fire caused by the defendants’ negligence. They purchased new replacement equipment, an action held to be a reasonable mitigation of their loss. This was because no second-hand replacement equipment was available locally, and there was a practical need for the plaintiffs to be able to obtain service for the equipment from its vendor. However, the majority (Moffitt P and Hutley JA) held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to damages equal to the purchase cost of the replacement equipment. Consistently with British Westinghouse, the plaintiffs were required to bring to account any benefits that accrued to them in consequence of their mitigation. At the time of the fire the plaintiffs were intending to give up their property in 18 months time, and if the fire had not occurred would not have replaced their existing tractor. The new tractor, when sold at the time the farm was given up, was likely to bring more money than the old tractor would have brought, and the court held that that difference was one that the plaintiffs were required to bring to account in assessment of damages.  
     
      
    122 While Moffitt P and Hutley JA both did not follow the decision in Wayne Tank, they had different reasons for doing so. Moffitt P distinguished it, on a basis he described at 94: 
     
      
       
        
        “To replace the destroyed building [in  
        Wayne Tank 
        ], capital had to be laid out to erect a like building in the only way it could be, namely with new materials. The plaintiffs were not in the business of buying and selling factories. They needed the replacement factory for indefinite use. There was no question of it being sold. Prior to its destruction there was no contemplation of reconstructing it in the foreseeable future. The facts in the present case are quite different. Farm equipment deteriorates rapidly, and it is either written off or is replaced at short intervals. Planned replacement at short intervals was in fact the business practice of the plaintiffs. If this practice would have continued, then the consequence of the fire was merely to accelerate the inevitable capital expense of acquiring a new tractor and mower. If, as the plaintiffs claimed, but for the fire they would not have purchased another tractor or mower, because they were giving up the farm in eighteen months, presumably meaning they would not then need such equipment, then the total consequence of the fire, ie their total acts of mitigation to avoid crop losses over the eighteen months of farming, would be that capital expense was incurred, which would not otherwise have been incurred, in purchasing the new equipment and that, on resale after eighteen months, substantially less than the capital outlaid would be recovered. The loss of resale value of new equipment in that time would be greater than of old equipment. The entire practice, intention and ensuing events are connected with the loss, or with the connected acts of mitigation and are not res inter alios acta. Damages for the loss must have regard to all of such facts and hence bring to account any gain so connected with the acts of mitigation.” 
        
       
      
    123 The reason of Hutley JA at 97 for declining to follow Wayne Tank was that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it cannot stand with the judgment of the House of Lords in  
        British Westinghouse  
        … a case which does not seem to have been referred to in argument in the former case.” 
        
       
      
    124 He was of the view that this Court should follow a decision of the House of Lords when there was no contrary decision of the High Court or the Privy Council. In Hyder Consulting at [47], Sheller JA disagreed with Hutley JA’s view that Wayne Tank was inconsistent with British Westinghouse. Sheller JA said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The facts were different. The factory owner had no choice but to build the replacement factory which it did. On the other had the railway company chose, albeit for good commercial reasons, not merely to replace the turbines but to purchase a superior version.” 
        
       
      
    125 I agree with Sheller JA in this respect. 
     
      
    126 Diamond v Lovell [2002] 1 AC 384 also concerned requiring a plaintiff to bring to account benefits it had received beyond mere compensation. It arose from an English commercial institution whereby there were specialist vehicle hire companies that made motor cars available to persons whose vehicles had been damaged through the negligence of another driver. The hire company would charge a rate of hire, and would also provide the hirer with credit for the hire charges, and would conduct any debt recovery, including litigation, that might be necessary to recover the hire charges from the negligent person. The rates of hire charged by such companies were greater than the rates of hire charged by ordinary car hire companies. The litigation in the House of Lords concerned the recoverability, from the negligent driver, of such hire charges. While the ratio of the case was that the charges were not recoverable because the hire contract was a particular type of regulated consumer credit transaction, and the statutory requirements governing such a contract had not been complied with, Lord Hoffmann considered what the situation would be if the statutory requirements had been complied with. He upheld the finding of the trial judge and the majority in the Court of Appeal that it was reasonable for a motorist in the plaintiff’s position to use the service offered by the specialist hire company, but denied that the full rate of hire was recoverable as damages. At 401-2, he pointed out that under the contract the plaintiff received not only car hire, but additional benefits in the form of credit, being saved the trouble of pursuing the recovery claim, being saved the obligation to pay the difference between recoverable costs and actual costs of a successful claim, and not having to bear the risk of paying the costs of an unsuccessful claim. To the extent that the package of benefits with which she was provided under the contract included more than hire, it was necessary to quantify the value of the non-hire benefits. At 402-3, his Lordship expressed the view that, while it will depend upon the facts of each particular case, it would ordinarily be the difference between the rates of hire charged by the specialist car hire company, and the rates of hire charged by an ordinary car hire company. 
     
      
    127 The principles in those cases do not find application in the facts of the present case. There is nothing analogous, in the present case, to the benefit over and above compliance with the standard of performance that had been contractually required from the Westinghouse turbines that the Railway Company in British Westinghouse obtained by purchasing the Parsons machines. Nor is there any benefit, in the present case, analogous to the extra sale price that the plaintiffs in Hoad would be likely to obtain by having a newer tractor to sell when they carried through the intention that they already had, at the time of the tort, of giving up their farm. There is nothing analogous, in the present case, to the benefit beyond being provided with a replacement vehicle that the plaintiff in Diamond v Lovell acquired from the terms of her contract with the vehicle hire company. No attempt was made in the present case to prove that the shop, with its totally new fitout, was more profitable or in any other way more valuable than it would have been if the damage had never occurred. The judge specifically rejected the submission that, before the damage, the plaintiff’s fitout was nearing the end of its working life. While there was some evidence from Mr Canturi that he was sceptical about it being possible for the store to be restored to exactly its pre-flood condition without it being obvious that there had been a patch job, the Respondent did not put its case on a basis that Mr Canturi’s scepticism was well-founded and reasonable and thus that a total refit was called for. Nor did the judge find that Mr Canturi’s scepticism was well founded or reasonable. Rather, the judge’s finding is in substance that there were several contributing causes to the eventual total refit – the need to rectify the flooding damage, Mr Canturi’s recognition of desirability of a total refit, and the need to close the shop for building works only once and during a less busy period of the year. Of course, to the extent that the installation of the new fitout was more than the Respondent needed to do to make good the damage caused by the flooding, it cannot recover the full cost of the fitout, but it has not claimed the full cost of the fitout, and the judge has endeavoured to find the means of measuring the extent to which the Respondent has suffered damage caused only by the flooding. 
     
      
       
      No Evidence of Water Damage Increasing Cost of New Fitout? 
       
      
    128 The Appellant submits that there is no evidence of what it says is an important matter, namely evidence that work of installing the new fitout cost more, took longer, or was made more complex than it otherwise would have been because of the water damage. The implicit submission is that it is only to the extent that the water damage increased the cost of carrying out the new fitout, beyond what it would have cost had the water damage never occurred, that damages are recoverable. 
     
      
    129 If, before the tort occurred, the Respondent had already embarked on and was likely to carry through a plan for the installation of new fitout of the type it eventually installed, the proper measure of damages may well have been the increased cost of carrying out the new fitout by reason of the water damage, beyond what it might have cost had the water damage never occurred. Such a measure of damages would be consistent with Hole & Son (Sayers Common) Ltd v Harrisons of Thurncoe Ltd [1973] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 345 and CR Taylor (Wholesale) Ltd v Hepworths Ltd. In Hole & Son, cottages owned by the plaintiff were seriously damaged when the defendant’s motor vehicle ran into them. However, before the accident occurred, the plaintiff intended to demolish the cottages and rebuild as and when the opportunity presented itself. The damages were thus not the cost of reinstatement, but some comparatively small items of temporary repair actually carried out, and actual loss of rent. 
     
      
    130 In CR Taylor (Wholesale), the plaintiff’s building was gutted by a fire caused through the defendant’s negligence. At the time of the fire the building was disused, and had been disused for several years, with the plaintiff: 
     
      
       
        
        “… merely holding on to the premise in only one particular sense as an investment, that is to say an investment which might over the years show capital appreciation by way of increase in development value. That development value lay in the site itself, not in the buildings whole or destroyed which had previously been erected upon it.” (WLR 669-70; All ER 794) 
        
       
       
      While the fire had caused the premises to diminish in value by £2,500, that amount was less than the amount that demolition of the premises for redevelopment would have cost, and thus no damages were allowed for either reinstatement or loss in land value.  
       
      
    131 However, the principle involved in those cases is not applicable in the present case, because the judge has found that the water damage was one of the contributing causes to the whole of the new refit being put in place. 
     
      
    132 For these reasons I would not uphold any of grounds (b)-(e). 
     
      
       
       PART B – GST 
       
       
      No GST Because Payment is “Theoretical”? 
       
      
    133 The Appellant challenged the inclusion of an amount for GST in the material damage component of the damages award. One basis for that challenge was that the Respondent had never spent the sums of money concerning which material damages were allowed, and in relation to which GST was also allowed, and thus the claim for GST was “theoretical” in the same way as the claim for damages equal to the cost of restoration of the premises to their pre-flood condition was “theoretical”. For the same reasons as I have already given, I would not uphold that particular challenge. 
     
      
       
      No GST Because No Net Loss Re GST? 
       
      
    134 The Appellant has a separate argument concerning why GST should not have been included in the damages. It starts from the common ground that the Respondent is and at all relevant times has been a trading corporation that is registered for GST purposes. Mr Parker submits that even if (as one would ordinarily expect to be the case) the Respondent paid amounts including GST to suppliers of goods or services, involved in restoration of the premises, the Respondent would not be permanently out of pocket for that amount of GST. Thus, he submits, it is contrary to the compensatory principle, and thus wrong, to include the GST in the amount of damages, when the damages are an amount that the Respondent can permanently keep. He submits that even if the Respondent had a cash outflow of the amount of GST paid, that cash outflow does not give rise to any net loss, because it is balanced out by an input credit of an equal amount to which the Respondent becomes entitled. 
     
      
    135 The reasoning for that conclusion is as follows. GST is imposed under the legislation called A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth) (“the GST Act”). Under section 7-1(1) GST Act, GST is payable on “taxable supplies”. Under section 7-1(2), an entitlement to an input tax credit arises on “creditable acquisitions”. Under section 7-5, 
     
      
       
        
        “Amounts of GST and amounts of input tax credits are set off against each other to produce a net amount for a tax period (which may be altered to take account of adjustments).” 
        
       
      
    136 Section 7-15 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The net amount for a tax period is the amount that the entity must pay to the Commonwealth, or the Commonwealth must refund to the entity, in respect of the period.” 
        
       
      
    137 In accordance with subdivision 9-A of the GST Act, the Respondent would make a taxable supply whenever it sold an item in the course of its business in Australia. Pursuant to section 9-40, it is the Respondent that is obliged to pay the GST that is payable on any taxable supply that it makes. 
     
      
    138 Section 17-5 GST Act says: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The  
        net amount  
        for a tax period applying to you is worked out using the following formula: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          GST – Input tax credits 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          where: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          GST 
           is the sum of all of the GST for which you are liable on the taxable supplies that are attributable to the tax period. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          input tax credits  
          is the sum of all of the input tax credits to which you are entitled for the creditable acquisitions and creditable importations that are attributable to the tax period.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    139 Pursuant to section 17-5(2), the “net amount” can be altered by any “adjustments”. Neither party submitted that the outcome of the present case was affected by the provisions of the GST Act concerning adjustments. 
     
      
    140 The meaning of “creditable acquisition” emerges from section 11-5 GST Act: 
     
      
       
        
        “You make a  
        creditable acquisition 
         if: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) you acquire anything solely or partly for a creditable purpose; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the supply of the thing to you is a taxable supply; and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) you provide, or are liable to provide, consideration for the supply; and 
        
       
       
        
        (d) you are registered, or required to be registered.” 
        
       
      
    141 While there are some exceptions not presently relevant, the meaning of “creditable purpose” is adequately conveyed by section 11-15(1) GST Act: 
     
      
       
        
        “You acquire a thing for a  
        creditable purpose 
         to the extent that you acquire it in carrying on your enterprise.” 
        
       
      
    142 We have seen that the Respondent is liable to pay GST concerning all the taxable supplies that it makes in the course of its business. Those “taxable supplies” would be wholly, or predominantly, its sales of merchandise to customers. If the Respondent were to acquire goods or services for the purpose of improving the appearance or usability of its shop, that would be a “creditable purpose” so far as it was concerned. Thus, acquiring those goods or services would be a “creditable acquisition”, that would entitle it to an input tax credit concerning the amount of GST it paid in making that creditable acquisition. In this way, the payment of the GST component of the cost of goods or services for the purpose of making good the damage to the shop would reduce the “net amount” by the amount of that GST component.  
     
      
    143 Section 33-3 GST Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “If: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the net amount for a tax period applying to you is greater than zero; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the tax period is a quarterly tax period; 
        
       
       
        
        you must pay the net amount to the Commissioner …” 
        
       
      
    144 Under section 35-5 GST Act: 
     
      
       
        
        “If the net amount for a tax period is less than zero, the Commissioner must, on behalf of the Commonwealth, pay that amount (expressed as a positive amount) to you.” 
        
       
      
    145 Thus, obtaining an input credit for the GST paid on a creditable acquisition results in the taxpayer effectively receiving back the amount of that input credit, in the form of either a reduction in the amount of GST that it must pay, or in the form of a refund.  
     
      
    146 Though it might not take account of all the nuances of the operation of the provisions to which I have referred, in broad terms their effect is as described in the Australian Master Tax Guide, 44th ed, (2009) at ¶34-010, p 1,617: 
     
      
       
        
        “… registered business entities receive an amount representing GST but do not keep it, and pay GST but get a credit for it. This means that they act essentially as collecting agents for the tax. The ultimate burden of the tax falls on the private consumer of the goods and services, as this person gets no credit for the GST they pay.” 
        
       
       
      A fuller account is in the judgment of Sackville J (as his Honour then was) in  
      D B Rreefs Funds Management Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  
      [2005] FCA 509; (2005) 218 ALR 144 at [22]-[27]; (aff  
      Commissioner of Taxation v D B Rreef Funds Management Ltd  
      [2006] FCAFC 89; (2006) 152 FCR 437). 
       
      
    147 I accept that the consequence of these provisions is that, even though the Respondent might pay out an amount of GST in connection with the goods and services which it acquired for the purpose of making good the damage to its premises, it would be able to recover that amount back, either in the form of a reduction of the net amount it must remit to the Commissioner for the quarter in which the payment was made, or as a refund. Thus the amount of GST component of any payments it made for making good the premises would not ultimately be a loss that it suffered. Given the compensatory purpose of the damages award, it was wrong to include that component in the award of damages. 
     
      
    148 Having reached that conclusion as a matter of principle, I turn to see to what extent the conclusion is consistent with previous decisions. I proceed in this way because all the previous decisions, apart from one of the Queensland Court of Appeal that is not directly in point, are first-instance decisions. 
     
      
    149 Some awards of damages for a tort have included GST on the individual items that go to make up the quantum: eg, my judgment in Bennett v Goodwin [2005] NSWSC 930; (2005) 62 ATR 515 at [16]-[17] (which related to conversion of goods); Nemeth v Prynew Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 511 at [3]-[6] per Macready AsJ (which related to nuisance through removal of lateral support to land – Piling Contractors (Qld) Pty Ltd v Prynew Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 118). Similarly, in Martin v London County Council [1947] KB 628, where damages were awarded against a bailee for having failed to exercise care concerning the bailed items, the quantum of damages was assessed as the cost of replacement articles including (English) purchase tax. Other decisions have included GST in the amount properly payable under an indemnity for legal costs: my judgment in Vrkic v Otta International [2003] NSWSC 641 at [25]-[26]; Thornton v Apollo Nominees Pty Ltd [2005] TASSC 38; (2005) 15 Tas R 35 per Evans J. In Tenderwatch Pty Ltd v Reed Business Information Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 931; (2008) 78 IPR 329 at [21], Heerey J, in quantifying the profits for which a copyright infringer was being required to account, deducted GST that the infringer had paid in the course of his infringing activities because it “reduced the actual profit or benefit derived by [the infringer] from the infringement.”  
     
      
    150 It is important that, in each of the Australian cases just mentioned neither the recipient of the damages, the person with the benefit of the costs order, nor the copyright infringer was shown to be registered for GST purposes, and thus entitled to the benefit of an input credit on any GST paid. Because the tort plaintiffs were not entitled to an input credit on any GST paid, they would suffer a net loss that included the amount of GST paid. Similarly, in Martin v London County Council, the owner of the articles was an ordinary person, not shown to be engaged in any business activity. Similarly, the people entitled to the indemnity for costs would be out of pocket by the amount, including GST, that they owed their lawyers, because they could not receive an input credit concerning those legal fees. Similarly, the infringer had actually parted with an amount that included GST, and would not receive an input credit concerning that amount. Thus, those cases do not affect the reasoning above about the situation of the Respondent. I also note that there are no complications in the present case of the type that might arise if a plaintiff had not been registered for GST purposes for the whole of the time that was relevant to the assessment of damages. These matters point up, however, the importance of consideration being given to how the compensation principle applies to an individual plaintiff, when deciding whether an award of damages should include the GST that is payable on the individual items that go to make up the award of damages.  
     
      
    151 In summary, as the GST legislation currently stands, if the plaintiff in an action for tort is registered for GST purposes, and stands to receive an input credit for any GST payments incurred in making good its damage, and there is no impediment to the plaintiff receiving the full benefit of the input credit, that GST amount should be excluded from the quantum of damages recoverable. 
     
      
    152 There have been cases consistent with the analysis that I have given that concern the extent to which an entity registered for GST purposes is entitled to recover the GST component of legal costs and disbursements pursuant to an order for costs in its favour. In courts where party-party legal costs are payable in accordance with a court scale, and an order for party-party costs has been made: 
     
      
       
       the total amount of professional costs assessed in accordance with the scale can be recovered:  
      Merringtons Pty Ltd v Luxottica Retail Australia Pty Ltd  
      (VSC, Wood M, 16 June 2006, unreported) at [34];  
      Keen v Telstra Corporation Ltd  
      [2006] FCA 834; (2006) 153 FCR 28 at 36-7 [46] per Rares J;  
      Hennessey Glass and Aluminium Pty Ltd v Watpac Australia Pty Ltd  
      [2007] QDC 57; (2007) 69 ATR 374 at [138]-[139];  
      ChongHerr Investments Ltd v Titan Sandstone Pty Ltd  
      [2007] QCA 278 at [9] per de Jersey CJ, Keane JA and Philippides J. This is subject to a qualification that the costs actually paid by the party entitled to the costs order exceed the scale amount plus what the GST would be on that scale amount. If the costs actually paid do not exceed the scale amount plus what the GST would be on that scale amount, the principle of indemnity requires that the party with the benefit of the costs order should receive no more than the amount it has actually paid:  
      Hennessey  
      at [139]-[140],  
      ChongHerr  
      at [9]. That seems consistent with the position in England and South Africa, as discussed in  
      Merringtons  
      at [22]-[26].  
       
       
       If a disbursement has been paid in an amount inclusive of GST, the amount recoverable is the amount paid minus the GST component, because the entity with the benefit of the costs order has been entitled to the benefit of an input credit for that amount of GST:  
      Merringtons  
      at [35]-[36], [41],  
      Hennessey  
      at [142]-[143],  
      ChongHerr 
       at [9]. It is this situation that is most closely analogous to the present case. 
       
       
       If a disbursement has been paid for an item that does not attract GST (such as court filing fees) the whole of that amount of disbursement is recoverable, because no question arises of any input credit having been received concerning that disbursement:  
      Hennessey  
      at [132], [143]. 
       
      
    153 Even in courts where party-party legal costs are payable pursuant to a court scale, if an order has been made for indemnity costs in favour of an entity registered for GST: 
     
      
       
       the amount of professional costs recoverable is the amount actually paid, minus the GST:  
      Beach Retreat Pty Ltd v Mooloolaba Yacht Marina Ltd  
      [2009] QSC 84 at [113]-[115]. 
       
       
       Disbursements are recoverable in accordance with the same principle as applies concerning recovery of disbursements pursuant to an order for party-party costs:  
      Beach Retreat  
      at [113]-[115]. 
       
      
    154 The results of these cases concerning the GST consequences of a costs order in favour of an entity registered for GST accord with the conclusion I have come to in the present case. They also are consistent with the instructions to the staff of the Australian Taxation Office contained in a Practice Statement Law Administration of the Australian Taxation Office PS LA 2008/16. 
     
      
    155 For these reasons, I conclude that the trial judge was in error in including the GST component in the damages awarded. 
     
      
       
      Damages Award Itself Subject to GST? 
       
      
    156 Mr Brender, counsel for the Respondent, put forward in oral argument an alternative basis for allowing GST. It was that the damages award itself would be subject to GST. I do not accept that argument. 
     
      
    157 An essential prerequisite for there being an obligation to pay GST concerning (relevantly for present purposes) a supply of goods or services is that there is a “taxable supply”. Under section 9-5 GST Act, an essential prerequisite of there being a “taxable supply” is that “you make the supply for consideration”. The Australian Taxation Office has issued a public ruling, GSTR 2001/4, concerning the GST consequences of court orders and out-of-court settlements. It states, at para [60], that “a court, in giving judgment, does not make a supply for GST purposes”. Nor is there any relevant “taxable supply” involved in the events that led to litigation such as the present. At [71]-[73] the ruling considers situations, including “claims for damages arising out of property damage” and concludes: 
     
      
       
        
        “This damage, loss or injury, being the substance of the dispute, cannot in itself be characterised as a supply made by the aggrieved party. This is because the damage, loss or injury, in itself does not constitute a supply under section 9-10 of the  
        GST Act 
        .” 
        
       
      
    158 Nor would a judgment in the present case later, of itself, generate a liability for GST. The ruling says, at [61]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The payment, in money, of a judgment debt will not itself be a supply for GST purposes. It is excluded from being a supply under subsection 9-10(4).” 
        
       
      
    159 When this public ruling has been issued, it decides for practical purposes the way in which the GST legislation will be administered. It would be pointless for me to examine in any more detail the correctness of the Commissioner’s views expressed in that ruling. 
     
      
       
       PART C – ORDERS  
       
       
      Costs 
       
      
    160 Both parties asked us not to deal with costs in the course of the judgment, but to allow them to make submissions on that question in light of the Court’s eventual decision on the questions of principle involved in the case.  
     
      
    161 It is preferable for this Court to hear argument on all questions involved in a case, including costs, at the one hearing if it is practicable to do so. Proceeding in this way advances the Court’s obligation to seek to resolve litigation in a way that is just, quick and cheap (section 56(1) Civil Procedure Act 2005). Only for good reason should the Court proceed in any different way.  
     
      
    162 We have been informed that the appropriate costs order might be affected by the terms of an offer or offers that one or other of the parties has made to the other. (Of course, we were not informed which party had made an offer, or anything about its terms.) In that circumstance it is appropriate to defer the question of costs for later argument. At present I would expect that there will be no dispute about the evidentiary basis on which any such argument occurs, and I see no reason why that argument should not take place by written submissions without oral argument. 
     
      
    163 My decision concerning GST, and the need to calculate interest on the reduced judgment sum to a date that approximates the date when final orders will be made, provide a further reason why it is not practicable to make orders now that finally dispose of the appeal. I envisage that if interest is calculated to a date that approximates when the final orders will be made, that date can be nominated as the effective date of the judgment, from which post-judgment interest will then run in accordance with the rules. Proceeding in that way means that any discrepancy between the date nominated as the effective date, and the date when the final orders are actually made, prejudices neither party. The parties should endeavour to agree upon short minutes of the orders needed to give effect to these reasons for judgment, apart from the costs orders. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    164 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      (2) Set aside the judgment in the court below. 
       
       
      (3) Direct the parties, within 14 days (excluding legal vacation) of the date of delivery of these reasons for judgment: 
       
       
        
        (a) to provide to each judge hearing this appeal agreed short minutes of the orders necessary to give effect to these reasons for judgment, other than the order for costs; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) in the event that agreement is not possible, to provide to each judge hearing this appeal their respective written submissions about the orders that should be made to give effect to these reasons for judgment, other than concerning costs; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) to file any evidence on which either seeks to rely bearing on the question of costs. 
        
       
       
      (4) Direct the Appellant to provide to each judge, and to the Respondent, within 14 days (excluding legal vacation) of the date of delivery of these reasons for judgment, its written submissions about the costs orders that should be made. 
       
       
      (5) Direct the Respondent, within 24 days (excluding legal vacation) of the date of delivery of these reasons for judgment, to provide to each judge and to the Appellant, its written submissions about costs. 
       
       
      (6) Reserve further consideration of the orders appropriate to give effect to these reasons for judgment, and costs. 
       
      
    165 MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Campbell JA. 
     
      
    166 SACKVILLE AJA: I agree with Campbell JA’s conclusion that the appellant has not made out any of grounds of appeal (b) to (e). 
     
      
    167 In my opinion, the unchallenged findings of the primary Judge ([18]-[26], above) require the conclusion that her Honour did not err in her approach to the assessment of damages. Putting to one side that the respondent actually carried out certain remedial works ([33], above), it was in accordance with compensatory principle ([30]-[31]) to award damages by reference to the costs that the respondent would have incurred if, instead of carrying out the complete internal refurbishment, it had reinstated the premises to their original condition. It is to be remembered that the primary Judge found that the refurbishment had been brought forward by reason of the flood (the tortious act) and that the respondent had acted reasonably in undertaking the refurbishment, thereby subsuming the works required to reinstate the premises. In these circumstances, it seems to me in accordance with established principle, as Campbell JA explains, to assess damages by reference to the reasonable cost of rectification. 
     
      
    168 I agree with Campbell JA’s reasoning and conclusions on the inclusion of an amount for GST in the damages award. 
     
      
    169 I agree with the orders proposed by Campbell JA.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The State of New South Wales (the State), by further amended summons filed on 14 December 2009, applies for a continuing detention order in respect of the defendant pursuant to s 14A of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (“the Act”). The matter was initiated by the filing of the first summons on 6 October 2009. I have earlier made an interim detention order: State of New South Wales v Thomas (Interim) [2009] NSWSC 1119 (“the interim judgment”).2 Mr Thomas is a sex offender within the meaning of s 4 of the Act as he has in the past been sentenced to imprisonment following conviction for a “serious sex offence” as defined in s 5(1)(a), being aggravated sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900. 3 The application is brought under s 14A which permits the State to apply for a continuing detention order against a person who is found guilty of an offence under s 12, being an offence of failing to comply with an interim or extended supervision order. The offender was made the subject of an extended supervision order in proceedings determined by Adams J last year: State of New South Wales v Thomas [2008] NSWSC 1340. The order was made on 8 October 2008 and was for a period of 12 months. On 17 July 2009 at the Waverley Local Court the defendant was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months, with a non-parole period of 9 months, in respect of 3 offences of failing to comply with that order. The sentences were each specified to have commenced on 22 January 2009. The defendant’s parole expired on 21 October 2009. He has remained in custody since that time pursuant to the interim detention order that I made on 20 October 2009 and which I renewed on 16 November 2009 and further renewed at the conclusion of the hearing before me on 14 December 2009.Issues for determination4 The Court may determine an application under Part 3 of the Act, which this application is, by making an extended supervision order or a continuing detention order, or by dismissing the application: s 17(1).5 An extended supervision order may only be made if the Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the defendant is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision: s 17(2). It may make a continuing detention order only if it is satisfied of that matter and further, that there is a high degree of probability that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order: s 17(3). In determining whether to make either of those orders the Court must have regard to the matters listed in s 17(4) in addition to any other matter it considers relevant. In this case there is the additional requirement that the Court have regard to the nature of the failure to comply with the requirements of the extended supervision order made by Adams J and the likelihood of further failures to comply: s 17(4A). 6 As I mentioned in the interim judgment (at [10]), the “high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence” requirement is not without difficulty. Authority which I must follow has held that “likely in s 17(2) and (3) denotes a degree of probability at the upper end of the scale, but not necessarily exceeding 50%”: Tillman v Attorney General (NSW) [2007] NSWCA 327; 70 NSWLR 448 at [89], followed in Cornwall v Attorney General (NSW) [2007] NSWCA 374. Whether that is to remain the accepted construction of the word in this context remains to be seen: The State of NSW v Fisk [2009] NSWSC 778 per Howie J at [24]. The alternative construction discussed in the authorities is that of McClellan CJ at CL in Attorney General (NSW) v Winters [2007] NSWSC 1071; 176 A Crim R 249 at [50] where his Honour held that “likely” in this context meant “more likely than not”. That is now the construction applied in Victoria: RJE V Secretary To The Department Of Justice, Attorney-General For Victoria And Victorian Human Rights & Equal Opportunity Commission [2008] VSCA 265, in contrast to the construction in TSL v Secretary to the Department of Justice [2006] VR 109 which was followed only for reasons of comity in Tillman v Attorney General (NSW). 7 As to the term “high degree of probability”, and the standard it requires in comparison with “likely”, the Court of Appeal said in Cornwall v Attorney General (NSW): 
     
      
       
        
        [21] The expression “a high degree of probability” indicates something “beyond more probably than not”; so that the existence of the risk, that is the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, does have to be proved to a higher degree than the normal civil standard of proof, though not to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, the risk or likelihood itself does not have to be a probability to the civil standard of proof, but rather a sufficiently substantial probability to satisfy the criterion “likely” as explained in  
        TSL 
        . 
        
       
      
    8 As to the second element of s 17(3), the Court in Cornwall v Attorney General (NSW) explained: 
     
      
       
        
        [22] On that approach, when one comes to the second element of s.17(3), what is required is satisfaction to a high degree of probability (that is, beyond a mere balance of probabilities) that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order; that is, that even if there is an extended supervision order, the offender will nevertheless still be likely to commit a further serious sex offence. 
        
       
      
    9 This requires a consideration of the nature of the proposed supervision and the controls and restrictions that would operate under it in order to determine its adequacy to meet the risk10 In considering these issues the primary object of the Act should be borne in mind. It is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community: s 3(1). Another object of the Act is to encourage serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation: s 3(2). 
     
      
    Stance taken by plaintiff and defendant 
     
      
    11 On behalf of the plaintiff it was submitted that I should make a continuing detention order for five years but if not persuaded that this was appropriate I should make an extended supervision order for five years. 
     
      
    12 On behalf of the defendant it was submitted that I would not be satisfied to a high degree of probability that he is a person who is likely to commit a further serious sex offence. Alternatively, it was submitted that if I was so satisfied, then I should make an extended supervision order for up to five years.The defendant’s offending history13 It is convenient to repeat the summary of the defendant’s offending history that I set out in the interim judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        [13] The defendant has a long history of committing criminal offences, particularly sexual assault offences. The sexual assault offending commenced with the assault of a 17 year old female on 21 December 1968 when the defendant was 21 years of age. 6 weeks after a good behaviour bond was imposed for that offence he committed an offence of buggery against a 23 year old female. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. He was released from custody in 1975 but in January 1978 committed an offence of rape against a 16 or 17 year old female for which he received a sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. He was released on parole in July 1981 but in November of that year committed an offence of sexual intercourse without consent. For that offence he was sentenced to 4 years 10 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 2 months. He was released on parole in August 1984. In November 1985 he committed an offence of indecent assault and was sentenced to imprisonment for 9 months. After his release in respect of that sentence he received other sentences, most notably a sentence of 15 years with a non-parole period of 11 years which was later quashed by the Court of Criminal Appeal when his appeal against conviction was allowed. Nevertheless, whilst he was on parole in respect of that sentence he committed an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent for which he was sentenced to 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. The sentence commenced on 12 July 1996. He was not granted parole and served the full-term of that sentence. 
         
         
        [14] The details of the earlier offences are sparse. The first offence [1968] involved the defendant kissing a 17 year old acquaintance and then, he said, “I got carried away and went too far”. He conceded that the complainant’s allegations of violence “could be right”. What he actually did is unknown. The next offence [1969] involved him dragging the 23 year old victim into his house, hitting her and then having forceful anal intercourse. The third offence [1978] arose from circumstances in which he and another man were travelling in a car and picked up the 16 or 17 year old victim, her 17 year old male friend and her 13 year old sister. They were driven into bushland against their wishes where the defendant dragged the victim into the bush, threatened her with a gun he claimed to have, and digitally penetrated her before having forced vaginal intercourse. The next offence [1981] occurred when the defendant was working as a bouncer at a disco. He met the 23 year old victim and bought her some drinks before she went home. He followed her home but on the way grabbed her and had forcible vaginal intercourse. A little over a year after being released on parole [1985] he met a woman at a social security office, left and travelled on the same bus with her and managed to persuade her to allow him to enter her home on being requested to provide him with a cup of tea. He grabbed her and fondled her breasts, threatening to “break every bone in (her) body” if she told the police. Fortunately he took heed of her distressed demands for him to leave the house. A month after a subsequent release on parole [1996] he committed perhaps the most serious of this catalogue of offences. He turned up unannounced at the home of the girlfriend of a former cellmate and persuaded her to invite him in for a cup of tea. He quickly produced a large carving knife and proceeded to commit a succession of sexual assaults over a period of about three hours, sometimes in the presence of the victim’s three year old son.  
        
       
      
    14 These offences are all quite serious. They involve victims who were women aged in their late teens to early twenties who were strangers or not well known to the defendant. They were assaulted in secluded or private locations and there was either actual or threatened violence over and above the sexual assault itself. They were generally opportunistic offences with little indication of any detailed planning with the possible exception of the 1996 offence during the course of which the defendant told the victim that he had been stalking her. 15 In sentencing the defendant for the last matter in 1996 his Honour Judge Phelan said that the defendant “cannot be ruled out as a future danger to society”. He referred to the need for a long term program for there to be any prospect of rehabilitation. He also made the following remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        I consider that I am dealing with a person who might well be able to manipulate many doctors, many psychiatrists and many of those who, in the past, have tried to assist him. ... I have certain reservations with a great deal of the conclusions that are expressed [in the doctors’ reports] because I think I am dealing with a highly manipulative man who is able to present what he wants to present in order to get the best interests out of it for himself. 
        
       
      
    16 Another notable feature of the defendant’s offending history is the number of times that he has reoffended soon after being released into the community under a form of conditional liberty, whether by way of good behaviour bond or parole. Extended supervision order imposed in 200817 In the interim judgment I made brief reference to the nature of some of the evidence that was before Adams J and the reasoning which led to his Honour making an extended supervision order as opposed to the continuing detention order sought by the State: 
     
      
       
        
        [15] The defendant has now spent close to 35 of the last 40 years in custody and there is material suggesting he is institutionalised.  
         
         
        [16] The material before me is largely the same as was before Adams J last year. I do not propose to set it out in any detail. I am grateful for the summary that appears in his Honour’s judgment. At the risk of doing a disservice to his Honour’s analysis, the situation may be briefly summarised. The defendant has an antisocial personality disorder and has exhibited behaviours as a manifestation of that disorder since his early teenage years. He has committed sexual offences, some of the utmost gravity with violence or threats of violence, on six occasions between 1969 and 1996. Offences have been committed whilst in the community on conditional liberty by way of good behaviour bond and parole. The most serious offence was the last which was committed only a month after parole release.  
         
         
        [17] The defendant has been assessed as being at high risk of re-offending. His credibility was found wanting by Adams J who said at least twice in his judgment that he did not believe him. In considering whether to release him under supervision or to make a continuing detention order, his Honour remarked that the fear of a return to prison if he did not fully comply with the conditions of a supervision order was powerful consideration in favour of making a supervision order, notwithstanding the defendant’s commission of serious offences in the past in breach of parole undertakings. He noted that the level of supervision and control to which the defendant could now be subjected was far greater than was possible in the past. He noted that the commission of any criminal offence, not just a serious sex offence, would result in the defendant being returned to prison. So too would the failure to comply with other stringent requirements of a supervision order. As a result, his Honour said that he was satisfied that, “supervision in accordance with the order and whilst he is resident in COSP accommodation is adequate to ensure that it is not likely that he will commit a further sex offence whilst under supervision”:  
        State of NSW v Thomas 
         (supra at [71]). The reference to “COSP” was to the Community Offender Support Program centre at Malabar. 
        
       
      
    Events after release on extended supervision order18 Given the requirement of s 17(4A) it is appropriate to also refer to the summary of the events which occurred following the release of the defendant on the extended supervision order made by Adams J: 
     
      
       
        
        [18] There were 29 conditions of the extended supervision order (ESO). They included that he accept the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service (which included the Community Compliance Group of the Department of Corrective Services), that he comply with any reasonable direction given by supervising officers, that he give advance notice of his proposed movements and obtain prior approval for any proposed change, and that he not possess or consume any illicit drugs. 
         
         
        [19] He was released from custody on 8 October 2008 and proceeded to the COSP centre. He disclosed in an induction interview that he had used cannabis the night before. He told the interviewing staff member that he needed to obtain some strong pain relief  
        “so will not smoke pot” 
        . He signed a document headed “Core Rules” which set out the rules that residents of COSP must comply with. They included that there was to be no smoking on the premises except in designated areas and not to bring on to the premises or have in possession any illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia.  
         
         
        [20] On 10 October 2008 the defendant acknowledged a number of requirements by signing a  
        “formal written direction” 
        . It included that he was “not to be in possession and or use …(a) prohibited drug or substance”. He acknowledged that breach of any of the directions in this document would be considered a breach of the ESO and could result in being returned to prison. 
         
         
        [21] A drug analysis test on 10 October 2008 was clear. 
         
         
        [22] In an Offender Intake Data Form completed on 29 October 2008 the defendant’s history included that he had smoked cannabis since the age of 9 and had been using that drug whilst in the prison at the rate of 16 grams per week. This document includes that in relation to his latest sexual offence he said that he had pleaded guilty but he was in fact not guilty. He alleged that he was “framed (set up by victim)”. 
         
         
        [23] On 22 November 2008 the defendant was abusive, argumentative and threatening towards an accommodation support worker over an issue of when he would complete some chores that had been assigned to him. 
         
         
        [24] The following day the same accommodation support worker recorded that the defendant had been argumentative about a request that he be permitted to leave the premises in order to visit a sick family friend at Woy Woy. He was told he would not be permitted to leave without prior approval of his schedule. He became abusive and threatened to kick the gate in if it was not opened for him. The author also noted that the defendant had been playing games and pushing boundaries. He had constantly been spoken to about sexualised comments to female staff, smoking within the buildings and failure to do chores properly. 
         
         
        [25] The Senior Compliance and Monitoring Officer of the Campbelltown Community Compliance Group (CCG) reported the defendant on 29 November 2008 for being in breach of his ESO. He had been found to be in possession of cannabis and implements used for ingesting the same. He admitted that he had been using cannabis away from the centre. The report also mentioned the defiant behaviour I have referred to above. It was recommended that the ESO be revoked. THC was detected in a drug test performed on 29 November 2008. On the evening of 29 November 2008 the offender was arrested and charged with failure comply with his ESO. He remained in custody until released on bail on 2 December 2008. 
         
         
        [26] Before returning to the COSP centre on the evening of 2 December 2008 the defendant was seen at the Westfield Eastgardens shopping centre asking members of the public for directions to Anzac Parade. He told a number of people that “he had just been released from jail for rape, and it was worth every minute of being in jail for the enjoyment he got out of what he had done”. 
         
         
        [27] Back at the COSP centre the defendant was searched. A small quantity of green matter was found which was subsequently surrendered by staff to the police. Four days later, on 6 December 2008 the defendant was again found to be in possession of a small quantity of green vegetable matter which was also surrendered to the police. On 8 December 2008 the defendant was arrested and charged in respect of his possession of 0.3 grams of cannabis leaf and also with failure to comply with the ESO. He was released on bail after appearing at Waverley Local Court on 9 December 2008. 
         
         
        [28] On 13 January 2009 the defendant was found to be in possession of items of clothing that were suspected of having been stolen. He was charged with an offence of goods in custody. The items of clothing comprised four T-shirts and five pairs of socks. He was also charged with failure to comply with the ESO. 
         
         
        [29] On 21 January 2009 the defendant wrote a “Statement of Request” which was said to be for “the right to live in peace for what life I have left”. Reference was made to him “trying to (do) my best to follow your unlawful laws”. It concluded: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          I would like to bring to your notice that you are wasting my short life and your sanity by trying to force me into anything unlawful. If these reasonable requests cannot be met could you please return my case to court ASAP. (Spelling errors corrected). 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [30] On 19 January 2009 the offender acknowledged by signing a “formal written direction” requirements that he not to go into any retail store without prior approval and that he fulfil the daily reporting condition of his bail undertaking by leaving the centre at 8.00am and return to the COSP centre no later than 9.30am. This had been preceded by a verbal direction to that effect on 15 January 2009. On 16 January 2009 he returned to the centre at 10.20am and he was in possession of items purchased at a retail store that had not been approved. On 19 January he returned at 10.09am. On 20 January he returned at 9.45am. On 21 January he was approved to attend an office of the Department of Housing at Maroubra between 1.00pm and 3.30pm. He returned at 4.20pm. He explained that he had been to Broadway to see Prisoners Aid in relation to obtaining a birth certificate. He did not have approval for this. His satellite tracking unit was not operational and appeared to have gone flat. It is said that this can be caused by incorrect or insufficient charging by the offender. On 22 January the offender reported to Maroubra police as required at 9.07am. Rather than returning to the centre he proceeded to go to the Sydney CBD where he was located at various locations. He returned to the centre at 3.25pm. These matters all constituted breaches of conditions of the ESO (conditions 1, 3 and 4) that he accept supervision and guidance for the term of the order, that he comply with any reasonable direction, and that he inform his supervising officer of movements in advance on a weekly basis and obtain prior approval for any proposed change.  
         
         
        [31] On 21 January 2009 the defendant’s tracking device was located in the grass in front of his room in the rain. Apparently a tracking device left in the rain has a likelihood of malfunctioning. This was a breach of a condition of the ESO (condition 8) that he comply with all instructions in relation to the operation of the equipment and must not tamper with or remove such equipment. For this, and the other breaches referred to earlier, it was recommended on 23 January 2009 that the ESO be revoked immediately. 
         
         
        [32] On 22 January 2009 he was charged with failure to comply with his ESO on 16 January 2009. Bail was refused. He has been in custody since that date. After he was taken into custody he was found to be in possession of some items of jewellery. A charge of goods in custody was preferred.  
         
         
        [33] On 12 May 2009 the offences of goods in custody and failure to comply with the ESO of 13 January 2009 came before Waverley Local Court. The latter offence was dismissed but for the former the defendant was sentenced to 1 month imprisonment from 22 January 2009. 
         
         
        [34] On 23 June 2009 the offence of goods in custody in relation to the jewellery was dealt with at Central Local Court and a 2 month term of imprisonment dating from 22 January 2009 was imposed. 
         
         
        [35] All of the other outstanding charges were determined at Waverley Local Court on 17 July 2009. He was convicted of the offences of failing to comply with the ESO on 29 November, 6 December 2008 and 16 January 2009 and sentenced in each case to imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of 9 months with all sentences specified to commence on 22 January 2009. For the offence of possessing a prohibited drug on 6 December 2008 there was a sentence of 3 months commencing on the same date. 
        
       
      
    Participation in treatment or rehabilitation programs19 The defendant has only participated to conclusion in one sex offender treatment program, being the nine week Introductory Sex Offender Redirection Training program in 2001. He is reported to have experienced difficulties in engaging with the program, primarily because of his claimed inability to recall events and his unwillingness to accept responsibility for his offending behaviour. The report included that he had no concept of victim empathy and, rather, projected a great deal of disparaging comment towards the victim. He was regarded as a “high risk, most dangerous individual”.20 When subject to an interim detention order last year the defendant undertook the Pre Treatment Program in response to a suggestion by Adams J. This is described as a motivational and psycho-educational program aimed at increasing an offender’s motivation and readiness to participate in a sex offender treatment program. He participated in five of six sessions between 13 August and 21 September 2008. He is reported to have been involved in group discussions and to have made a positive, if superficial, contribution. It was concluded that the program was beneficial to the defendant although he obviously did not receive the full benefit of the program because he was released before he had reached the stage of discussing his own offending behaviour. 21 The defendant also engaged in six individual treatment sessions with a specialist psychologist during the same period. He was reported to have engaged in the process and developed some insight, although his denial of some offences and claimed non-recollection of others was said to have been a barrier to a fuller understanding of his offending. 22 The Custodial Based Intensive Treatment (“CUBIT”) program is an 8 to 10 month program with a level of intensity said to be commensurate with international best practice. It has been available since 1999. The defendant has persistently refused to undertake this program because, he has claimed, he does not want to mix with paedophiles. The general consensus amongst the experts in the 2008 proceedings and now (except for one expert, Dr Jeremy O’Dea, who did not address the issue) is to the effect that there is no physical or mental impediment to the defendant engaging in the CUBIT program. The only impediment seems to be his willingness to do so. Risk Assessment Report by Patrick Sheehan, psychologist23 Mr Patrick Sheehan, Senior Specialist Psychologist in the Serious Sex Offenders Review Group of Corrective Services NSW has provided a Risk Assessment Report. He made an extensive review of the defendant’s conduct following his release last year and concluded that the extended supervision order was not a success in assisting the defendant to make a controlled adjustment to community life. In his view the defendant displayed an ambivalent attitude to his performance under supervision, stating, “I fucked it. I threw it away” and “I believe I reoffended because I wanted to come back to gaol”. That said, it is also notable that the defendant did not take any responsibility for the conduct which constituted breaches of the order, either denying the events, claiming to have been set up, or attributing them to an innocent misunderstandings. 24 Mr Sheehan observed that it was difficult to accurately gauge the defendant’s attitude to his risk of sexual recidivism, given his denial and minimisation of offending. He did not consider the denial to be directly relevant to the defendant’s risk of reoffending but considered that it inhibited the capacity of supervising and support personnel to manage his risk. The defendant offered the assurance that “I will never rape anyone again, I know that for a fact” but that is of little comfort because of his inability to articulate an understanding of factors that give rise to the risk of reoffending. 25 Mr Sheehan noted the limited treatment that the defendant has undertaken and considered that such programs that he had completed would not have had the intensity and duration required to meet his criminogenic needs. He considered that the defendant’s ongoing difficulties in self-regulating his behaviour when under supervision tended to show that the treatment interventions have not successfully facilitated enduring change. 26 The defendant is now 62 years old and his health is rather poor and so it might be thought that these factors would ameliorate the risk of reoffending. However, Mr Sheehan noted the defendant’s ongoing expression of antisocial behaviour into later life which is at odds with his age.27 The Static-99 instrument was applied by Mr Sheehan and it yielded a score of 7. This was later downgraded to 4 after recent research established that older offenders tend to re-offend less over time, leading to the development of Static-99R. A score of 7 under Static-99 indicated a “high presumptive risk level relative to other adult male sexual offenders”. In the sample population, sexual offenders with a score of 7 showed 3.44 times the recidivism rate of a “typical sexual offender”. However, reducing the score to 4 under Static-99R still places the defendant in the “moderate to high” risk range. The Static-99 and Static-99R instruments are of limited utility as a recidivism predictive tool and, as pointed out by Dr Jeremy O’Dea in a report I refer to below, it measures the risk of an individual engaging in a further sexual offence rather than a further “serious sex offence” as defined in the Act. I propose to take into account the assessments made with the use of this statistical tool, indeed I am required to by s 17(4)((d), but I propose to give them significantly less weight than I will give to assessments made by consideration of the individual circumstances of Mr Thomas’ case.28 In a review of various dynamic risk factors Mr Sheehan noted that the defendant has exhibited lifelong deficits in his ability to self regulate in the community, demonstrated most recently by the period of supervision 12 months ago. He considered that with ongoing support and concerted effort the defendant could improve his self regulation, but without such support he was likely to continue to approach life challenges with the same repertoire of behaviours. 29 The history of sexual offending was thought to be suggestive of difficulties in sexual self regulation. Mr Sheehan noted that the episodes of sexual offending occurred in the context of an antisocial personality disorder and he thought that the defendant would be more at risk when experiencing difficulties copying, including when he experiences acute anxiety, ongoing feelings of depression and/or low self worth, leading to maladaptive coping strategies such as drinking alcohol, aggressive behaviour and/or egocentric thinking and behavioural style, including feelings of sexual entitlement. Some of these features were exhibited during the recent period of supervision. This constellation of factors may, in Mr Sheehan’s view, predispose the defendant to high risk scenarios, increasing the risk of eventually acting out sexually and reducing his chance of fulfilling his stated desire of living responsibly. Mr Sheehan is of the opinion that “the overall totality of evidence suggests that Mr Thomas remains in the high risk category of sexual offending relative to other adult male sexual offenders”. 30 It is Mr Sheehan’s opinion that little appears to have changed regarding the defendant since the previous application determined by Adams J. He stated that the prospect of effectively managing the defendant’s risk of sexually offending in the future poses some difficult challenges. 31 If a continuing detention order is made, Mr Sheehan regards the best possible outcome being for the defendant to complete the CUBIT program. However he felt that it was unclear whether the defendant would consent to this, given his history of avoiding that program.32 If an extended supervision order is made with similar conditions to the previous order, Mr Sheehan considers it may be unlikely that the defendant would successfully complete it. He regards requiring the defendant to reside in a COSP home and being subject to standard monitoring and other restrictions as an effective way of managing risk in the immediate term but questions this as a long term strategy given the likelihood of the defendant failing to comply and being returned to custody. Mr Sheehan’s report includes discussion of the possibility of designing an order in such a way that the defendant is not breached and returned to custody for the minor infractions he is likely to make. He also suggests that residing somewhere other than a COSP residence may result in less reactive defiance which is a feature of the defendant’s antisocial personality disorder. As to this, Mr Sheehan writes: 
     
      
       
        
        Whilst such measures may adversely affect risk in the short term by reducing intensity of supervision, it may increase Mr Thomas’ ability to work towards some positive goals without being preoccupied with authority-based conflict. I note that such recommendations are made from a psychological perspective and do not account for the legal or policy-based realities involved in managing offenders in the community. 
        
       
      
    33 Mr Sheehan recommends that any management plan be minimally restrictive but rather supportive and encouraging of a balanced and responsible lifestyle. He adds in relation to this that the level of restriction and autonomy afforded to the defendant should remain dynamic, reflecting changes in his own ability to manage his risk behaviour as evidenced by his behaviour over time. Report by Professor Greenberg34 Professor David Greenberg was one of two psychiatrists appointed by the Court on 20 October 2009 to interview the defendant and provide a report. Professor Greenberg interviewed the defendant on 2 and 15 October, presumably in anticipation of being appointed. He was one of the Court appointed psychiatrists in respect of the proceedings before Adams J last year.35 In his 2008 report Professor Greenberg made a diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder with borderline traits as well as Panic Disorder. He did not diagnose the defendant with a sexual disorder and found that his primary motive for sexual offending was sexual gratification. He said that the defendant “believes that he has the right to have sex with women”. He found that the defendant was in the “high risk” category for further sexual offending. It was his view that the defendant’s prognosis was “generally guarded at this time without significant changes to his pattern of maladaptive behaviours”. Whilst he foresaw a partial reduction in the risk of re-offending if there was successful treatment, he was still of the view that the defendant would remain “a relatively high risk for re-offending in the short term”. 36 Professor Greenberg asked the defendant in his recent interviews about his performance under the supervision order and the various breaches of its conditions. As he did with Mr Sheehan, the defendant had either an excuse, a denial, or an explanation that there had been misunderstandings. However, when he asked the defendant generally about the difficulties he had complying with the various conditions the response was that he offended in order to come back to prison. He said that he felt safe whilst in custody. He did not see being sent back to prison as a punishment but, rather, punishment was being sent out into the community - “Gaol is me world. The outside world scares the shits out of me”. Somewhat paradoxically, he also said that if he was sent back to a COSP residence he would abide by the rules in the future and claimed that if he were to be kept in custody for a further detention period he would feel he is being punished for something he has not done.37 Professor Greenberg explored the defendant’s attitude to treatment. He told the professor that he could not undergo the CUBIT program because “there was no two-out system”. He claimed that he needed to be in a shared cell because he had a tendency to collapse and potentially have a heart attack. Another potential hurdle to undergoing the CUBIT program is that participants are required to acknowledge their guilt for their offences. The defendant told Professor Greenberg that he would admit to being guilty for his offences although he was unwilling, or unable, to give details of the individual offences. Then, again somewhat paradoxically, the defendant is reported to have said that he “wanted to be released and was sick and tired of doing time for crimes he’s never done”. 38 The defendant told Professor Greenberg that he was of no risk of sexual reoffending. He claimed to have no sex drive. The professor had to push the defendant to articulate the factors which contributed to his past sexual offending and he ultimately stated, “stupidity, alcohol and nothing else”. 39 On the prospect of complying with a further supervision order the defendant told Professor Greenberg that, “I’ll pull me head in and abide (by) rules and regulations and live a normal life”. However, he also stated that he had a problem with authority and did not like people telling him what to do. The defendant sought to assure the professor that he would not reoffend, sexually or otherwise. However, Professor Greenberg reports that the defendant’s “insight remained poor with regard to his severe personality problems and associated risks for reoffending both sexually and in general terms”. 40 Professor Greenberg offered the following diagnoses: 
     
      
       
        
        Axis I: 1. Polysubstance Abuse (historical)(Cannabis Abuse current) 
         
        2. Panic Disorder, query agoraphobia 
         
         
        Axis II: Antisocial Personality Disorder with Borderline Traits 
         
        
       
      Axis III: Physical 
       
        
         
          
          1. Cardiomyopathy with mitral valve regurgitation 
           
          2. Chronic Obstructive airways disease (emphysema) 
           
          3. Gastric Reflux 
           
          4. Hepatitis C 
          
         
        
       
      Axis IV: Stressors – defer 
       
        
       
      Axis V: Global assessment of functioning - defer 
      
    41 He concluded that the defendant’s psychiatric and physical status remained largely unchanged from the assessment made in 2008. He offered the opinion that the defendant breached the conditions of the earlier extended supervision order for four reasons: 
     
      
       
        
        1. His Antisocial Personality Disorder, where there is an enduring persistent chronic pattern of maladaptive behaviour which is by nature chronic and difficult to change. 
         
         
        2. Mr Thomas has become institutionalized and has significant fears about living in the community. He reports that he prefers prison as it is a safe haven for him and the community placement was frightening for him. 
         
         
        3. Mr Thomas probably has a psychological dependence on cannabis which he claims he uses for pain relief but he is probably using it for his stress-related symptoms (anxiety) and for recreational pleasurable purposes. 
         
         
        4. Mr Thomas’ motivation for changes to his patterns of maladaptive behaviour is in my view questionable.  
        
       
      
    42 Professor Greenberg reports that the defendant’s enduring patterns of maladaptive behaviours likely persisted throughout his most recent 12 year gaol term and more recent placement at a COSP home and there is nothing to suggest there has been any significant change. Whilst it might be expected that there would be a decline of these maladaptive behaviours with the aging process and deteriorating physical health, there was thus far nothing to indicate that this was anything more than minimal. 43 Professor Greenberg’s opinion is that “very little has changed since my last psychiatric interview and the likelihood of Mr Thomas committing a further ‘serious sex offence’ relative to other sex offenders, if released into the community and not kept under supervision, remains in the high risk category”. The defendant’s primary diagnostic motivation for sexual offending is his antisocial personality disorder. The professor reported that such personality disorders are extremely difficult to treat as their maladaptive behaviours are enduring, chronic and persistent. He also indicated that there are no known community based sex offenders treatment programs suitable for the defendant at this time. 44 It was noted that anti-libidinal medication is not an option for the defendant because his physical ill-health has features which would provide an unacceptable risk of adverse effects. 45 If an extended supervision order is made, Professor Greenberg recommends that the conditions be the same as those imposed by Adams J with the only alteration being that the term be for a period of several years rather than one year. One year, in his opinion, was insufficient for there to be meaningful changes to the defendant’s personality structure or patterns of maladaptive behaviour. However, Professor Greenberg also reports that in his view the likelihood of further failures to comply with an extended supervision order would be “very high” because of three factors, the defendant’s severe personality disorder, his stated wish to remain in custody, and his psychological addiction to cannabis. Later in his report he stated: 
     
      
       
        
        (S)hould Mr Thomas be placed on an “Extended Supervision Order”, I have already stated that I am of the view that it should be for a period of several years up to the maximum of a five-year period because of the entrenched pervasive pattern of maladaptive behaviours. Any treatment program attempting to decrease his risk for sexual re-offending would need to be considered as a longer-term treatment plan. I am therefore of the view that a period closer to five year maximum period would not be unreasonable in Mr Thomas’ situation given his past repeated failures with Probation and Parole and other Court Orders. Should he be placed on an “Extended Supervision Order”, he will require assistance with regard to life skills and coping skills to assist him with his de-institutionalization. There would be in my view significant challenges with his anti-authoritarian traits and his current questionable motivations to make meaningful changes to his personality structure. Although his prognosis is guarded at this time, Mr Thomas has had very little if not negligible interventions to address his psychiatric and psychological problems to date. Further efforts are therefore required to assist him with his re-integration back into the community. 
        
       
      
    46 Professor Greenberg offers that if the defendant is to be made the subject of a continuing detention order then in order that he undertake various programs and that he obtain assistance with social, coping and life skills, the duration of the order should be of a sufficient period for him to undertake such programs. He alludes to the possibility that the defendant may need to undertake a further preparatory program before he attempted to undertake the ten month CUBIT program. Report by Dr Jeremy O’Dea47 Dr Jeremy O’Dea was the other Court appointed psychiatrist. He had also provided reports for the proceedings before Adams J last year and interviewed the defendant again on 29 October 2009. He expressed the opinion last year that the defendant had a “significantly high risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours on his release into the community in the long term”. He noted, however, that risk assessment was not sufficiently accurate to predict with sufficient precision the defendant’s likelihood of sexually reoffending. 48 Dr O’Dea received an account from the defendant concerning the various breaches of conditions of his extended supervision order which was similar to what he had told Mr Sheehan and Professor Greenberg. That is, the defendant made a series of excuses or denials. 49 Also consistent with what he had told Professor Greenberg, the defendant told Dr O’Dea that he regarded it as punishment to place him in the community, not in gaol, but he then also said that he wanted to leave the prison system because he had had enough. He indicated that he wanted to go to the Campbelltown COSP residence rather than to the one at Malabar and indicated that he would abide by all the rules and regulations. He said, “If I don’t do it I will never get out of this joint ... I will have to go through this bullshit year after year ... it’s just their rules and regulations that go against the grain”. 50 Dr O’Dea found no significant shift in the defendant’s clinical presentation between his interview in October 2009 and those in June and July 2008. He continues to consider that the defendant’s primary psychiatric problems relate to his personality that remains best understood as an antisocial personality disorder characterised by a history of repetitive antisocial behaviours from at least his early teenage years with ongoing problems with lack of remorse and lack of insight and engagement in his management problem. He found that the defendant’s antisocial personality traits do not appear to have become attenuated to an adequate degree with his increasing age. 51 Dr O’Dea considered the defendant’s alcohol and cannabis abuse issues, his complaints of experiencing anxiety and depression, and his general medical condition and then said, “I do not consider that Mr Thomas’ full clinical psychiatric risk assessment and attendant risk management considerations have substantially or significantly changed since my report (of) 10 July 2008”. In that report he found: 
     
      
       
        
        From a full clinical psychiatric risk assessment and risk management perspective, and as judged by actuarial risk assessment instruments (such as Static-99 in which Mr Thomas was scored at 8/12), Mr Thomas would be considered as having a significantly high risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours on his release into the community in the long term.  
        
       
      
    52 Dr O’Dea proceeded to make some observations about the limited utility of Static-99 before then stating: 
     
      
       
        
        Overall, I do not consider that the current evidence regarding the assessment of risk in these matters is sufficiently accurate to predict with sufficient precision Mr Thomas’ likelihood of engaging in further sex offending behaviours on release into the community. 
        
       
      
    53 In his current report, Dr O’Dea maintained that on actuarial risk assessment instruments the defendant is considered as having a “significantly high risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours on his release into the community in the long term”. However, he once again referred to the shortcomings of the Static-99 instrument including, as I mentioned earlier, that it measures the risk of further sexual offending rather than the risk of committing a further “serious sex offence”. Dr O’Dea noted the relatively recent recognition in Static-99R that the risk of re-offending reduces with age but added that all of the shortcomings still apply. So, whilst the assessment of the defendant at a score that indicated he fell in the “moderate-high risk group”, Dr O’Dea opined that “it is his general physical health in addition to his age that is likely to more significantly modulate his risk of committing a further serious sex offence on his release into the community”. 54 It seems that Dr O’Dea’s preference is, rather than placing too much reliance upon actuarial risk assessments, that the “focus should remain on the appropriate and adequate management of specific dynamic risk factors in a structured and supervised management program on Mr Thomas’ release into the community”. These risk factors are said to include the potential for the defendant to experience sexually deviant urges or fantasies in the future, his alcohol and cannabis use, his personality, and his attitude to women and sexuality as evidenced by his interpersonal functioning and sexual relations. 55 Compelling the defendant to participate in the CUBIT program or detaining him for a further period in custody were not thought likely, in and of themselves, to be measures that would significantly reduce the risk of the defendant engaging in further sex offending behaviours on release into the community.56 Dr O’Dea regards it as appropriate that upon release into the community the defendant should have regular and long term consultations with a suitably qualified forensic psychiatrist or psychologist to explore his sexuality in general and his sexual offending behaviour in particular as well as focussing upon other dynamic risk factors. Dr O’Dea indicates that he is aware of a number of professionals who would be able to offer such a service and who would be prepared to work in conjunction with the corrective services personnel. Accordingly, he concludes that a community based treatment program, in conjunction with supervision and monitoring, is the most appropriate intervention to manage and minimise the risk of the defendant engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community in the long term.57 Dr O’Dea identifies a significant risk of further problems with cannabis use but feels that the likely impact of substance use on the defendant’s risk of reoffending could be minimised with a structured and supervised treatment and monitoring program in place. 58 Dr O’Dea’s report concludes: 
     
      
       
        
        Dependent on his advancing age and the progress of his general medical condition, Mr Thomas’ current risk factors requiring specific management are likely to be longer term issues and of at least 5 years duration. That being said, regular review of his general medical status and so called dynamic risk factors at least every 6 to 12 months is likely to enable more adequate and appropriate interventions as time progresses. 
        
       
      
    Other assessments as to the likelihood of a further serious sex offence59 Ms Suzanne Dumasia, a departmental psychologist, assessed the defendant in January 2008 and concluded that he was in the high risk category for sexually reoffending relative to other adult males. She raised a question, however, as to whether his medical condition “may reduce or increase his future risk of either violent reoffending or sexual abuse”. A report was then obtained by the State from Professor David Richards, cardiologist, who confirmed that the defendant remained capable of sexually assaulting a woman and using violence to do so.60 Mr Jayson Ware, psychologist stated in his affidavit of 14 July 2008 that research showed that antisocial orientation is one of the two strongest predictors of sexual recidivism. As indicated in the reports of Professor Greenberg and Dr O’Dea, the defendant has been diagnosed with an antisocial personality disorder. Mr Ware also identified the defendant’s anxiety as an acute dynamic risk factor and he noted the fact that he experienced anxiety in the weeks and months leading up to the 1996 sexual assault. He said this is “evidence of his increased risk should he experience anxiety or other mood difficulties”.Other relevant matters61 The first of other matters that are relevant to the issues for determination is the defendant’s physical health. As noted earlier, he has cardiomyopathy. He was fitted with a pacemaker in January 2005. He has emphysema. Despite these conditions Professor Greenberg noted no shortness of breath or distress in his 2008 assessment and in his recent interviews he noted no observable shortness of breath. The defendant has also been diagnosed with hepatitis in the past but liver function testing has yielded results within the normal range. He claimed to have fallen twice whilst living at the COSP residence but testing that followed did not reveal anything of significance. 62 There have been regular claims made by the defendant over the years to having experienced memory loss following brain injury and multiple strokes. He told Ms Dumasia, Professor Greenberg and Dr O’Dea that he could remember nothing of his sex offences. In the course of committing the sexual assault in 1996 he told the victim that he could manipulate the authorities by claiming that he had amnesia. When he was subsequently interviewed by police he denied the offence, said he did not know the victim and claimed to have amnesia.63 Testing by a number of professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, a neurologist and a neuro-psychologist has found no objective evidence to support the claims of memory loss. There is reasonable cause to suspect that these claims have been feigned. The defendant claimed to have been assaulted in prison in 1991 by being hit with an iron bar and sustained a fractured skull but there is no record of any such assault having taken place. He told Professor Greenberg that he was unconscious for several days following the incident. Medical records do show that in 1991 he had a fall in a prison yard and bruised his forehead. He was hospitalised and diagnosed with a fractured temporal bone but according to the records there was no unconsciousness following admission, nor did he have seizures. Dr Wayne Reid, a clinical neuropsychologist reported in 1995 that the defendant’s brain functioning had been assessed as normal following his 1991 admission to hospital. He also found that he suffered no memory deficits or problems in retaining verbal or visual information. Dr Paul Spira, a consultant neurologist examined the defendant last year and concluded that he was a “cognitively intact man who is able to follow complex reasoning”. At one point in his interview with Professor Greenberg last year the defendant said that he did not want to remember his past. 64 Medical assessments in 2005 and 2006 resulted in poor prognoses in terms of life expectancy, particularly because of the heart condition. A much better assessment was made following a cardiological assessment in 2008. The earlier assessments indicated a significant likelihood of a life expectancy of one to two years but Dr Richards’ opinion following the 2008 assessment was of a life expectancy of about ten years. Moreover, as indicated earlier, Dr Richards found that the defendant was still physically capable of sexually offending, of holding a knife and threatening a woman and that he was capable of arousal and of obtaining an erection. Professor Greenberg concluded in 2008 that “Mr Thomas’ physical status is therefore considered currently reasonably stabilised, although he generally remains in poor physical health. I am of the view that his current physical status would not preclude him from future sex offending behaviour”.65 The defendant’s mental state is a relevant matter to consider. I have previously referred to the opinions of Professor Greenberg and Dr O’Dea as to the defendant having an antisocial personality disorder. At a superficial level the defendant’s age might be thought to be a factor tending to attenuate the risk of reoffending. This has been recognised recently in scoring under Static-99R actuarial tool. However, Mr Sheehan, Professor Greenberg and Dr O’Dea all found this to be of little significance in the defendant’s case because of the ongoing presence of the antisocial personality disorder. The discussion of this aspect by Howie J in the State of New South Wales v Fisk, supra, at [180] – [183], the defendant in that case being 61 years of age, is illustrative of the point that advancing age does not necessarily mean there is a reduced risk of reoffending in a particular case.66 Cannabis use has been an enduring feature of the defendant’s life. There is material to the effect that he has used this drug since the age of 9 and whilst in prison prior to his last release he was using 16 grams per week. I indicated earlier that Professor Greenberg made the Axis I diagnosis of polysubstance abuse. Cannabis use has been associated with previous sexual offending. In discussing the 1978 bushland rape of a 16 or 17 year old woman, the defendant told Dr Reid, psychiatrist, that he could remember nothing because he had been drinking alcohol and smoking opium and “pot”. 67 Professor Greenberg was of the view that the use of alcohol and cannabis would probably have a disinhibiting affect upon the defendant’s maladaptive behaviours and increase his risk of committing a further serious sex offence when considered in conjunction with other risk factors (antisocial personality disorder, problems with general self regulation, negative social attitudes, intimacy deficits, depressed mood and low self-esteem). 68 I note that there is material suggesting that the defendant has not consumed alcohol for many years. He has, after all, been in custody for a long time. He claimed to Dr O’Dea that he did not consume any alcohol during his release into the community last year. I am unable to determine whether that is true. 69 There is a marked contrast in what the offender said to Professor Greenberg and Dr O’Dea about recent cannabis use. Dr O’Dea has reported that the defendant “was adamant to me that he had not smoked cannabis since his release from custody, neither at the COSP centre nor in the community, and that he had not smoked cannabis since his return to custody, with his most recent use of cannabis being on 8 October 2008” (emphasis added). The positive drug test, he being found in possession of both cannabis and implements for smoking it, and his admission to having used the drug away from the COSP home all indicate that the former was untrue. Professor Greenberg asked the defendant whether he continued to smoke cannabis whilst in custody and he reports that “he claimed that he is smoking half a gram per day”. 70 Dr O’Dea concluded that there was a “significant risk of further problems with cannabis use in the future” but also concluded that the likely impact of substance use on the risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours, or of committing a further serious sex offence, could be minimised with a structured and supervised treatment, supervision and monitoring program in place. Safety of the community71 The safety of the community is the first of the factors listed in s 17(4) and, having regard to the primary object of the Act in s 3(1) (ensuring the safety and protection of the community), must be regarded as the most important.72 I have referred in detail to the reports of Professor Greenberg, Dr O’Dea and Mr Sheehan but there are some other expert opinions to which reference should be made.73 Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, observed in the 1996 sentence proceedings: 
     
      
       
        
        Dangerousness is very difficult to predict, as you know. The best predictor of future violence is previous violence, so on that parameter alone, as you say, his prognosis is not particularly good. The other disturbing factor, I guess, is his age. He is 49, I think, and if he has an anti-social personality disorder one would have anticipated a degree of settling of his aggression with advancing years. … So there is a possible favourable prognostic sign, the process of ageing. In terms of personality maturation I don’t think we can put much store by that occurring without assistance … In view of the fact that this man has such severe institutionalisation, if his reoffending risk is to be reduced he requires, I think, quite an extensive rehabilitation program.  
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Recidivist sex offenders can be rehabilitated. A lot depends, really, on the nature of the offending behaviour … Where you have people who engage in repeated acts of rape, male against female, the prognosis is, generally, not good. Without that person receiving very extensive psychological treatment because it suggests that their value of other people, particularly women, is low. 
        
       
      
    74 Dr Hugh Jolly, psychologist, reported in 1984: 
     
      
       
        
        He is one of those men who rather believes that sex is there as his right, and for his taking. … I wonder really whether Thomas has the capacity to change. … It seems to me that the man will pose some danger to the community – in a way – for the rest of his life. 
        
       
      
    75 Dr Arnaud Reid, consultant psychiatrist, stated in a 1978 report that the defendant had an “impulsive, aggressive personality”. 76 Dr Westmore mentioned the need for the defendant to undergo “an extensive rehabilitation program”. Regrettably the defendant has not engaged in any program of that description. 77 The defendant’s repeated sexual offending whilst in the community on conditional liberty raises significant cause for concern about the safety of the community if he is to again be released, even under some form of supervision. One of the issues for determination is whether adequate supervision can be provided to sufficiently reduce the risk. Performance by the defendant under the previous extended supervision order was poor in terms of compliance with conditions. It must be noted, however, that there is no evidence of any actual threat to the safety of any member of the public. The breach which concerns me the most was the occasion when the defendant travelled to and around the Sydney CBD without permission. That he was prepared to commit a breach of this nature raises a question about the adequacy of a supervision order. No matter the strictness of the conditions he was still prepared to go where he chose and when he chose.78 Adams J was satisfied that there was “undoubtedly a risk of reoffending” but the following reasoning seems to have persuaded him to make an extended supervision order: 
     
      
       
        
        I am quite sure that he is most anxious to be released from gaol and not to return. The fear of such a return if he does not fully comply with the conditions of a supervision order is, to my mind, a powerful one in his case although I appreciate that in the past he repeatedly committed serious offences in breach of his parole undertakings. The level of supervision and control to which he can now be subjected, however, is far greater than was possible then. Breach of a supervision order does not involve the commission of any serious sex offence. The commission of any criminal offence or, for that matter, a failure to comply with the other stringent requirements of the supervision order will, as the defendant understands, result in his return to prison. In this regard, the supervision order which I made is a world apart from the regime to which he was subjected on parole. I was therefore satisfied that supervision in accordance with the order and whilst he is resident in COSP accommodation is adequate to ensure that it is not likely that he will commit a further sex offence whilst under supervision. 
        
       
      
    Summary of findings79 The defendant’s history shows that he has been a dangerous and violent sex offender.80 He is now aged 62 and his physical health is not the best. However, the degree to which these factors might attenuate the risk of reoffending is relatively minimal.81 The defendant has not completed any significant rehabilitation programs. He has persistently avoided doing so. There is the barest glimmer of hope that he may be willing to undertake the CUBIT program but this is with stated reluctance. If he were to undertake that program, there is little cause for optimism that he would successfully complete it. He has thus far unremittingly refused to make an appropriate acknowledgement of his past offending behaviour.82 The defendant has not expressed any real insight into the causes of his offending behaviour and there is no evidence of him having a genuine desire to explore and confront the underlying issues.83 The defendant is an unreliable historian. This is apparent from the judgment of Adams J and I have referred to some examples of his inconsistent responses in the course of this judgment. As a consequence, assurances that he has given about no longer being a risk, no longer having a sex drive, and the like, must be assessed with considerable scepticism.84 Expert appraisals by Professor Greenberg and Mr Sheehan have led to opinions being expressed that the defendant remains in the high risk category for committing a further serious sex offence if released into the community relative to other sex offenders. Dr O’Dea was less precise in his assessment of the risk of reoffending, although it can at least be said that he acknowledged that there was a risk.85 The stringent conditions of the extended supervision order made by Adams J did not have the effect of enforcing the defendant’s compliance through the risk of being returned to custody. His breaches of that order were so many, so frequent, and so soon after being released, that one can have no confidence that he would be completely compliant with the terms of any future order.Conclusions86 On the basis of these findings I have reached the following conclusions.87 I am satisfied that there is a high degree of probability that the defendant is likely (on either of the constructions of that word discussed earlier) to commit a further serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision.88 I am also satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. Putting that another way in order to ensure my conclusion is clear, I am satisfied that there will still be a high degree of probability that the defendant is likely to commit a further serious sex offence even if he is made the subject of an extended supervision order.89 I propose to make a continuing detention order. 90 The maximum term of such an order is five years. I am not persuaded that there is cause to make an order for that length of time. I have alluded to a possibility that the defendant may be willing to engage in treatment programs in custody. That is not a reason to make a continuing detention order and I stress that it is not a factor I have taken into account in determining to make such an order. However, given there is a prospect of him doing so, and accepting the suggestion of Professor Greenberg, I have concluded that the appropriate length of such an order is one commensurate with the time that will be required for that purpose.Order91 I make the following orders: 
     
      
      1. An order pursuant to s 17(1)(b) of the  
      Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 
       2006 that the defendant be subject to a continuing detention order for 18 months from the date of this order. 
       
       
      2. An order pursuant to s 20(1) of the Act that the Court issue a warrant for the committal of the defendant to a correctional centre for the duration of the continuing detention order referred to in the previous order.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA: This appeal is brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions under section 5F(3A) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 concerning a ruling on admissibility of evidence made by a judge of the District Court. The ruling was given following a voir dire held before any jury was empanelled. The judge ruled that certain evidence that the Crown wished to call at the trial of a charge brought against the Respondent would not be admissible. The judge gave the ruling on 20 October 2009. This appeal has been brought on quickly, as the trial is due to commence on 15 February 2010. 
     
      
    2 So far as presently relevant, section 5F Criminal Appeal Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) This section applies to:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) proceedings (including committal proceedings) for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in … the District Court, and … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3A) The … Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) An appeal under this section shall, unless the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to adduce fresh, additional or substituted evidence, be determined on the evidence (if any) given in the proceedings to which the appeal relates. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) The Court of Criminal Appeal:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) may affirm or vacate the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) if it vacates the … decision or ruling, may give or make some other … decision or ruling instead of the … decision or ruling appealed against. …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    3 The Respondent accepts that this Court has jurisdiction to hear the present appeal.  
     
      
    4 The Notice of Appeal identifies the orders that the Crown seeks as: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. An order vacating the decision or ruling made by his Honour Judge Sorby. 
        
       
       
        
        2. An order that the evidence does have significant probative value and is admissible for the purpose of establishing that the accused has a tendency to act in a particular way. 
        
       
       
        
        3. An order that the evidence is admissible. 
        
       
       
        
        4. Such further or other orders as this Honourable Court thinks fit.” 
        
       
      
    5 The Respondent resists each of the first three orders sought. In the alternative, it submits that even if order 1 is made, orders 2 and 3 should be refused. 
     
      
       
      The Procedural Background 
       
      
    6 The Respondent was originally charged, by a single indictment presented in the District Court, with three different types of offence, namely: 
     
      
       
       Sexual intercourse with TL without consent on 14 January 2007. 
       
       
       Indecent assault of AG on or about 20 May 2007. 
       
       
       Indecent assault of ZM on or about 20 May 2007. 
       
      
    7 On 29 July 2008, the Crown had served on the Respondent’s solicitor a notice pursuant to section 97 Evidence Act 1995 of what it contended was a tendency of the Respondent. The Crown gave notice that it would be contending that, by reason of that tendency, evidence of each of TL, AG and ZM would be admissible against the Respondent on all counts of the indictment. 
     
      
    8 The Respondent brought a Notice of Motion dated 15 August 2008 in those District Court proceedings. It sought, in substance, that the sexual intercourse without consent charge be severed from the remaining counts on the indictment and tried separately, that the evidence in relation to TL be inadmissible in any trial concerning AG and ZM, and that the evidence in relation to AG and ZM be inadmissible in any trial concerning TL. 
     
      
    9 On 8 September 2008, his Honour Judge Sorby ruled that the sexual intercourse without consent count should be severed from the other counts, that the sexual intercourse without consent count be tried separately from the other counts, and that the evidence in relation to TL be inadmissible in any trial concerning AG and ZM. The transcript of the hearing does not reveal any ruling about whether the evidence in relation to AG and ZM would be admissible in any trial concerning TL. No reasons for judgment were delivered, and no formal orders or rulings were made.  
     
      
    10 The trial of the counts alleging indecent assault of AG and indecent assault of ZM proceeded on the next day. That trial resulted in the conviction of the Respondent on all counts. 
     
      
    11 On 10 March 2009, the Respondent was arraigned before his Honour Judge Berman on an indictment containing the remaining single charge, of sexual intercourse with TL without consent on 14 January 2007. The Crown asked the judge for a ruling that the evidence of AG and ZM was admissible as tendency evidence in the trial relating to TL. The Crown Prosecutor appearing before Judge Berman was a different prosecutor to the one who had appeared before Judge Sorby. The prosecutor told Judge Berman what his understanding was of the rulings that Judge Sorby had made. The transcript continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: I understand. His Honour decided that the evidence in relation to the events of 14 January 2007 could not be used as tendency evidence in relation to the events of May 2007, is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s my understanding, I wasn’t there-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But he didn’t decide the other way? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour.” 
        
       
      
    12 Counsel appearing for the Respondent before Judge Berman was the same counsel who had appeared for the Respondent before Judge Sorby. Judge Berman enquired of that counsel about the application made to Judge Sorby. Counsel told Judge Berman that the application was for severance of the counts,  
     
      
       
        
        “… and that the Crown be not permitted to adduce in the trial of the indecent assault counts evidence of TL-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But of course not the other way around because that was the trial that his Honour was dealing with at the time. 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL]: That’s right.” 
        
       
      
    13 After argument, Judge Berman delivered a judgment on 10 March 2009 in which he ruled that the evidence of AG and ZM was admissible in the trial concerning the alleged sexual assault of TL.  
     
      
    14 On 11 March 2009, the Respondent’s counsel – contrary to what had been asserted the previous day – expressed the view that Judge Sorby had made a ruling on 8 September 2008 by which his Honour excluded the evidence of AG and ZM in proceedings relating to TL. Counsel submitted that the ruling of Judge Berman should be revisited in light of section 130A Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (which, in broad terms, makes a pre-trial order made by a judge in sexual offence proceedings binding on a trial judge in those proceedings unless the trial judge decides otherwise). Counsel’s instructions were withdrawn by the Respondent, and the matter was adjourned without Judge Berman needing to consider any further the admissibility of the evidence of AG and ZM. 
     
      
    15 On 20 October 2009, the matter came before his Honour Judge Sorby. The Crown requested clarification of rulings he had made on 8 September 2008 concerning the admissibility of the evidence of AG and ZM. It was on 20 October 2009 that the judge delivered the judgment the subject of the present appeal. 
     
      
    16 Judge Sorby said that he had prepared detailed reasons after 8 September 2008, that were subsequently not required by the parties, in which he had decided “in the context of both trials the evidence of the three complainants should not be used as tendency evidence in either trial”. Those reasons were, it seems from the transcript, longhand reasons that had been disposed of once it became apparent that the parties did not require them. Judge Sorby said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… my detailed reasons were not handed down, and the transcript is unclear; not helped by the fact that the separate argument and the tendency submissions came mixed together, something I should have dealt with at the time to avoid any confusion. 
        
       
       
        
        Earlier this year Judge Berman of this court was asked to adjudicate on the tendency evidence point, having been erroneously advised that I had not made a ruling on tendency. He did so, handing down his decision on 10 March 2009. His ruling was that the proposed tendency evidence of the Crown had probative value and its probative value substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect it may have had on the accused. I have had the advantage of reading Judge Berman’s remarks and reasons. In view of the fact that Judge Berman was inadvertently not made aware of what I had decided, and in the interest of justice, I decided to revisit the question.” 
        
       
       
      Judge Sorby went on to hold that the evidence was not admissible. 
       
       
      The Substance of the Evidence in Question 
       
      
    17 Under this heading in the judgment I recount evidence but make no findings about it. 
     
      
    18 TL, who was aged 18 when she made a statement in June 2007, attended a barbeque at the Respondent’s home, probably on the evening of 13 January 2007. She had not met the Respondent before, and came to be attending because her friend A was a relative of the Respondent’s girlfriend. The Respondent was 36 years old at the time. The Respondent gave TL several drinks during the night and by the end of the night she felt “pretty drunk”. Between 2:00 am and 3:00 am on 14 January 2007, TL decided to go to bed. She saw the Respondent standing at the bathroom door as she was exiting the bathroom. Her head was spinning from the effects of alcohol. The Respondent guided her into a spare bedroom and placed her onto a single bed where she immediately went to sleep. She was wearing underpants, as well as some other items of clothing, when she went to sleep. 
     
      
    19 TL awoke sometime during the night with difficulty breathing. She realised the Respondent was lying on top of her and pressing down on her chest. He was having penile/vaginal intercourse with her. She tried to scream but was unable to. The Respondent placed his hand over her mouth and said, “Don’t tell [A]”. At that time A was asleep on a mattress on the floor in the same room. The Respondent withdrew and left the room. TL was in shock and passed out. TL later complained to police and made a statement on 3 June 2007. 
     
      
    20 ZM, who was aged 28, attended a party at the Respondent’s home on 19 May 2007. She was a friend and work colleague of the Respondent’s girlfriend, and had met the Respondent a few times previously. ZM consumed about seven drinks of Jim Beam and Coke. She decided to go to sleep soon after 3:00 am and lay “head to toe” with a man named P on the lounge. Her clothing at the time included track pants, and underpants. She woke up to the sensation of someone’s hand inside her underpants, rubbing her vagina. Her hand was also taken and placed on someone’s penis. ZM “fully woke up” and saw the Respondent beside the lounge and she pulled her hand away from him. By that time he was no longer touching her. She shook her head and pulled the blanket over her head twice until the Respondent went away. Prior to the Respondent leaving, ZM pinched P on the leg to try to rouse him but he didn’t wake up. ZM gave a statement to police on 3 June 2007. 
     
      
    21 AG, who was aged 20 in June 2007, also attended the party at the Respondent’s home on the evening of 19 May 2007. AG said that by the end of the night she was “pretty drunk and feeling very sleepy”. The Respondent’s girlfriend took her to a spare room and she slept on the bottom bunk of a set of bunk beds. She awoke to feel someone stroking her hair and kissing her face. She thought it might have been C, a man she once dated. She then felt someone touching her breast between her outer clothing and her underwear. She pulled the hand away. The man then grabbed her hand and placed it on his penis. She said, “fuck off” and pulled her hand away but then felt the man trying to undo the buttons on her jeans. She hit the hand away and said “fuck off” again. She turned towards the man and saw that it was the Respondent. AG gave a statement to police on 7 June 2007. 
     
      
    22 The Respondent was interviewed by police on 19 June 2007. The Respondent generally declined to answer questions but in relation to TL denied that sexual intercourse occurred.

        “55(1) The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        56(1) Except as otherwise provided by this Act, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible in the proceeding. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Evidence that is not relevant in the proceeding is not admissible. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        97(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        101(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        135 The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        137 In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    24 The Dictionary to that Act includes: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        probative value 
         of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. 
        
       
       
        
        tendency evidence 
         means evidence of a kind referred to in subsection 97(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in that subsection.” 
        
       
       
      The Tendency the Crown Asserts 
       
      
    25 The Crown served notice of its intention to adduce tendency evidence on 30 January 2009. It stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The tendency sought to be proved is his tendency to act in a particular way, namely to sexually assault and indecently assault women who are asleep in his home after they have been drinking alcohol.” 
        
       
      
    26 It identifies the precise parts of witness statements, and of the transcript of evidence given at the previous hearing, that the Crown alleges establish the tendency for which it contends. No complaint is made about the adequacy of this notice to fulfil the requirement of section 97(1)(a). 
     
      
    27 In the course of argument before his Honour Judge Sorby, the Crown refined somewhat the way it formulated the tendency. The judge identified the tendency that the Crown ultimately came to rely upon as being: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a tendency to act in a particular way, namely to sexually molest young women who (1) have stayed over at his house after attending a party, (2) have consumed a significant amount of alcohol, (3) are asleep, (4) where there is a risk of being discovered by others in the house.” 
        
       
       
      The Judgment Appealed From 
       
      
    28 Judge Sorby incorporated by reference into his judgment a table that the Crown had prepared that set out similarities and differences between the accounts of the three women.

         Yes: [The accused said]: “Are you sure.” – see para 13 of statement. 
         
         
         Accused ceased sexual contact when asked to stop by complainant. 
         No: the accused placed his hand over the mouth of the complainant and said “Shh” preventing her from talking or screaming. 
         Yes. 
         Yes – after the accused rubbed the complaint’s vagina the complainant tried to roll away. The accused then placed the complainant’s hand into his pants and on to his penis. The complainant pulled her hand away, looked at the accused and shook her head from side to side and said, “No.” the complainant covered her head with a blanket for a short while. When she uncovered her face from the blanket she saw the accused, he said, “Are you sure.” She shook her head from side to side, then closed her eyes and covered her face with the blanket. The accused walked away. – see para 13-14. 
         
        
       
      
    29 The judge recorded the Crown’s submission that the circumstances surrounding the alleged assaults had striking similarities, and that although the actual acts of sexual molestation of the three women were different, it would be “unduly narrow” to emphasise these differences as they only played a part in the overall pattern of behaviour. He recorded the submission of the Respondent that, “not only must the surrounding circumstances of the acts be similar, as they here are as demonstrated by the Crown’s schedule, but the various sexual activities must be similar as well …”. The judge referred to, but distinguished, the statement of Blanch J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J agreed) in R v Smith [2008] NSWCCA 247; (2008) 190 A Crim R 8 at 12-13 [17], where Blanch J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial judge did note the similarity of the surrounding circumstances but in addition to that, in my view, there were similarities in relation to the way the offences were alleged to have occurred. The significant feature of the complaint of TG was the fondling and stroking of her vagina and legs. The evidence relating to the first occasion where the respondent is charged with an offence against TM involved him stroking her vagina and touching her bottom before he inserted his finger in her anus. The evidence relating to the second occasion was that after he had put her hand on his penis and tried to pull her towards his penis, he began touching her vagina before he inserted his finger in her vagina. On the third occasion he was stroking her vagina before he inserted his finger in her vagina. In my view the virtually identical surrounding circumstances of all of these allegations and the similarities involved in carrying out the various activities involved in the allegations does lead to the conclusion that the evidence sought to be tendered by the Crown is admissible as tendency evidence. That conclusion is not frustrated simply by the fact that on some occasions the respondent went further than simply touching and fondling.” 
        
       
      
    30 Judge Sorby recorded a submission by counsel for the Respondent that the last sentence of this quotation from the judgment of Blanch J had to be seen in the factual context of that case, whereas in the case before Judge Sorby there was “a dramatic difference in the sexual molestation alleged to have occurred between the accused and [TL]” and that of which AG and ZM had complained. Judge Sorby set out the relevant parts of the statements of each witness, and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is a marked contrast in the events described by [AG] and [ZM] and that of [TL]. This is not a case where the offender whilst with [TL] ‘went further’. There is no evidence that anything else occurred other than what is set out in the statement, and to suggest otherwise would be speculation. Whilst not – for tendency to apply, the evidence need not demonstrate a tendency to commit a particular crime, the rule applies to evidence showing a tendency to ‘act in a particular way’. 
        
       
       
        
        In my view, such a particular way includes not only the general circumstances surrounding a specific act as set out here in the Crown’s schedule, but also as important the particular act or acts and the immediate circumstances around those act or acts that is alleged to have been committed by the accused. I have set out the specific acts earlier in this judgment. 
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion, the significant difference between what the jury found that the accused did to [ZM] and [AG] compared to what is alleged by the Crown the accused did to [TL], notwithstanding the considerable similarities and surrounding circumstances at the accused’s house on 14 January 2007 and 20 May 2007, as set out in the Crown’s schedule – that the similarities of the sexual interference on the two occasions are significantly different to such a degree that the proposed evidence of the Crown’s tendency does not amount to tendency and the application fails.” 
        
       
      
    31 Having found that the evidence, when taken together “does not amount to tendency”, his Honour did not go on to consider whether the evidence would have significant probative value, or the application of section 101(2) Evidence Act. 
     
      
    32 By comparison, his Honour Judge Berman had been satisfied that the evidence established a tendency on the part of the accused “to do something unusual, that is to indecently assault women who are asleep at his place after having attended a party there”. Judge Berman was satisfied that the evidence had significant probative value, and that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. 
     
      
       
      Interrelationship of  
      Evidence Act 
        
      Provisions Concerning Tendency Evidence 
       
      
    33 Before section 97 can operate, the evidence that is sought to be tendered must be relevant to a fact in issue, within the meaning of section 55. If the evidence is relevant, then section 56 makes it admissible, unless there is some other provision of the Evidence Act that makes it inadmissible. 
     
      
    34 One such provision of the Evidence Act that can make relevant evidence inadmissible is section 97(1). Section 97(1) operates as both an exclusionary, and an inclusory rule of evidence. If evidence is of the type referred to in the chapeau of section 97(1), that evidence is made inadmissible. To be of the type referred to in the chapeau of section 97(1) the evidence must satisfy two separate criteria. One concerns its content, namely that it be evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or of a tendency that the person has or had. The other concerns the forensic purpose that the evidence plays in the proceedings, namely that it is sought to be used to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind.  
     
      
    35 However, if each of paras (a) and (b) of section 97(1) is satisfied, the exclusionary rule stated in the chapeau does not apply (cf Jacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd [2000] FCA 1886; (2000) 106 FCR 51 at 63 [48].) 
     
      
    36 The provisions that I have been discussing so far under this heading apply equally to civil and criminal trials. In criminal trials, section 101(2) provides a separate restriction on the use of tendency evidence. Even if evidence is of a type that falls within the chapeau to section 97(1), but satisfies each of the requirements of paras (a) and (b) of section 97(1), it still cannot be tendered by the prosecution unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused. 
     
      
       
      Decision Concerning the Reasoning Below 
       
      
    37 There are two serious flaws in the way the judge’s reasoning proceeded in the present case. The first is that he treated the conclusion he arrived at, that “the proposed evidence of the Crown’s tendency does not amount to tendency” as though it were a reason for the evidence not being admissible. If evidence were truly not evidence of a tendency (and not evidence of any of the other matters referred to in the chapeau to section 97(1)) then section 97(1) would not operate on it at all. Thus, if it was relevant evidence, section 97(1) would provide no bar to its admissibility. 
     
      
    38 The second flaw is the judge’s apparent view that the tendency evidence must itself show a tendency to commit acts that are closely similar to those that constitute the crime with which a particular accused is charged. That is not so. All that a tendency need be, to fall within the chapeau to section 97(1), is “a tendency to act in a particular way”.  
     
      
    39 Of course, before any question can arise of section 97 being applicable to evidence that a person has some particular tendency, whether that person has such a tendency must itself be relevant to a fact that is in issue concerning the particular crime that is charged. This was recognised in R v Cittadini [2008] NSWCCA 256; (2008) 189 A Crim R 492, when Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed) said (at 495 [22]-[23]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Proof of a tendency to act in a particular way of itself goes nowhere. Evidence that a person had a particular tendency is adduced in order to render more probable the proposition that, on a particular occasion relevant to the proceedings, that person acted in a particular way (or had a particular state of mind); that is, to provide the foundation for an inference to that effect.  
        
       
       
        
        Put another way, tendency evidence is tendered to prove (by inference), that, because, on a particular occasion, a person acted in a particular way (or had a particular state of mind), that person, on an occasion relevant to the proceeding, acted in a particular way (or had a particular state of mind).” 
        
       
      
    40 Similarly in R v Harker [2004] NSWCCA 427 at [57], Howie J (with whom Santow JA and Bell J agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… tendency evidence is placed before the jury as evidence tending to prove the guilt of the accused. The jury are asked to reason that, because the accused acted in a particular way on some other occasion or occasions, he or she must have acted in the same way on another occasion.” 
        
       
      
    41 The case law contains examples of the way in which a tendency to engage in a particular type of behaviour can be relevant to whether an accused has committed a particular crime charged, even though that tendency does not in itself involve performance of a contravention of the same provision of the criminal law as that charged, or closely similar behaviour. In R v Li [2003] NSWCCA 407, Dunford J (with whom Spigelman CJ agreed) said at [11]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 97 is not directed only at evidence showing a tendency to commit a particular crime but showing a tendency ‘to act in a particular way’. In this case it was directed to showing that the appellant had a tendency to use violence to the complainant and to seek to control her in stressful marriage situations, and was relevant to whether he did by his actions on the night in question effectively ‘detain’ her; but it was not necessary for this purpose to show that he had detained her on any other occasion.” 
        
       
      
    42 Similarly, R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; (2005) 156 A Crim R 308 involved an appeal under section 5(1)(a) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against conviction (at 325 [75]). The appellant, who was a parish priest, had been convicted of various counts involving a variety of homosexual conduct with a boy belonging to his parish. The judge had admitted evidence of another boy who had also been the subject of the appellant’s advances. The judge had rejected evidence from other boys about the appellant’s sexual activities with them. Necessarily, given the type of appeal it was, the Crown had no capacity to allege error on the part of the judge in rejecting that evidence. However, at 324 [67], Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed) described, with apparent approval, the “tendency” sought to be illustrated by the whole of the evidence that the Crown had sought to tender on this topic was evidence that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… sought to establish a pattern of behaviour, or even a  
        modus operandi 
        , in the appellant’s behaviour. This included the use of his position as parish priest in meeting Catholic families and involving himself in their lives, developing a special relationship with the families, the children of the families, and in particular with a child the focus of his attention; and the introduction of the child to sexually explicit material and, eventually, inappropriate sexual behaviour.” 
        
       
      
    43 The same point about there being no need for the tendency to be to commit acts closely similar to those that constitute the crime charged emerges from R v Smith, in the passage quoted at para [29] above.  
     
      
    44 In my view, if the Respondent had a tendency of either the type identified by the Crown in its tendency notice, or of the type that the Crown ultimately came to rely upon in argument before Judge Sorby, that would be relevant to whether the Respondent had engaged in the acts that are the subject of the charge concerning TL. For a man to sexually interfere with a female houseguest while she is still asleep is fairly unusual. If the evidence of AG and ZM were to be accepted, that would not suffice to make out the charge concerning TL, but a jury could justifiably take the view that it increased the probability of TL’s evidence concerning the elements of the crime charged being correct.  
     
      
    45 It follows from what I have said so far that in my view, the evidence is relevant, and is evidence of a tendency to act in a particular way, within the meaning of section 97(1). It is possible for a person to have a tendency to act in a particular way even if that tendency has not shown to be manifested on very many occasions. The forensic purpose of its tender is to prove that the Respondent has a tendency to act in a particular way, namely that identified in the tendency notice or in Judge Sorby’s identification of the tendency in his judgment. Thus, the evidence falls within the chapeau of section 97(1) and will be inadmissible unless the requirements of paras (a) and (b) of section 97(1) are met, and the requirements of section 101(2) are also met. 
     
      
    46 Before proceeding further, I should give some more general consideration to the preconditions for admission of tendency evidence, and the appropriate test to apply before a decision concerning the admissibility of tendency evidence can be overturned on appeal. As mentioned earlier, there is no issue in the present case that the requirements of section 97(1)(a) have been satisfied. Even though Judge Sorby did not seek to apply either section 97(1)(b) or section 101(2) in the present case, it is relevant to consider the nature of the task involved in applying those provisions for the purpose of deciding whether this Court itself should apply them. 
     
      
       
      Section 97(1)(b) 
       
      
    47 It is the judge making the decision about admissibility of evidence who must decided whether the test in section 97(1)(b) has been satisfied. Insofar as it incorporates the phrase “significant probative value” the Act’s definition of “probative value” set out at para [24] above, is invoked.  
     
      
       
      Probative Value 
       
      
    48 Concerning that definition of “probative value”, Spigelman CJ (with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed) said in R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 at 237 [61]-[62]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, the critical word in this regard is the word  
        could  
        in the definition of probative value as set out above, namely, ‘the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment …’. The focus on  
        capability  
        draws attention to what it is  
        open 
         for the tribunal of fact to conclude. It does not direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is  
        likely  
        to conclude. Evidence has ‘probative value’, as defined, if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty.  
        
       
       
        
        This conclusion is reinforced by the test that evidence must ‘rationally affect’ the assessment. As Gaudron J emphasised in  
        Adam 
         [ 
        v The Queen  
        [2001] HCA 57; (2001) 207 CLR 96 at 115 [60]], a ‘test’ of ‘rationality’ also directs attention to capability rather than weight.” (original emphasis) 
        
       
      
    49 Thus, making a decision about the probative value of evidence does not involve a judge usurping any of the functions of a jury. Rather, it involves making a decision of law about the reasoning processes that would be open to a jury. 
     
      
       
      Significant Probative Value 
       
      
    50 The test for whether evidence not only has probative value, but also “significant probative value” was described by Lehane J in Zaknic Pty Ltd v Svelte Corporation Pty Ltd (1995) 61 FCR 171 at 175-6. His Honour said that relevance was not enough, but rather it must be shown that the evidence “could rationally effect the assessment of the probability of the relevant fact in issue to a significant extent; ie, more is required than mere statutory relevance.”  
     
      
    51 Similarly, in R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 at 459 Hunt CJ at CL noted that the terms of the definition of “probative value” are substantially similar to those of the definition of “relevance” in the Act, and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the probative value of evidence is the  
        degree 
         of its relevance to the particular fact in issue. There is no definition of  
        ‘significant’  
        probative value as that phrase is used in s 97. In its context as I have outlined it, however,  
        ‘significant’ 
         probative value must mean something more than mere relevance but something less than a  
        ‘substantial’ 
         degree of relevance … One of the primary meanings of the adjective  
        ‘significant’ 
         is  
        ‘important’ 
        , or  
        ‘of consequence’ 
        . In my opinion, that is the sense in which it is used in s 97. To some extent, it seems to me, the significance of the probative value of the tendency evidence … must depend upon the nature of the fact in issue to which it is relevant and to the significance (or importance) which that evidence may have in establishing that fact.” 
        
       
       
      Hunt CJ at CL in substance repeated that analysis in  
      R v Lock 
       (1997) 91 A Crim R 356 at 360-1. 
       
      
    52 For a judge to decide that evidence has “significant probative value” is, like the decision about whether the evidence has “probative value” at all, a decision about the reasoning processes that are open to a jury. 
     
      
    53 It has previously been observed that the generality with which a tendency is stated may be such that it provides a handicap to that evidence having “significant probative value”: Townsend v Townsend [2001] NSWCA 136 at [78] per Giles JA (with whom Hodgson JA agreed); Ibrahim v Pham [2007] NSWCA 215 at [264] per Campbell JA (with whom Hodgson and Santow JJA agreed).  
     
      
       
      Section 101(2) 
       
       
      Is Section 101(2) a Provision about Admissibility? 
       
      
    54 It has been observed that, unlike sections 135 and 137 (which are cast in terms of whether evidence is admitted) section 101(2) uses different language, namely that evidence of a particular type “adduced by the prosecution cannot be used” against the defendant unless a particular condition is met. As Simpson J pointed out in R v Fletcher at 318-19 [46]-[48] treating section 101(2) literally, as a provision that limits the use that can be made of evidence that has already been adduced, presents insuperable problems in a jury trial. It has on previous occasions been regarded as an exclusionary rule: R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; (2003) 58 NSWLR 700 at 713 [54]; R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; (2005) 227 ALR 311; 158 A Crim R 504 at [125]; R v GAC [2007] NSWCCA 315; (2007) 178 A Crim R 408 at 413 [18]. No submission has been made that we should not treat section 101(2) as an exclusionary rule of evidence. I propose to do so.  
     
      
       
      Meaning of “Prejudicial Effect” 
       
      
    55 It has also been noticed that there is a textual difference between section 101(2) on the one hand, and section 135 and 137 on the other, in that the latter sections talk of unfair prejudice, while the former talks about a “prejudicial effect”. A course of authority makes reasonably clear that this difference is not one of substance.  
     
      
    56 The unfair prejudice referred to in section 137 is not that the evidence is harmful to the interests of the accused because it tends to establish the Crown case. If that were so, then the more powerful the evidence was in showing the guilt of the accused, the greater would be the difficulty of the Crown in putting the evidence before the jury. Rather, the unfair prejudice referred to in section 137 is harm to the interests of the accused that is unfair because there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way: R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 139 per Hunt CJ at CL; Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 325 [91] per McHugh J. In R v Suteski [2002] NSWCCA 509; (2002) 56 NSWLR 182 at 199 [116], Wood CJ at CL (with whom Sully and Howie JJ agreed) said that the prejudice referred to in section 137 meant “damage to the defence case in some unacceptable way, for example by provoking some irrational, emotional or illogical response, or by giving the evidence more weight than it truly deserves”.  
     
      
    57 Other authority about the need for prejudice in section 137 to be unfair, in the sense of there being a risk of it being misused, is in R v Shamouil at 239 [72]-[73]. 
     
      
    58 The same concept, of evidence being prejudicial if it involves a risk of an unfair trial, has been adopted in relation to section 101(2). In R v RN [2005] NSWCCA 413, this Court (Sully J, with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed) adopted, as expressing the essence of the task called for by section 101(2), the statement by McHugh J in Pfennig v The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461 at 528-9: 
     
      
       
        
        “If there is a real risk that the admission of such evidence may prejudice the fair trial of the criminal charge before the court, the interests of justice require the trial judge to make a value judgment, not a mathematical calculation. The judge must compare the probative strength of the evidence with the degree of risk of an unfair trial if the evidence is admitted. Admitting the evidence will serve the interests of justice only if the judge concludes that the probative force of the evidence compared to the degree of risk of an unfair trial is such that fair minded people would think that the public interest in adducing all relevant evidence of guilt must have priority over the risk of an unfair trial.” 
        
       
      
    59 Further, there have been repeated statements in this Court to the effect that once evidence had passed section 101(2) it was not possible to think of circumstances in which it could then be rejected under section 137: R v Harker at [46]; R v Ngatikaura [2006] NSWCCA 161; (2006) 161 A Crim R 329 at 343 [71]; AE v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 52 at [41]. That would not be so if there were a difference of substance between section 101(2) and section 137.  
     
      
       
      The Balancing Task 
       
      
    60 The nature of the balancing task required to be done under section 137 is the same as the nature of the balancing task required to be done under section 101(2). R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; (2003) 58 NSWLR 700 was a decision of a five member bench of this Court, constituted to consider a conflict in previous decisions of the court concerning construction and application of section 101(2). In Pfennig v The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461 (a decision given concerning the common law, not concerning the Evidence Act), Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ had said, at 482-3: 
     
      
       
        
        “Because propensity evidence is a special class of circumstantial evidence, its probative force is to be gauged in the light of its character as such. But because it has a prejudicial capacity of a high order, the trial judge must apply the same test as a jury must apply in dealing with circumstantial evidence and ask whether there is a rational view of the evidence that is consistent with the innocence of the accused. Here ‘rational’ must be taken to mean ‘reasonable’ and the trial judge must ask himself or herself the question in the context of the prosecution case; that is to say, he or she must regard the evidence as a step in the proof of that case. Only if there is no such view can one safely conclude that the probative force of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. And, unless the tension between probative force and prejudicial effect is governed by such a principle, striking the balance will continue to resemble the exercise of a discretion rather than the application of a principle.” 
        
       
      
    61 In Ellis, Spigelman CJ (with whom Sully and O’Keefe JJ agreed) concluded, at 718 [94]-[95]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The words ‘substantially outweigh’ in a statute cannot, in my opinion, be construed to have the meaning which the majority in  
        Pfennig 
         determined was the way in which the common law balancing exercise should be conducted. The ‘no rational explanation’ test may result in a trial judge failing to give adequate consideration to the actual prejudice in the specific case which the probative value of the evidence must substantially outweigh.  
        
       
       
        
        Section 101(2) calls for a balancing exercise which can only be conducted on the facts of each case. It requires the Court to make a judgment, rather than to exercise a discretion. (See  
        R v Blick 
         (2000) 111 A Crim R 326 at 333 [20] per Sheller JA; F Bennion 
          
        ‘Distinguishing Judgment and Discretion’ 
          
        [2000]  
        Public Law 
         368.) The ‘no rational explanation’ test focuses on one only of the two matters to be balanced – by requiring a high test of probative value – thereby averting any balancing process. I am unable to construe s 101(2) to that effect.” 
        
       
      
    62 In R v Blick [2000] NSWCCA 61; (2000) 111 A Crim R 326 at 332-3 [19]-[20], Sheller JA (with whom James and Dowd JJ agreed) said of the task involved in section 137: 
     
      
       
        
        “When an application is made by a defendant pursuant to s 137 to exclude evidence, the first thing the judge must undertake is the balancing process of its probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. It is probably correct to say that the product of that process is a judgment of the sort which, in terms of appellate review, is analogous to the exercise of a judicial discretion: see the cases referred to by Priestley JA in  
        Moran v McMahon 
         [(1985) 3 NSWLR 700] at 716 and following, particularly  
        Lee Transport Co Limited v Watson 
         (1940) 64 CLR 1 at 13 and  
        Miller v Jennings 
         (1954) 92 CLR 190 at 197. In the second of those cases, Dixon CJ and Kitto J, in an appeal against damages awarded by the trial judge, said of the sum awarded that it was ‘reached after a very full and careful examination of the facts of the case and it represents an informed judgment upon a matter which must largely be one of opinion and must be governed to a not inconsiderable degree by an estimate formed of the witnesses and in particular the appellant’. Translated to the task set by s 137, a trial judge’s estimate of how the probative value should be weighed against the danger of unfair prejudice will be one of opinion based on a variety of circumstances, the evidence, the particulars of the case and the judge’s own trial experience. In that sense, the result can be described as analogous to a discretionary judgment: see Heydon,  
        A Guide to the Evidence Acts 
         (2nd ed, 1997), par 3.725.  
        
       
       
        
        Even so, and with due respect, there seems to me to be a risk of error if a judge proceeds on the basis that he or she is being asked to exercise a discretion about whether or not otherwise admissible evidence should be rejected because of unfair prejudice to the defendant. The correct approach is to perform the weighing exercise mandated. If the probative value of the evidence adduced by the prosecutor is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, there is no residual discretion. The evidence must be rejected.” 
        
       
      
    63 In R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [38], Simpson J (with whom Ipp JA and Adams J agreed) said that section 137: 
     
      
       
        
        “… is not a section that confers a discretion on the trial judge, although the balancing exercise has been said to be ‘akin’ to the exercise of a discretion. S137 calls for the exercise, not of a discretion, but of judgment. It is in that sense that it is ‘akin’ to the exercise of discretion; whilst there will be cases in which the facts are so plain that they admit of only one outcome, there will be many in which minds may properly differ. The exercise of judgment is not, in my view, akin to the exercise of discretion in the sense that, if the exercise is not performed in accordance with the section, it cannot then be undertaken by an appellate court. This Court may, in my view, consider whether the result of the balancing exercise, even if performed having regard to irrelevant considerations, was correct.” 
        
       
      
    64 The proper carrying out of the balancing task requires the judge to identify the type or types of prejudicial effect it may give rise to, and why it is that the judge has reached the view that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs (or does not substantially outweigh, as the case may be) any such prejudicial effect: R v Harker at [47], [58]; R v RN [2005] NSWCCA 413. 
     
      
       
      The Standard for Appellate Review Under Section 5F(3A) 
       
       
      The Diversity of Types of Appeals 
       
      
    65 Deciding an appeal under section 5F Criminal Appeal Act requires one to be clear about the nature of the appeal that section 5F creates. Not all appeals are of the same nature. In Dwyer v Calco Timbers Pty Ltd [2008] HCA 13; (2008) 234 CLR 124 at 128-9 [2], Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… an ‘appeal’ is not a procedure known to the common law, but, rather, always is a creature of statute. (The authorities are collected in  
        Fox v Percy 
         (2003) 214 CLR 118 at 124 [20]. In  
        Graziers Association (NSW) v Australian Legion of Ex-servicemen and Women 
         (1949) 49 SR (NSW) 300 at 303, Jordan CJ said that re-hearings under the pre- 
        Judicature Act 
         procedures of the Court of Chancery were appeals ‘in effect’.) Further, the term ‘appeal’ may be used in a number of senses. In  
        Fox v Percy 
         (2003) 214 CLR 118 at 124 [20], Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ referred to the fourfold distinction drawn by Mason J in an earlier decision ( 
        Builders Licensing Board v Sperway Constructions (Syd) Pty Ltd 
         (1976) 135 CLR 616 at 619-622) as follows:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘(i) an appeal stricto sensu, where the issue is whether the judgment below was right on the material before the trial court; (ii) an appeal by rehearing on the evidence before the trial court; (iii) an appeal by way of rehearing on that evidence supplemented by such further evidence as the appellate court admits under a statutory power to do so; and (iv) an appeal by way of a hearing de novo.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        But these categories cannot represent a closed class and particular legislative measures, such as those with which this appeal is concerned, may use the term ‘appeal’ to identify a wholly novel procedure or one which is a variant of one or more of those just described. It was in that vein that McHugh J pointed out in  
        Eastman v The Queen 
         ((2000) 203 CLR 1 at 40-41 [130]. See also  
        Turnbull v Medical Board (NSW) 
          
        [1976] 2 NSWLR 281 
         at 297-298 per Glass JA): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Which of these meanings the term ‘appeal’ has depends on the context of the term, the history of the legislation, the surrounding circumstances, and sometimes an express direction as to what the nature of the appeal is to be.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In short, it is the proper construction of the terms of any particular statutory grant of a right of appeal which determines its nature:

    66 Spigelman CJ in Perpetual Trustee Company Limited v Khoshaba [2006] NSWCA 41; (2006) 14 BPR 26,639 at [32] said, concerning the test for appellate intervention in a first instance decision: 
     
      
       
        
        “The contemporary jurisprudence of the High Court emphasises that the starting point for the determination of such issues must be a careful analysis of the text of the statute establishing the right to appeal. (See, eg

      The Type of Appeal that Arises Under Section 5F 
       
      
    68 In Norvenska v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2007] NSWCCA 158 at [11]-[13], Basten JA (with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[11] Section 5F(4) provides that an appeal under that section is to be determined on the evidence given in the proceedings to which the appeal relates, unless, by leave, fresh, additional or substituted evidence is adduced. Such provisions have, in cases involving civil jurisdiction, been relied upon in support of the conclusion that the nature of the appeal is by way of rehearing: see, eg,  
        CDJ v VAJ 
          
        (1998) 197 CLR 172 at [95]-[101] and  
        Allesch v Maunz 
          
        (2000) 203 CLR 172 at [22]. As Mr Game SC for the applicant noted, there is a suggestion in the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in  
        BWM 
          
        (1997) 91 A Crim R 260 at 265-267, that an appeal pursuant to s 5F ‘is not by way of rehearing’: at p 265. However, neither Gleeson CJ nor Hidden J joined in his Honour’s comments in that respect. Hunt CJ at CL referred (at p 267) to  
        Alexandroaia 
          
        (1995) 81 A Crim R 286 at 290, as authority that an appeal pursuant to s 5F was not by way of rehearing. However, the discussion in  
        Alexandroaia 
         at p 290 is to the effect that an exercise of discretion is only reviewable on the grounds identified in  
        House v The King  
        (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. As Gleeson CJ noted in  
        BWM 
        , 
          
        at p 261, that is not the same question. What Hunt CJ at CL appears to have meant by an appeal ‘by way of rehearing’ is to be understood by reference to his summary of the applicant’s argument in  
        BWM 
         that ‘an appeal pursuant to s 5F is by way of rehearing, and that it is for this Court to determine for itself whether the Crown should have leave to withdraw its acceptance of the plea, without first concerning itself with the issue as to whether error had been demonstrated …’: pp 264-5.  
        
       
       
        
        [12] His Honour also relied, by way of comparison with the terms of s 5F, on the express reference to a ‘rehearing’ in s 5AA(3) of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
        . That subsection was repealed by the  
        Courts Legislation Amendment Act 
          
        2000 
         (NSW), Schedule 3, [1]. The explanatory note to the amendment stated that it ‘removes the requirement that any such appeal is to be by way of a rehearing of the original evidence’. This, however, is not standard use of the terminology. As explained in  
        Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission 
          
        (2000) 203 CLR 194 at [13]-[14]:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘If an appellate tribunal can receive further evidence and its powers are not restricted to making the decision that should have been made at first instance, the appeal is usually and conveniently described as an appeal by way of rehearing. Although further evidence may be admitted on an appeal of that kind, the appeal is usually conducted by reference to the evidence given at first instance and is to be contrasted with an appeal by way of a hearing de novo. In the case of a hearing de novo, the matter is heard afresh and a decision is given on the evidence presented at that hearing. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Ordinarily, if there has been no further evidence admitted and if there has been no relevant change in the law, a court or tribunal entertaining an appeal by way of rehearing can exercise its appellate powers only if satisfied that there was error on the part of the primary decision-maker. That is because statutory provisions conferring appellate powers, even in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, are construed on the basis that, unless there is something to indicate otherwise, the power is to be exercised for the correction of error. However, the conferral of a right of appeal by way of a hearing de novo is construed as a proceeding in which the appellate body is required to exercise its powers whether or not there was error at first instance.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Accordingly, adopting the orthodox use of the terminology, an appeal pursuant to s 5F is an appeal by way of rehearing. 
        
       
       
        
        [13] Such a description of the nature of the appeal does not provide a full indication of the powers of the Court and the limitations on those powers. In an appeal under s 5F, unlike an appeal against conviction following a jury trial, this Court may have the benefit of reasons given by the trial judge, as it did in this case. On the other hand, it does not have the benefit of having seen the witnesses give evidence and respond to cross-examination, which constrains the ability of the Court to interfere with findings as to credibility.” 
        
       
      
    69 Contrary to the submission of Mr Game that Basten JA recorded, Hunt CJ at CL in BWM v The Queen (1997) 91 A Crim R 260 did more than “suggest” that an appeal pursuant to section 5F “is not by way of rehearing”. It was his considered view, supported by reasons. However, the refusal of Gleeson CJ and Hidden J to endorse that view have the effect that it is not part of the decision of the court in BWM.  
     
      
    70 The decision in Alexandroaia v The Queen (1995) 81 A Crim R 286, on which Hunt CJ at CL had relied, was a decision about the test for appellate review, under section 5F, of a judge’s refusal of an adjournment of a criminal trial – the archetype of a discretionary decision on a matter of practice and procedure that is reviewable only in accordance with House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. Thus, it is not a decision about the appellate standard for review of all decisions under section 5F. 
     
      
    71 Before Norvenska, this difference between Hunt CJ at CL on the one hand, and Gleeson CJ and Hidden J on the other, had been noted, but not resolved, by Sheller JA (with whom Grove and Kirby JJ agreed) in Giovannone v The Queen [2001] NSWCCA 22; (2001) 119 A Crim R 519 at 523-4 [14]-[16], and by Sully J (with whom Meagher JA and Dowd J agreed) in R v Glossop [2001] NSWCCA 165 at [8]-[11].  
     
      
    72 I agree with Basten JA that the right of appeal created by section 5F is an appeal by way of rehearing, in the conventional sense of appeal “by way of rehearing” explained in Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2000] HCA 47; (2000) 203 CLR 194 at 203-4 [13]-[14]. The proposition that Hunt CJ at CL was rejecting was, in substance, that the appeal under section 5F is an appeal by way of a hearing de novo.  
     
      
       
      The Need to Establish Error 
       
      
    73 Concerning an appeal by way of rehearing in the conventional sense of the term, establishing error on the part of the trial judge is necessary before the appeal succeeds: Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Hamsher (1992) 35 FCR 359 at 369 per Beaumont and Lee JJ; Williams v Minister Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 [2000] NSWCA 255; [2000] Aust Torts Reports ¶81-578 (64,136) at [60] per Heydon JA (with whom Spigelman CJ and Sheller JA agreed); Allesch v Maunz [2000] HCA 40; (2000) 203 CLR 172 at 180-181 [23]; Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833; (2001) 117 FCR 424 at 435-6 [21]-[25]; Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; (2003) 214 CLR 118 at 127-8 [27]; Jovic v Lamont [2007] NSWCA 47 at [60]; and Zoram Enterprises Pty Ltd v Zabow [2007] NSWCA 106; (2007) 71 NSWLR 354 at 379 [99]. 
     
      
       
      How the Type of Decision Appealed Against Affects Establishing Error 
       
      
    74 The “error” that the appeal court must find need not be of a single type – without trying to be exhaustive, it might be that the court below has made an order or a material finding that the appeal court is satisfied is wrong, or it might be that a process has been followed in either the trial itself or in the pre-trial preparation or in the judge’s reasoning that the law does not permit. Inevitably, it is the appellate court’s own consideration of the evidence and the reasoning in the court below that will be the basis on which it concludes that there is an error in the court below. But a real problem for appellate courts is: “how can I be confident that there is error in the court below?” Appeal court judges need to approach the task of appellate review bearing in mind the inevitable incompleteness of the reasons of the judge below in conveying all the impressions that the evidence and argument have made on the trial judge: Biogen Inc v Medeva plc [1997] RPC 1 at 45; (1996) 36 IPR 438 at 452. Appeal court judges need to approach the decision of the court below with a lively consciousness of their own fallibility and of the limitations under which they carry out their task of review (which are more extensive than concerning factual decisions influenced by demeanour: Fox v Percy at 126 [23] (quoted at para [86] below); Seiwa Australia Pty Ltd v Beard at [150]-[151]). It should also be said that for appellate judges to recognise their limitations is not inconsistent with recognising that there can also be some respects in which an appeal court has an advantage over a trial judge: Yarrabee Coal Co Pty Ltd v Lujans [2009] NSWCA 85; (2009) 53 MVR 187; [2009] Aust Torts Reports ¶82-024 (63,400) at [3]; Seiwa Australia Pty Ltd v Beard at [2].  
     
      
    75 Characteristics of the particular decision that is being appealed against affect whether an appeal court judge can be satisfied that the decision appealed from was in error. One relevant characteristic of the decision is whether it involves deciding a question concerning which the law recognises that there is no single correct answer or whether it involves deciding a question that can only be answered with a “yes” or a “no”. It is not relevant, for this purpose, that the decision is one concerning which one can say that competent lawyers could come to different conclusions. That can be said of many legal matters, including pure question of law. But questions of law, and some questions of mixed fact and law are ones that can be answered only with a “yes” or a “no”, and if the appellate court comes to be satisfied that the answer to such a question is different to that which the court below has arrived at, the appellate court must substitute the answer at which it has arrived. Another relevant characteristic concerns the type of evidentiary basis the court below was required to consider in making the decision. Another relevant characteristic concerns the process of reasoning that the court adopted in reaching its decision. See generally Costa v Public Trustee of NSW [2008] NSWCA 223; (2008) 1 ASTLR 56 at [15]–[19] per Hodgson JA, [32]–[51] per Ipp JA, cf [71]–[105] per Basten JA. 
     
      
    76 It has frequently been stated that a discretionary decision by a judge can be altered on appeal only within the principles stated in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. Those principles have been summarised by Heydon JA (Sheller JA and Studdert AJA agreeing) in Micallef v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 274. His Honour said, at [45], that a challenge to a primary judge’s discretionary decision can succeed only if the judge:  
     
      
       
        
        “(a) made an error of legal principle, 
        
       
       
        
        (b) made a material error of fact, 
        
       
       
        
        (c) took into account some irrelevant matter, 
        
       
       
        
        (d) failed to take into account, or gave insufficient weight to, some relevant matter, or 
        
       
       
        
        (e) arrived at a result so unreasonable or unjust as to suggest that one of the foregoing categories of error had occurred, even though the error in question did not explicitly appear on the face of the reasoning.” 
        
       
      
    77 In accordance with those principles, it is not enough to justify judicial intervention that the judges of the appeal court would have exercised the discretion in a different way had they been exercising the discretion at first instance: Mace v Murray (1955) 92 CLR 370 at 378. 
     
      
    78 However, the High Court has decisively rejected any suggestion that, if a decision being appealed from can be described as a discretionary decision, it follows that the appeal can be allowed only if the criteria identified in House v The King are met. In Dwyer v Calco Timbers Pty Ltd at 138-9 [37]-[40], Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The varied use of the term ‘discretion’ is apt to create a legal category of indeterminate reference. This is because the term is used in the description or characterisation of many acts or omissions in the law. It is, as Dyson LJ recently put it ( 
        Carty v Croydon London Borough Council  
        [2005] 1 WLR 2312 at 2319; [2005] 2 All ER 517 at 524. See also the observations of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Hayne JJ in  
        Coal & Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission 
         (2000) 203 CLR 194 at 204-205 [19]), ‘a somewhat protean word’ which ‘connotes the exercise of judgment in making choices’, and, in a sense, ‘most decisions involve the exercise of discretion’. 
        
       
       
        
        The term ‘discretion’ is sometimes used to describe the scope for selective choice in judicial determination of facts disputed on the evidence, particularly on the oral evidence. Thus in  
        Kades v Kades 
         (1961) 35 ALJR 251 at 253-254; 108 CLR 664 (note) Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Kitto, Taylor and Windeyer JJ, in the course of upholding the setting aside by the New South Wales Full Court of the decision of the primary judge in a custody dispute, said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘[The primary judge] saw and heard the parties as witnesses and he might thereby gauge the personality of each of them. His exercise of his discretion, moreover, should not be set aside except on firm grounds. Yet in this case the learned judge does seem to have mistaken the effect of what Mrs Kades was endeavouring to convey.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In other settings, ‘discretion’ is used quite differently. Thus, the degree to which a court of equity will interfere in the administration of trusts has been held to reflect the width of discretionary powers which have been conferred on the trustees:  
        Hartigan Nominees Pty Ltd v Rydge 
         (1992) 29 NSWLR 405 at 417, 436, 441-442. The judicial review of administrative decisions made in the exercise of a statutory power or ‘discretion’ attracts a body of principles which in this Court may conveniently be traced back to what was said by Latham CJ in  
        Shrimpton v The Commonwealth 
         (1945) 69 CLR 613 at 620. The exercise of what was called in  
        House v The King 
         (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504 ‘a judicial discretion’ to impose a particular sentence or to make a particular order under a power conferred by family provision legislation (see  
        Vigolo v Bostin 
         (2005) 221 CLR 191 at 218-219 [74]-[75]), attracts, upon subsequent exercise of a ‘general appellate power’ ((1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505), principles somewhat akin to those developed in public law. The well-known passage in  
        House v The King 
         illustrates this. 
        
       
       
        
        Rather different is the situation where statute creates a legal norm, in this litigation that of a ‘serious injury’, and does so in terms which require for their operation in a given dispute the identification and evaluation of facts and assigns that fact-finding in the first instance to a judge sitting alone. The occasion for appropriate appellate intervention will depend upon the nature and scope of the particular statutory appeal for which the legislature provides. That inquiry is not advanced by describing the overall decision-making process of the primary judge as ‘discretionary’.” 
        
       
      
    79 The “nature and scope of the particular statutory appeal” were of particular importance in Dwyer v Calco Timbers because the statute creating the appeal that was there in question required the Court of Appeal to “decide for itself whether the injury is a serious injury on the evidence and other material before the judge who heard the application and on any other evidence which the Court of Appeal may receive …” (at 134 [27]). That provision required the appeal to be approached more in the manner of an appeal de novo. There is no analogous provision in section 5F. 
     
      
    80 Conversely, there are some decisions that are not discretionary, but that nonetheless are reviewed in accordance with House v The King criteria: Singer v Berghouse (1994) 181 CLR 201 at 210-12. 
     
      
    81 In seeking to understand the way an appellate court hearing an appeal by way of rehearing approaches a decision that involves the application by a primary judge of an evaluative standard to a set of facts, it is instructive to consider the detail of the reasoning of the High Court in Warren v Coombes (1979) 142 CLR 531. The reasoning in question is that which the court employed in arriving at its conclusion about the circumstances in which an appeal court exercising an appeal by way of rehearing should overturn a trial judge’s finding concerning whether there had been a breach of duty of care. In Warren v Coombes, there was no issue about the existence of a duty of care (it will be recalled that the case involved a collision between a boy on a bicycle and a motorist), and, as the majority judgment of Gibbs ACJ, Jacobs and Murphy JJ said, at 536: “The question for decision … is whether the learned trial judge was correct in finding that the respondent was not negligent.” It was in relation to whether the trial judge was wrong in deciding there had been no breach of duty of care that their Honours said, at 551: 
     
      
       
        
        “… in general an appellate court is in as good a position as the trial judge to decide on the proper inference to be drawn from facts which are undisputed or which, having been disputed, are established by the findings of the trial judge. In deciding what is the proper inference to be drawn, the appellate court will give respect and weight to the conclusion of the trial judge, but, once having reached its own conclusion, will not shrink from giving effect to it.” 
        
       
      
    82 It was also in relation to the question of whether the trial judge was wrong in deciding that there had been no breach of duty of care that their Honours said, at 552-3: 
     
      
       
        
        “… we can see no justification for holding that an appellate court, which, after having carefully considered the judgment of the trial judge, has decided that he was wrong in drawing inferences from established facts, should nevertheless uphold his erroneous decision. To perpetuate error which has been demonstrated would seem to us a complete denial of the purpose of the appellate process. The duty of the appellate court is to decide the case – the facts as well as the law – for itself. In so doing it must recognize the advantages enjoyed by the judge who conducted the trial. But if the judges of appeal consider that in the circumstances the trial judge was in no better position to decide the particular question than they are themselves, or if, after giving full weight to his decision, they consider that it was wrong, they must discharge their duty and give effect to their own judgment. Further there is, in our opinion, no reason in logic or policy to regard the question whether the facts found do or do not give rise to the inference that a party was negligent as one which should be treated as peculiarly within the province of the trial judge. On the contrary we should have thought that the trial judge can enjoy no significant advantage in deciding such a question. The only arguments that can be advanced in favour of the view that an appellate court should defer to the decision of the trial judge on such a question are that opinions on these matters very frequently differ, and that it is in the public interest that there should be finality in litigation. The fact that judges differ often and markedly as to what would in particular circumstances be expected of a reasonable man seems to us in itself to be a reason why no narrow view should be taken of the appellate function. The resolution of these questions by courts of appeal should lead ultimately not to uncertainty but to consistency and predictability, besides being more likely to result in the attainment of justice in individual cases. The interest of the community in the speedy termination of litigation might, no doubt, be an argument in favour of the complete abolition of appeals, although that would be far too high a price to pay merely for finality. However, if the law confers a right of appeal, the appeal should be a reality, not an illusion; if the judges of an appellate court hold the decision of the trial judge to be wrong, they should correct it.  
        
       
      
    83 The way their Honours there proceeded was by considering whether, given the particular type of decision the judge below had made, the appellate court was in as good a position as the trial judge to decide that particular question for themselves. If, taking account of any advantages that the trial judge has, the appeal court is still able to reach the conclusion that the decision of the trial judge was wrong, the appeal court should overturn it. 
     
      
    84 The fact that the decision of a trial judge involves weighing and balancing various factors does not of itself mean that the appeal court is not in as good a position as the trial judge to make that particular decision, and thus to conclude that the trial judge was in error. As I pointed out in Certain Lloyds Underwriters v Giannopoulos [2009] NSWCA 56 at [105] a decision by an appellate court about whether a defendant in a negligence action has failed to act with reasonable care involves taking into account such matters as: 
     
      
       
        
        “… what choices for action were open to the defendant, was the availability of those choices for action something that the defendant knew or ought to have known, were any of those alternative methods of proceeding ones that the defendant was required by legislation to follow, what type and seriousness of injury is predictable might happen if one of those alternative courses of action is not followed, what is the extent of the risk that injury will result if one of those alternative courses of action is not followed, what disadvantages to other people might arise from the various alternative ways of proceeding, how serious are those disadvantages and what is the risk of them arising, and what were the respective costs (to the defendant and anyone else) of following those various alternative methods of proceeding.” 
        
       
      
    85 Notwithstanding that being the nature of the task, in Warren v Coombes the court held that, at least in circumstances where the facts are undisputed or have been established, an appellate court is in as good a position as the trial judge to carry out that balancing function. 
     
      
    86 One way in which characteristics of the decision appealed against affect whether an appeal court can be satisfied a trial judge’s decision was made in error is stated in Fox v Percy. Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ made clear that the obligation of an appellate court conducting an appeal by way of rehearing was to “conduct a real review of the trial and, in cases where the trial was conducted before a judge sitting alone, of that judge’s reasons” (at 126-7 [25]), and “give the judgment which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance” (at 125 [23]). However there are “natural limitations” on an appellate court that proceeds wholly or substantially on the record (125 [23]), and the appellate court’s obligation to review can only be carried out within those natural limitations (126-7 [25]). At 126 [23] of Fox v Percy, their Honours made clear that the advantage of a trial judge is by no means confined to the making of factual findings that are affected by demeanour. Deliberately not being exhaustive, their Honours said that the limitations on an appellate court: 
     
      
       
        
        “… include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses’ credibility and of the ‘feeling’ of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. Furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. Commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole.” (citations omitted) 
        
       
      
    87 The majority in Fox v Percy at 128 [28] stated that in some cases “incontrovertible facts or uncontested testimony will demonstrate that the trial judge’s conclusions are erroneous, even when they appear to be, or are stated to be, based on credibility findings”. Their Honours also acknowledged, at 128 [29], that “In some, quite rare, cases, although the facts fall short of being ‘incontrovertible’, an appellate conclusion may be reached that the decision at trial is ‘glaringly improbable’ or ‘contrary to compelling inferences’ in the case”, and be justified by those matters in reversing a trial judge’s conclusion on a matter of fact. 
     
      
    88 The inevitable advantage of a trial judge over an appellate court is one of the “natural limitations” on the ability of an appeal court to be satisfied that the trial judge has erred. In the sort of situations identified by their Honours in 128 [28] and [29], an appellate court can be satisfied that the trial judge has erred in making a factual finding that was affected by demeanour.  
     
      
    89 In Seiwa Australia Pty Ltd v Beard at [154], after reviewing this case law, I concluded, with the agreement of Allsop P and Macfarlan JA: 
     
      
       
        
        “More generally, concerning any factual finding of a trial judge that is affected by  
        any 
         of the different ways in which the trial judge has an advantage over the appellate court, there needs to be a reason, such as those identified in 128 [28] and [29] of  
        Fox v Percy 
        , that explains why it is that an appellate judge is satisfied, notwithstanding the circumstance that would usually give the trial judge an advantage, that there is error in the finding. But once an appellate judge is satisfied that there is such a reason, the obligation of the appellate judge is to correct the error.” 
        
       
      
    90 In the summary of House v The King given in Micallef, (at para [76] above) paras (a)-(d) identify circumstances in which an appellate court is able to be confident that the decision below is in error, notwithstanding that it is a decision on a topic concerning which it is clearly established that a House v The King standard of appellate evaluation is called for. An appellate court is under no disadvantage in identifying an error of legal principle, referred to in para (a). As remarked earlier, it is one of the types of decision concerning which there can be only one correct answer. The types of errors referred to in paras (b)-(d) are errors of the decision-making process, that an appellate court is not restricted in identifying. A decision reached through an error of process of these types is inevitably legally flawed. Para (e) recognises that there are some questions, concerning which a trial judge had a range of choice, in the sense that the law does not proceed on the basis that there can be only one right answer, and where no specific error can be identified, but where nonetheless the appellate court is satisfied, from the unreasonableness or injustice of the result arrived at, that the trial judge must have made an error.  
     
      
    91 The passage in House v The King at 504–5 that sets out what is often referred to as the House v The King “test” for appellate intervention is:  
     
      
       
        
        “… the judgment complained of, namely, sentence to a term of imprisonment, depends upon the exercise of a judicial discretion by the court imposing it. The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be determined is governed by established principles. It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the position of the primary judge, they would have taken a different course. It  
        must appear that some error has been made 
         in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although  
        the nature of the error may not be discoverable 
        , the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    92 The words that I have emphasised, that bookend the words that are often quoted by themselves as being the test, make clear that what their Honours were here doing was seeking to identify the circumstances in which, concerning the particular type of decision below with which they were concerned, they could be satisfied that the decision was in error. House v The King provides just one example of the way in which an appeal court must take into account characteristics of the decision being appealed against before the appeal court can be satisfied that the decision was made in error, bearing in mind the advantages that a trial judge sometimes has over an appellate court. It states a standard that is particularly applicable concerning questions to which the law recognises that there is no single right answer. A significant part of the reluctance of appellate courts to overrule a judge’s interlocutory decision on a matter of practice and procedure arises from the difficulty of the appellate court coming to know the nuances of the case as it has unfolded, and from such questions frequently being ones to which there is no single right answer. 
     
      
       
      The Standard for Appellate Review of Decisions about Tendency Evidence 
       
      
    93 There have been various cases that have made mention of the standard by reference to which an appellate court needed to be satisfied that a trial judge had lapsed into error concerning a decision about the admissibility of tendency evidence, before the appellate court could interfere with the trial judge’s decision. I should state at the outset that I have reached the conclusion that the appropriate appellate test is not the same for all of the elements involved in making a decision about whether tendency evidence is admissible. 
     
      
       
      Relevance 
       
      
    94 The first step in deciding the admissibility of tendency evidence is to decide whether or not it is relevant. Whether a particular item of evidence is relevant to a particular fact in issue is a question of law, concerning which an appellate court is in as good a position to make a decision as is the trial judge. I have already expressed the view at para [45] above that the disputed evidence in the present case is relevant. 
     
      
       
      Application of Section 97(1) 
       
      
    95 The next step involves deciding whether a particular piece of evidence is of the type that falls within the chapeau of section 97(1). That involves deciding whether the evidence in dispute has the characteristic there described (namely being evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had). That is a question that (assuming that a proper statement of the evidence proposed to be given is placed before the appellate court) an appellate court is in as good a position to answer as a trial judge. It also involves whether the evidence in dispute is tendered for the relevant purpose (namely to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind). That likewise is a question concerning which an appellate court is in as good a position to make a decision as the trial judge. I have already expressed the view, at para [45] above, that the disputed evidence in the present case falls within the chapeau of section 97(1). 
     
      
    96 While the notice requirement in section 97(1)(a) is not in dispute in the present case, I see no reason why, if it were to be in dispute, the trial judge would be in any better position than the appellate court to decide it.  
     
      
    97 There is a little more complication about the requirement of section 97(1)(b). Insofar as it may require a decision to be made about whether the evidence by itself has significant probative value, that is a matter that involves the application of a legal standard to a fact. An appellate court is in as good a position as a trial judge to decide that particular question. 
     
      
    98 Insofar as a question might arise about whether the evidence in dispute has significant probative value when taken in conjunction with other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, provided all of that other evidence was able to be placed before the appellate court there is no reason in principle why the appellate court should not be in as good a position as the trial judge to make the decision. I recognise, however, that there may be circumstances – particularly given the urgency with which appeals under section 5F(3A) Criminal Appeal Act are sometimes brought on and need to be decided – where it is not practical for the appellate court to assimilate and weigh all the relevant evidence. In such a case, if this Court had overturned a trial judge’s decision about relevance or whether evidence fell within the chapeau of section 57(1) there may be no alternative but to return the matter to the trial judge for the making of the decision about significant probative value. 
     
      
    99 In R v GAC at 422 [52], Giles JA (with whom RS Hulme and Hislop JJ agreed) said, of the jurisdictional test in section 5F(3A): 
     
      
       
        
        “Whether a decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case is at least akin to a question of present fact, to be found by this Court, and need not contemplate what might happen at a future trial.” 
        
       
       
      Whether evidence has significant probative value seems to me to be a decision of the same type. 
       
      
    100 There are some earlier statements that might create the impression that the appropriate standard for review of one of the questions needed to be decided in applying section 97(1) was the House v The King standard. In R v Fletcher at 317 [36], Simpson J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A decision to admit or reject evidence tendered under s 97(1) must, obviously, be a decision based upon the information and material available to the judge at the time the decision is made. It is a decision involving ‘a degree and value judgment’ (a phrase drawn from remarks made in the High Court in  
        Fleming v Hutchinson 
          
        (1991) 66 ALJR 211, when refusing special leave to appeal in an application which otherwise has no bearing upon the present case). Sackville J appears to have taken a similar view in  
        Jacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd 
         (2000) 106 FCR 51. Such a decision is reviewable on appeal only on the principles stated in  
        House v The King  
        (1936) 55 CLR 499; see also  
        R v Milton 
         [2004] NSWCCA 195 at [33] and  
        Jacara 
         at [75].” 
        
       
      
    101 I do not, with respect, agree that any of the decisions involved in the application of section 97(1) involve “a degree and value judgment” of any different type to that involved in, for example, a decision that a person has acted negligently (Warren v Coombes (1979) 142 CLR 531, especially at 553), a decision whether a contract is unjust (Antonovic v Volker (1986) 7 NSWLR 151 at 154-6; Beneficial Finance Corporation Ltd v Karavas (1991) 23 NSWLR 256 at 261-3, 270-1; Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Khoshaba at [107] and [110], or whether it is just and reasonable to extend a limitation period (Certain Lloyds Underwriters v Giannopoulos [2009] NSWCA 56 at [107]-[110]). Concerning all the types of decisions just mentioned, an appellate court exercising an appeal by way of rehearing substitutes its own view once it is convinced that the trial judge was in error. The question posed by section 97(1)(b) namely, whether the evidence will have significant probative value, is a question that is answered by a “yes” or “no” answer. In that respect it is not a question of degree. 
     
      
    102 Insofar as Fletcher at 317 [36] invokes Jacara at 69 [75], there Sackville J was recording a concession of the parties that the House v The King standard of appellate review applied. Insofar as the passage invokes R v Milton [2004] NSWCCA 195 at [33], there, Hidden J was talking about the standard for appellate review of decisions under section 101, not of decisions under section 97. 
     
      
    103 Another decision that might be thought to be inconsistent with the views I have expressed is my own decision in Ibrahim v Pham. In Ibrahim v Pham, I rejected (with the agreement of Hodgson and Santow JJA) an appeal against a trial judge’s rejection of evidence that had been tendered under section 97. That case involved no argument about the principles for application of section 97 (see para [259]).  
     
      
    104 There, the trial judge had rejected the application to admit the “tendency evidence” on three separate bases: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) that it did not provide any evidence of  
        ‘any relevant or material tendency’  
        at all; (2) that, if contrary to his view it was tendency evidence, it did not have the  
        ‘significant probative value’ 
         that the section requires; and (3) even if he were wrong on both of the previous grounds, he would reject it under section 135  
        Evidence Act 
        , on the basis of wasting undue time. Concerning that last ground, he noted that the action involved approximately $170,000, and that admitting the  
        ‘tendency’ 
         evidence would extend the proceedings by approximately two weeks.” (at [260]) 
        
       
      
    105 I expressly declined, at [261], to express any view concerning the first ground upon which the trial judge relied. Thus, it was not necessary to express any view about the appropriate appellate standard for overturning a decision about whether evidence is “tendency” evidence at all. I said, at [262]-[263]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Concerning the second ground, it is to be observed that the test the section imposes relates to what  
        ‘the court thinks’ 
        . The opinion that the court is required to form is one on the basis of the materials available to the judge at the time of forming his or her view. That opinion must be formed at a time when the evidence in the case is incomplete.  
        
       
       
        
        An appellate court would be able to set aside a judge’s admission or rejection of evidence under section 97  
        Evidence Act 
         if the opinion that the judge formed about whether the evidence would have significant probative value is one that, on the materials, a reasonable judge properly instructed could not have formed. However, I am not persuaded that this is such a case.” 
        
       
      
    106 While that passage does not expressly adopt the House v The King test for appellate review of whether evidence has significant probative value, it is at least consistent with a House v The King test. However, Ibrahim v Pham was not a case in which there was any issue about the standard for appellate review of a decision that evidence had “significant probative value”. A decision is not authority for a matter that has been assumed, rather than actually decided, in the course of making the decision: Baker v The Queen [1975] AC 774 at 788; Archer v Howell (1992) 7 WAR 33 at 46; Savouts v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1059 at [32]-[33]; R (Kadhim) v Brent London Borough Council Housing Benefit Review Board [2001] QB 955 at 962-3 [20]-[25], 965-6 [33]-[39]; CSR Ltd v Eddy [2005] HCA 64; (2005) 226 CLR 1 at 11 [13]; Markisic v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] NSWCA 92; (2007) 69 NSWLR 737 at 748 [56]. 
     
      
    107 The inclusion of the words “the court thinks” in section 97(1)(b) does not alter this analysis. The task of the Court under section 97(1)(b) is still to form a judgment about whether the evidence in question has “significant probative value”, and the nature of that task is not altered by the presence of the words “the court thinks”. Necessarily, any conclusion that a court comes to concerning any topic involving the application of an evaluative standard is an expression of what the court thinks. 
     
      
       
      Section 101(2) 
       
      
    108 Even though the decision under section 101(2) has been held not to be a discretion, the matters to which Sheller JA referred in R v Blick at 332-3 [19] (quoted at para [62] above) suggests that appellate review of a judge’s decision under section 101(2) should be conducted in accordance with House v The King criteria.  
     
      
    109 If, in accordance with those criteria, this Court were to decide that a judge had erred in the manner in which a decision under section 101(2) had been made, it has power, under section 5F(5)(b) Criminal Appeal Act to exercise the discretion for itself.  
     
      
    110 That the standard for appellate review of a decision under section 101(2) is the House v The King standard is consistent with the course of authority in this Court.  
     
      
    111 Concerning the standard for appellate review, in R v Milton at [33], Hidden J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whether evidence tendered as tendency evidence passes the test imposed by s 101 of the  
        Evidence Act 
         is very much a matter of judgment in the particular case. No doubt, in many cases, including the present, it is a question about which reasonable minds might differ. However, what the appellant must show is that it was not open to his Honour to have found that that test was satisfied.” 
        
       
      
    112 In AE v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 52 at [45], Bell JA, RS Hulme and Latham JJ overturned a judge’s decision that the probative value of tendency evidence substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect, but without giving any consideration to the appropriate test for appellate intervention. 
     
      
    113 R v Harker was an appeal against a trial judge’s rejection, pursuant to section 101(2), of evidence that was tendered as tendency evidence. This Court held that the judge had been mistaken in rejecting the evidence. While there was no argument about the appropriate test to apply for appellate review of such a finding, the approach adopted by Howie J at [37] was to say that the judge’s decision: 
     
      
       
        
        “… cannot be supported notwithstanding that it was in effect the exercise of a discretion and one with which this Court would not lightly interfere.” 
        
       
      
    114 At [55], Howie J identified an error of principle that the judge had made, namely that he had: 
     
      
       
        
        “… approached the matter by taking each of the allegations made by DE separately and determining whether that particular allegation had any probative value and, if it did, whether the probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. With respect that was not a proper approach in a case where the Crown was relying upon the cumulative effect of the allegations made by DE.” 
        
       
      
    115 At [56], Howie J also found that the judge had taken into account a number of irrelevant considerations. That involves applying the House v The King standard. 
     
      
    116 In R v GAC at 427-9 [70]-[78], Giles JA reviewed the state of authority on whether an appellate court should review decisions under section 97(1) or 101(2) in accordance with House v The King. He commenced, at 427 [70], by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “Neither s 97(1) nor s 101(2) expresses a discretionary decision, compare ss 135 and 136 of the  
        Evidence Act 
        . Section 97(1) states that tendency evidence is not admissible if ‘the court thinks’ that it would not have significant probative value, with the necessarily evaluative determination of what the court thinks. Section 101(2) does not refer to what the court thinks; the tendency evidence cannot be used against the defendant unless its probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. There must nonetheless be evaluation of probative value and prejudicial effect, and omission of reference to what the court thinks may not be particularly important.” 
        
       
      
    117 Ultimately it was unnecessary for his Honour to decide the question of the appropriate approach for the Court to take on appeal, because the Crown accepted that the appeal was governed by House v The King.  
     
      
       
      Returning to Application of Principle to Facts of this Case 
       
      
    118 After that discussion of principle, I return to the facts of the present case. 
     
      
    119 Judge Sorby did not consider the application of section 97(1)(b) or of section 101(2) on the facts of the present case. However, unless the statute creating the right of appeal, or the legal nature of the appeal prohibit it (a situation which does not apply in the present case) it is open to an appellate court to exercise for itself on appeal a discretion that has not been exercised in the court below. In Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27; (2009) 83 ALJR 951; 258 ALR 14, the High Court did so, as Heydon J explicitly pointed out at [130].  
     
      
    120 The terms of the creation of the right of appeal, and in particular section 5F(5)(b) Criminal Appeal Act, make clear that this Court has the power to decide the question that was before Judge Sorby, notwithstanding that he did not deal with all elements that were relevant to answering that question. However, that this Court has such a power does not necessarily mean it should be exercised. 
     
      
    121 The Respondent submits that, as the adjourned trial date is 15 February 2010, there is still ample time for the questions under sections 97(1)(b) and 101(2) to be determined by the trial judge. Given the closeness of the legal vacation, and the fact that the trial is fixed for two weeks after the start of the 2010 Law Year, I could not be confident that that is so. 
     
      
    122 Counsel for the Respondent also submits that it is possible that the evidence that each party tenders on the application will have changed closer to the trial date. While that may be a possibility, there is no ground, beyond the bare possibility, for believing it might actually happen. In any event, even if this Court were to make a ruling on the admissibility of the evidence, the status of that ruling would be the same as that of any other interlocutory ruling, and hence would be open to be revisited by a trial judge if there were to be any significant change in circumstances. I do not regard these reasons put forward by the Respondent as sufficient for this Court to decline to decide the questions under section 97(1)(b) and 101(2). 
     
      
    123 The question of whether this Court should exercise its power to decide about section 97(1)(b) and 101(2) is influenced by the present case containing a factor that is unusual. It is that the question of admissibility of the evidence now in dispute has been considered both by Judge Berman and by Judge Sorby. 
     
      
       
      Section 97(1)(b) 
       
      
    124 I have earlier concluded that, on an appeal, this Court is in as good a position as a trial judge to reach a view about whether disputed evidence has “significant probative value”. All the relevant material is before us, and I see no reason why we should not decide that question.  
     
      
    125 The Respondent accepts that the evidence in question has some probative value, but disputes that it has significant probative value. It submits that there is no striking pattern of similarity between the incidents. In my view there is no need for there to be a “striking pattern of similarity between the incidents”. All that is necessary is that the disputed evidence should make more likely, to a significant extent, the facts that make up the elements of the offence charged. In my view, it meets that test. 
     
      
    126 The Respondent submits that “the phenomenon of young women, who are drunkenly sleeping after a social event, being the subject of sexual interference is unfortunately not so compellingly rare or exceptional as to give the evidence significant probative value”. I do not accept that tendency evidence has to be of a tendency to do an act that is “compellingly rare or exceptional” before it can have significant probative value. 
     
      
    127 I am satisfied that the evidence in question has significant probative value, within the meaning of section 97(1)(b). 
     
      
    128 The Respondent’s concession that this Court has jurisdiction to hear the present appeal has as a necessary part of it a concession that the ruling appealed from “eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case” (section 5F(3A)). While I am able to reach the conclusion that the evidence in dispute in the present case satisfies the “significant probative value” test without regard to that concession, the concession supports the conclusion that the evidence in question has “significant probative value”. 
     
      
       
      Section 101(2) 
       
      
    129 There have been cases where this Court has set aside on an appeal a judge’s ruling concerning admissibility of evidence, but has declined to make a ruling about whether the evidence would fail a test that depended upon the unfairness of admitting the evidence. In R v Harker, even though the judge’s decision was set aside, this Court did not itself exercise the section 101(2) discretion. Howie J said, at [60]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not believe that the Court should indicate how the discretion arising under s 101(2) should be exercised if, and when, the matter comes back before the District Court for hearing as to the admissibility of the evidence of DE. Of course on that occasion the material before the trial judge might be different to that which was before Judge Puckeridge, particularly if DE is called to give evidence on a Basha inquiry and is cross-examined on behalf of the respondent. Further, the nature of the discretion under s 101(2) is such that reasonable minds might differ on how it should be exercised in any particular case:  
        Milton 
         at [33]. It could not be said that it is not open for a trial judge to exercise the discretion under s 101(2) to reject the evidence, provided of course that the discretion is exercised in a principled way and adequate reasons are given.” 
        
       
      
    130 In R v Smith, Blanch J took the course of not making a final decision about the application of section 101(2). He said, at [21]: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the basis of the material produced to this Court in the form of a summary of the Crown case, I would admit the evidence but that is a matter which can be left to the trial judge to determine in the light of the evidence as it emerges in the trial.” 
        
       
      
    131 R v MM [2004] NSWCCA 364 was an appeal by the Crown against a pre-trial ruling that excluded certain evidence. The charges related to various sexual acts involving the respondent’s stepdaughter. One issue concerned whether evidence of some admissions that the respondent had made to a probation and parole officer should be excluded under section 138 Evidence Act. James J (with whom McClellan AJA and Grove J agreed) held, at [51], that the judge was mistaken in holding that the evidence of the parole officer had been improperly obtained. Before the District Court judge, counsel for the respondent had submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        “… that the Probation and Parole officer’s evidence, if not excluded under s 138, should be excluded under s 90 of the  
        Evidence Act 
         (the discretion to refuse to admit evidence of admissions, if, having regard to the circumstances in which the admissions were made, it would be unfair to the accused to use the evidence) or under s 137 of the  
        Evidence Act 
         (the obligation of a court to refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecution if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused).” (at [55]) 
        
       
      
    132 At the appeal, counsel for the respondent urged the court to decide all questions concerning the admissibility of the evidence of the probation and parole officer. James J declined to do so, saying at [57]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, notwithstanding the power granted to this Court by s 5F(5)(b) of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
        , this Court should not in the present case take upon itself to decide any further questions concerning the admissibility of the evidence of the Probation and Parole officer (apart from Judge Maguire’s finding that the Probation and Parole officer’s evidence was also inadmissible as tendency evidence). The present appeal is an appeal by the Crown and par 1 of the Crown’s grounds of appeal, which relates to the evidence of the Probation and Parole officer, is limited to asserting that the judge of first instance erred in refusing to admit evidence ‘as not satisfying tests for admissibility under s 138 of the  
        Evidence Act 
         and/or constituting inadmissible tendency evidence’. More fundamentally, I consider that this Court as an appeal court should be cautious in taking upon itself to decide questions about the admissibility of evidence which have not been decided or even considered by a judge of first instance. This is particularly so, when the questions involve an exercise of discretion or the assessment and weighing of criteria such as ‘probative value’ and ‘unfair prejudice’. I note that in  
        R v 
          
        Sophear Em 
         [2003] NSWCCA 374, an appeal under s 5F(2) of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
        ,  
        this Court held that a decision by the judge of first instance excluding certain evidence had been erroneous and should be vacated but considered it inappropriate to make any further ruling of its own about the admissibility of the evidence. As stated,  
        Sophear 
          
        Em 
         was an appeal under s 5F(2) and not s 5F(3A), but the powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal conferred by ss (5) of s 5F are the same in both kinds of appeal.” 
        
       
      
    133 In R v MM, the Crown sought to tender evidence of the respondent having a practice of collecting and viewing child pornography, and evidence of admissions he had made about certain fantasies concerning sexual acts with children. The District Court judge had held that that evidence could not establish a tendency to engage in the various acts of sexual conduct with a child with which the respondent was charged. There was some unclarity about the trial judge’s reasoning process, but James J took it to be a decision that the evidence was irrelevant to the charge. James J held it was relevant, and on that basis set aside the judge’s finding that the evidence was inadmissible. James J said, at [65]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… his Honour held that the ‘tendency’ evidence was inadmissible simply on the basis of its being irrelevant and his Honour did not consider either s 97(1) or s 101(2) of the  
        Evidence Act 
         or any other provision of the  
        Evidence Act 
          
        which might be relevant. As in the case of the evidence of the Probation and Parole officer which I have already separately considered, I do not consider that this Court as an appeal court should take upon itself to decide questions of admissibility of evidence which were not decided or even considered by the judge of first instance and that, consequently, this Court should not make any decision in relation to the ‘tendency’ evidence, beyond vacating Judge Maguire’s decision, leaving it to a trial judge to determine whether the evidence or parts of it should be admitted.” 
        
       
      
    134 R v Sophear Em [2003] NSWCCA 374 to which James J referred, was a decision of this Court on appeal from a pre-trial ruling concerning whether a judge had correctly decided that evidence of an admission should be excluded under section 90 because “having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.” The decision of the judge below was set aside on the basis that he had taken into account irrelevant considerations, but this Court did not itself decide whether the use of the evidence would be unfair. Its conduct in so doing was criticised by Kirby J in his dissenting judgment on an appeal from this Court (Em v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 336) that had rejected a challenge to the eventual conviction of Mr Em: Em v The Queen [2007] HCA 46; (2007) 232 CLR 67. Kirby J said, at 117 [161]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The conventional approach to appellate review of a decision of this nature, which has miscarried for consideration of irrelevant matters, is that the appellate court will decide for itself whether, absent such matters, the decision itself was correct, or remit the discretion (or power) to be re-exercised at first instance, absent the erroneous consideration. In the present case a re-exercise of the discretion by the first Court of Criminal Appeal was to be expected, because that Court had accepted that at least three of the considerations mentioned by Shaw J were open on the evidence and relevant to the s 90 decision. But this did not occur.” 
        
       
       
      No other judge in  
      Em  
      in the High Court mentioned that topic. 
       
      
    135 The present case is unlike MM in that it is not one where a judge at first instance has not decided the question concerning applicability of section 101(2) – Judge Berman has decided it. As well, all the relevant material is before us. Concerning some evidentiary rulings made in the course of a trial there may be nuances arising from the unfolding of the evidence of the trial that an appellate court might have difficulty in recapturing, but in the present case the decision below was not made in the course of a trial. Neither when the question of the admissibility of the evidence was before Judge Berman, nor when it was before Judge Sorby, was a submission put that it was inappropriate for a decision about applicability of section 101(2) to be made until more was known about how the evidence at the trial unfolded. In those circumstances, in my view it is appropriate for this Court to form its own view about the application of section 101(2).  
     
      
    136 The Crown also relied, as a factor in favour of this Court forming its own view about section 101(2) on the protracted pre-trial proceedings that had occurred, and the need to have a decision made finally about whether the disputed evidence is admissible. I do not find it necessary to rely upon that consideration.  
     
      
    137 The Respondent points out, rightly, that section 101(2) requires more than a mere balancing of probative value with prejudicial effect – the probative value must substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect. Furthermore, section 101(2) involves taking into account the realistic possibility of how the jury might regard the evidence – the test concerns “any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant”. There is no reason to believe that Judge Berman did not appreciate these matters. Judge Berman quoted the statement of Mason P in Colby v The Queen [1999] NSWCCA 261 at [97], a passage that includes: 
     
      
       
        
        “The focus is upon the danger that the tribunal of fact will use the evidence upon a basis logically unconnected with the issues in the case …”. 
        
       
      
    138 The Respondent submits that the jury may react with revulsion to the allegation that the Respondent has sexually taken advantage of not just one young woman, but three. He submits that the jury will be tempted to punish the Respondent for global sexual criminality, rather than focusing strictly on the elements of the count in the indictment. He submits that one cannot be confident that directions will cure this sort of prejudice. 
     
      
    139 Judge Berman came to a different view. He considered he was: 
     
      
       
        
        “… able to fashion directions to a jury which will focus the jurors’ attentions on the real issues to be decided in this trial. It is the experience of the law, backed up by empirical research, that jurors do their best to follow instructions given to them by trial judges. That is not to say that jurors are immune from prejudice and emotion, but it is to say in assessing the effect of any directions to be given in this matter I should proceed on the basis that jurors will do their best to apply them.” 
        
       
      
    140 I agree with Judge Berman in this respect. Taking into account the ability (indeed, the duty) of the trial judge to give directions to the jury about how their task should be performed, I am satisfied that any prejudicial effect, of the type the Respondent identifies, can be dissipated. For that reason, the evidence passes the test in section 101(2). 
     
      
       
      Judgment on Internet? 
       
      
    141 Counsel for the Respondent submitted that, regardless of the outcome of this appeal, the judgment should not be placed on the internet until the trial had concluded. He submits that even with the use of pseudonyms there would be some potentially recognisable facts and circumstances concerning the allegation. That course was not opposed by the Crown. There was no application for any general non-publication order, just for steps to be taken to avoid the risk of the judgment being available to potential jurors and witnesses through the internet. 
     
      
    142 I would be prepared to arrange the administrative steps for this to happen, particularly given the lack of opposition by the Crown, and the comparatively short time that would be involved. However, it is important that the Court’s judgments be available to the public in general as soon as any reason for restricting their availability ceases to be applicable. To enable that to happen, I propose to direct the Solicitor for Public Prosecutions to notify the Registrar of the Court, in writing, promptly after the trial of the Respondent has concluded. The judgment can then be placed on the internet promptly after that notification is received. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    143 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (1) Vacate the ruling made by his Honour Judge Sorby on 20 October 2009. 
       
       
      (2) In lieu thereof, rule that the evidence contained in the statements of AG and ZM is admissible at the trial of the Respondent on a charge of sexual intercourse with TL without consent on 14 January 2007. 
       
       
      (3) Direct the Solicitor for Public Prosecutions to notify the Registrar of this Court, and my Associate, in writing, promptly after the trial of the Respondent has concluded. 
       
      
    144 HOWIE J: I have read the judgment of Campbell JA in draft and I agree with the orders proposed. 
     
      
    145 In my view it is unnecessary for the Court to determine the nature and extent of an appeal under s 5F in order to decide the present appeal. On any basis of appellate review the decision of Sorby DCJ that the evidence is not tendency evidence and, therefore, did not come within s 97(1)(a) of the Evidence Act must be set aside. The reasoning upon which his Honour came to that conclusion is, as the Presiding Judge makes clear, unsustainable. 
     
      
    146 Whatever be the scope of the power under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act to review a decision made by a trial judge to reject evidence under s 97, it must at least extend to permitting this Court to determine for itself whether the evidence does, or does not, disclose a tendency to which the section relates. But I am not presently persuaded that the Court can go further and undertake its own evaluation of the probative value of the evidence without regard to the decision made by the judge who determined the admissibility of the evidence. I would prefer not to determine that question in a case where the issue does not strictly arise. I am content to allow the appeal on the basis that Sorby DCJ was clearly in error in the only finding that he made for the reasons given by the Presiding Judge. 
     
      
    147 The history of this matter in the District Court, as set out by the Presiding Judge, is a troubling one. There has been unacceptable delay in the determination of the allegation made by TL and confusion as to the status of any ruling that Judge Sorby made concerning the evidence that the Crown could lead in that trial. The problems have arisen principally from the failure of Judge Sorby in September 2008 to pronounce unambiguously the rulings he had made and the reasons for making them. Apparently not even the parties that were before him knew precisely what his Honour had determined. The same defence counsel who appeared before Judge Sorby in 2008 also appeared before Judge Berman and yet he was of the opinion that Judge Sorby had not decided the admissibility of the evidence of AG and ZM on the trial relating to TL. 
     
      
    148 Even if it is accepted that in September 2008 Judge Sorby was being asked to determine the admissibility of the evidence now under consideration on what was ostensibly a separate trial application, his Honour should, in my opinion, have declined to make that ruling once he had determined the separate trial application and was intending to proceed with the trial involving the allegations against AG and ZM. There was no purpose in his making the further ruling on the admissibility of evidence in the trial involving TL when he was not going to be the trial judge. Yet by making that decision he was in effect binding the trial judge by reason of s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act. Because it has been assumed in the District Court that the section applies to evidentiary rulings, it was essential that Judge Sorby made clear what his rulings were and his reasons for making those rulings as a result of the hearing before him in September 2008. But even without the section, his Honour was duty bound to formally announce his rulings and to give his reasons for them. 
     
      
    149 What is clear from the history of these proceedings is that the trial judge in sexual assault proceedings to which s 130A applies will not necessarily be making decisions which are quintessentially those to be made by a trial judge. In my opinion the trial judge is the appropriate person to determine any question as to the admissibility of evidence and this Court has always taken that view by remitting issues of admissibility to the trial judge after a ruling under s 5F. In particular, I have difficulty in understanding how any judge but the trial judge can make decisions which involve the exercise of a discretionary judgment such as is found in s 137 and s 101(2) of the Evidence Act. It is the trial judge who is in the best position to determine whether directions or warnings to a jury, which the trial judge will be required to fashion, can reduce any unfair prejudice arising from the admission of the evidence. In R v Harker [2004] NSWCCA 427 at [47] it was made clear that a judge could not reject evidence under s 137 without considering whether warnings or directions to the jury could overcome the prejudice accompanying the admission of the evidence. 
     
      
    150 However it is open to question whether s 130A has anything to do with evidentiary rulings. The section is concerned with pre-trial orders in sexual assault proceedings. The proceedings before Judge Sorby in September 2008 fell within the scope of the section at least so far as the order for separate trials was concerned. That section relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) A pre-trial order made by a Judge in sexual offence proceedings is binding on the trial Judge in those proceedings unless, in the opinion of the trial Judge, it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding. 
        
       
       
        
        ………… 
        
       
       
        
        (4) For the purposes of this section:  
         
        “ 
        pre-trial order 
        ” means any order made after the indictment is first presented but before the empanelment of a jury for a trial. 
         
        “ 
        sexual offence proceedings 
        ” means proceedings on indictment in respect of a prescribed sexual offence. 
         
        “ 
        trial Judge 
        ” means the Judge before whom the trial proceedings, following empanelment of a jury, are heard. 
        
       
      
    151 There have been decisions of this Court holding that the term “interlocutory judgment or order” in s 5F does not include an evidentiary ruling, see for example R v Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136. I have difficulty in seeing how an evidentiary ruling can fall within the scope of a “pre-trial order” under s 130A. A decision to admit or reject evidence produces no order. 
     
      
    152 However, it is clear from the Second Reading Speech introducing the bill that amended the Criminal Procedure Act by inserting the provision that it was intended that it would apply to evidentiary rulings. The speech contains the following: 
     
      
       
        
        Rulings on the admissibility of evidence by a judge other than the trial judge are not currently binding and it is not possible to ensure that the same judge will deal with both the pre-trial hearing and the trial. Therefore, in order for rulings made by one judge to be binding on a subsequent trial judge, there must be legislative amendment: 
          
        Hansard NSW Parliament, Legislative Assembly 16 November 2005 at 19870. 
        
       
       
      But  
      Harrison v Melham 
       [2008] NSWCA 67; 72 NSWLR 380 has addressed the use to be made of minister’s speeches when interpreting statutory provisions, see per Spigelman CJ at [12] and following and Mason P at [159] and following. This may be a case where Parliament “has missed its intended target”, see Mason P at [161]. 
       
      
    153 However, this was not a matter that was ventilated on the hearing of the appeal and the parties proceeded on the basis that the section did operate. It was under this section that Judge Sorby purported to make the ruling that he did in October 2009. He used the section in effect to overturn the ruling that Judge Berman had made. It was not suggested before us that the earlier rulings made by Judge Sorby in September 2008, whatever they were, continued to apply. If s 130A applied and Judge Sorby had in fact made a ruling on the admissibility of the evidence being considered by Judge Berman, then arguably Judge Berman had no jurisdiction to make the ruling that he made without deciding whether it was in the interests of justice that he not be bound by the earlier ruling of Judge Sorby. The concession made by the parties before Judge Berman that Judge Sorby had not made any such ruling would not have conferred jurisdiction on Judge Berman to make the ruling contrary to s 130A if in fact a ruling had been made. 
     
      
    154 It should be taken that Judge Sorby by redetermining the issue in the judgment from which the present appeal arises had in effect vacated his earlier ruling and dealt with the question afresh. We are now determining the correctness of that ruling despite the history of the matter and the confusion that has arisen because of the failure of Judge Sorby to articulate the rulings he made in September 2008 or the reasons for making them. 
     
      
    155 But it is this history of the matter and the effect that s 130A has so far had on the rulings on admissibility of the evidence now under consideration that has convinced me that in the very exceptional circumstances of this case the Court should end the confusion and debate that has so far dogged this trial and declare that the evidence is admissible for the reasons given by Judge Berman. His Honour was the trial Judge when he made the ruling and his ruling was frustrated by the respondent withdrawing instructions from his counsel. On the material before this Court there is no error in the approach taken by Judge Berman for the reasons he gave. The trial is listed in February. On the present state of affairs, if this Court were simply to remit the matter to the trial judge, as is the usual practice, that judge would not know what ruling, if any, was binding under s 130A. If circumstances change and it appears to the trial judge that he or she should reconsider the ruling, the judge is entitled to do so. 
     
      
    156 ROTHMAN J: I too have read the draft reasons for judgment of Campbell JA. I agree with the orders his Honour proposes.  
     
      
    157 I have read, also, the reasons in draft of Howie J. I agree with Howie J that in the current judgment, it is unnecessary to determine the nature, extent or test for an appeal under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
     
      
    158 Whether House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 applies to s 5F appeals is irrelevant to the outcome of this appeal and was not the subject of substantial argument by counsel. On any test, the outcome below is manifestly unavailable.  
     
      
    159 As to the question of whether a ruling on evidence is an order for the purpose of s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, again it is unnecessary to determine the issue in this appeal, but, as to whether such a ruling is an “order” for the purpose of s 5F, I rely on my reasons (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Buddin J agreed) in Kocer v R [2006] NSWCCA 328 at [11]-[19]. As is clear from those reasons, the term in a different context may have a very different meaning.  
     
      
    160 For the reasons given by Howie J at [155], I agree that the Court should make order 2 of the proposed orders.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: On 13 February 2009 the appellant, Catherine Anne Beatson was convicted by a jury of the offence that on 16 June 2007 at Chippendale she did have in her possession for supply not less than the commercial quantity of 1,3 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (commonly known as ecstasy). The appellant’s co-offender, Andrew Craig Byrne, was jointly tried with her and convicted of the same offence. The appellant now seeks to appeal against her conviction upon the following grounds, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground One  
         - The verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground Two  
        – His Honour erred by failing to direct the jury to acquit the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground Three 
         – His Honour erred by refusing to admit evidence from Yasmin Savage that Andrew Byrne had previously asked her if she wanted some pills. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground Four 
         – His Honour erred by failing to order that the appellant be tried separately from Andrew Byrne. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground Five  
        – The trial miscarried because the Crown Prosecutor submitted to the jury that defence counsel had raised irrelevant issues to divert the jury from considering the true facts, that the appellant and Mr Byrne had knowledge of the drugs in the vehicle. 
        
       
      
    2 For reasons that will become apparent, it is only necessary to deal with Ground 1, namely, the verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence at trial. 
     
      
    3 The relevant test applicable to this ground is that articulated by McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at 623 [56] in the following terms (omitting footnotes): 
     
      
       
        
        “The majority in  
        M  
        pointed out that ‘[i]n most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced’. In such a case of doubt, it is only where the jury’s advantage of seeing and hearing the evidence can explain the difference in conclusion about the accused’s guilt that the appellate court may decide that no miscarriage of justice has occurred: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a  
          significant possibility  
          that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.’ ” (Emphasis in original). 
          
         
        
       
       
      These principles have been repeated in numerous cases, one of the latest being that of this Court in  
      Rasic v Regina  
      [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [25] and [26].  
       
      
    4 As both the appellant and the Crown acknowledged, the key issue with respect to the charge against the appellant was whether the Crown could establish beyond reasonable doubt the element of possession. No complaint is made with respect to the relevant part of the summing up of the trial judge in which he correctly identified the obligation of the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that each of the accused intentionally had the relevant drugs in their physical custody or control to the exclusion of all others except themselves. 
     
      
    5 The case against the appellant was entirely circumstantial whereas that against her co-accused was only partly so. The relevant drugs were found in a vehicle which had been hired by the co-accused on 15 June 2007. The relevant facts are as follows. 
     
      
    6 On 16 June 2007 at approximately 6pm police officers attended Rose Street, Chippendale after a report that a blue Commodore had been in a collision. They found the appellant in the front passenger seat and her co-accused in the driver’s seat. Both appeared to be asleep.  
     
      
    7 A search of the vehicle both on that occasion and on the following day, 17 June, revealed a number of items including a packet of Horizon cigarettes within which was a small resealable bag containing 0.29gms of ecstasy; a large bag on the floor behind the driver’s seat containing 102.1gms of ecstasy and a large bag underneath the driver’s seat which contained 107.3gms of the drug. No fingerprints or DNA were found on the first of the bags, but the co-accused’s DNA was found on the second bag. Also found in the boot of the vehicle was three 4 litre cans of acetone which can be used as a cutting agent for amphetamines. Although a fingerprint was found on one of the cans it did not match either of the accused. Nonetheless, a black motorcycle jacket belonging to the co-accused was found in the boot. 
     
      
    8 In the rear footwell behind the front passenger seat was found a blue/black backpack containing paraphernalia capable of being used for drug use or supply. On the floor behind the front passenger seat, a green shopping bag contained similar paraphernalia was found. 
     
      
    9 At the time the police officers approached the appellant’s co-accused, he reached behind the front passenger seat and attempted to take something from the green shopping bag, which he was prevented from doing by a police officer. He was breath tested for alcohol and returned a negative result. However, a blood test was later conducted upon the co-accused in hospital which revealed ecstasy and a mixture of other drugs present in his blood. No such test was conducted with respect to the appellant. 
     
      
    10 It was common ground that the vehicle had been involved in a minor accident. At the time the police arrived both the co-accused and the appellant were apparently asleep. According to Leading Senior Constable Wynne (at T 108), the appellant was slumped over the dashboard and appeared to be asleep. The appellant was removed from the vehicle and taken across the road. At T177-178 LSC Wynne agreed that the highest he was able to say was that she was or appeared to be intoxicated or affected by something, but he was unable to identify that something. 
     
      
    11 As I have indicated, the appellant was not tested for drugs: nor was she breathalysed. 
     
      
    12 Relatively little evidence was led by the Crown in connection with the appellant. Most of the evidence of the Crown witnesses was directed to the co-accused as was their cross-examination. I have carefully read that part of the evidence relating to the appellant and what follows is the essential parts of that evidence. 
     
      
    13 The only evidentiary connection which could possibly be so described between the appellant and the drugs related to a sewing kit or white plastic container which held a large number of resealable plastic bags which, according to LSC Wynne, were used in the drug trade: see T114. 
     
      
    14 However, the evidence with respect to the so-called sewing kit was somewhat ambiguous. Evidence with respect to this issue was given both by Senior Constable Bushell and Constable Quinn. The evidence of the former (at T193-194) was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you see the accused, Miss Beatson, walk back to the vehicle, sit in the front passenger seat and take some ID out of a wallet? 
         
        A. Yes, I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. About that time did you see her drop the wallet and a plastic sewing kit into the gutter between her feet? 
         
        A. Yes, I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you then see Miss Beatson get up and walk back over to where Constable Quinn was standing? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you then walk over to where the wallet and sewing kit were in the gutter, did you pick them up and put them on the front passenger seat of the vehicle? 
         
        A. Yes, I did.” 
        
       
      
    15 A slightly different version was given by Constable Quinn (at T229) in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you ask Ms Beatson if she had any identification on her? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. She said it was in the vehicle? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was she taken back to the vehicle and did she sit in the front passenger side of the vehicle and did she start to get her identification out of her bag? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q As you watched her did you see her fiddle around for a whitle and did you notice that she knocked a clear white plastic container out of the vehicle as she was getting her identification? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you take the identification from her and then walk her back to the wall and did she then sit down? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    16 It will be apparent from the foregoing extracts from the evidence that on one version, when extracting her ID from her wallet the appellant not only dropped her wallet but also a plastic sewing kit into the gutter between her feet whereas on the other version it was while she was fiddling around in an attempt to extract her ID from her wallet that she knocked a clear white plastic container out of the vehicle into the gutter.  
     
      
    17 How precisely the sewing kit/container came to be dropped or not, intentionally or otherwise, by the appellant was left up in the air. 
     
      
    18 The appellant was placed under arrest for being in possession of a prohibited drug. The following exchange took place between her and Constable Quinn relevant to this issue: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did Senior Constable Bushell come over to the caged truck and say, ‘Catherine, do you understand why you are under arrest?’ and did Ms Beatson reply ‘No’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did Constable Bushell say ‘For the possession of a prohibited drug, you do not have to say or do anything if you do not want to, do you under stand that?’. 
         
        A. yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did Ms Beatson reply ‘Yeah, but I didn’t have any drugs on me’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did Constable Bushell say ‘Anything you say or do I will record and I may use this recording in court, do you understand that?’ 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did Ms Beatson reply ‘Yeah, but I didn’t have any drugs on me’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
    19 The appellant’s foregoing response when cautioned was, to say the least, ambiguous. I accept that it was not a direct denial of any knowledge of the drugs in the vehicle, but being ambiguous it was hardly a firm foundation, whether taken alone or in conjunction with the other evidence, for a finding beyond reasonable doubt that she was intentionally in possession of 209gms of ecstasy for the purpose of supply. In any event, it could legitimately be said that the appellant’s reply to Constable Bushell was indeed responsive to his informing her that she was under arrest for “the possession of a prohibited drug”. In other words, the appellant could be forgiven for understanding that she was being charged with the possession of drugs on her person. This would explain her response. 
     
      
    20 In its written submissions the Crown accepted that the overwhelming weight of evidence inculpated the appellant’s co-accused rather than the appellant. It submitted that a scenario could not have rationally developed whereby the co-accused was acquitted and the appellant alone convicted. On the other hand in my view a scenario could have rationally developed whereby the co-accused was convicted and the appellant acquitted. There would have been nothing irrational about that. 
     
      
    21 The Crown also accepted that in the case against the co-accused there was direct evidence that physically connected him to the prohibited drugs. The exercise of comparing the respective cases of the two accused was capable of illustrating the relative strengths of those cases namely, and I interpolate this, that one was strong and the other was not. It was acknowledged that to an advocate, the relative strengths of the case against the appellant’s co-accused as distinct of that against the appellant herself provided a forensic means to persuade the jury to use the comparison as itself a reason why the Crown case against the appellant should be rejected as insufficient. I agree and such a case was made to the jury and ought, in my view, to have been sufficiently persuasive to at least have raised a reasonable doubt as to her guilt. 
     
      
    22 The Crown nevertheless submitted that the motor vehicle itself was a travelling store of prohibited drugs for sale. As both the appellant and her co-accused were discovered asleep in the vehicle, the clear available inference was that they were both intoxicated by drugs. This was certainly the case in relation to the co-accused – there was no direct evidence in support of that proposition in the case of the appellant, although it may have been an available inference. 
     
      
    23 The Crown also submitted that the appellant’s shared interest in drugs with her co-accused implied, at the very least, comity with him insofar as the illicit possession and purchase of prohibited drugs was concerned. Drawing the necessary inferences, the circumstances favoured the hypothesis that the appellant was acting jointly with her co-accused rather than simply being his passenger, or indeed his customer. They remained in company with each other after the consumption of drugs.  
     
      
    24 I do not accept this last submission as being the only hypothesis that was open to the jury to find. In my view a position to the contrary was an equally open hypothesis. At the very least, a hypothesis of equal strength was that the appellant was in the company of her co-accused simply because she was indeed his passenger and may have been his customer and he her supplier. The factors relied upon by the Crown could not, in my view, have led the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only hypothesis open was that the appellant was in possession of the drugs in the relevant legal sense.  
     
      
    25 As I have observed above, the Crown recognised that the essential issue for the jury’s determination was whether the appellant could properly be found beyond reasonable doubt to have intentionally exercised physical custody and control, in a joint sense, over the prohibited substance found in the vehicle. It was submitted that it was open to the jury to draw inferences from the circumstances in which the appellant and her co-accused were located in the vehicle and the nature of their discovery and apparent association at that time to find that she was in a position whereby she could exercise dominion over the items in the car to the exclusion of anyone except herself and her co-accused.  
     
      
    26 It was submitted that it was open to the jury to reason from the evidence that the appellant’s direct proximity to the paraphernalia contained in the car (including that in the boot of the car) when considered in combination with the other items found therein, operated to support the proposition of joint possession of the drugs which were destined to be repackaged and supplied.  
     
      
    27 In my view the Crown’s contentions should be rejected. The circumstances proved by the Crown did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference to be drawn from the evidence by the jury was that the appellant was, to her knowledge, in possession of the drugs in that she intentionally exercised custody or control over them to the exclusion of all others except herself and her co-accused for the purpose of their supply. 
     
      
    28 As I have said, an equally rational inference to that contended for by the Crown was that the appellant was no more than a user of drugs and that she had used some of the drug on this occasion: in other words, although she may have used the drug with the concurrence of her co-accused, her relationship to the drugs was no more than a recipient of them from her co-accused as her supplier. At least that was a hypothesis equally open to the jury and thus one consistent with her innocence of the offence with which she was charged. 
     
      
    29 The difficulty faced by the Crown is that there was no evidence as to first, how or when or for how long the appellant came to be in the subject vehicle or as to the nature of her relationship, such as it might be, with her co-accused; second, whether she was party to the placing of the drugs and the other paraphernalia in the vehicle; third, whether she was involved in their purchase or acquisition; fourth, whether she knew that the drugs and other paraphernalia were even in the vehicle; and fifth, whether she in fact was intoxicated as a consequence of using drugs prior to her arrest. 
     
      
    30 In contrast, as the appellant submitted, the evidence with respect to the appellant’s co-accused was that first, he had arranged for the hire of the vehicle; second, that he was slumped forward over the steering wheel in the driver’s seat; third, that he tested positive for drugs in a blood test; fourth, that he attempted to reach for the green shopping bag which contained drug type paraphernalia; fifth, that he was in close proximity to the Horizon cigarette packet that contained drugs; sixth, that the black leather jacket belonging to him was found in the boot in which there was also three 4 litre cans of acetone; seventh, and most importantly, the co-accused’s DNA was found on the second bag of drugs found on 17 June. 
     
      
    31 Furthermore, there was no evidence that the appellant had ever had anything to do with the green shopping bag; that she had anything to do with the blue and black backpack which contained prescriptions issued by a Dr Sheridan in the name of the co-accused as well as motorcycle gloves which could be clearly linked to his motorcycle jacket found in the boot of the vehicle which contained the three 4 litre cans of acetone. In fact the only evidence of any real probative value which may have linked the appellant to the contents of the vehicle was the sewing kit, but there was nothing to suggest that the appellant had anything to do with this item which fell into the gutter outside the vehicle as the appellant attempted to obtain her ID card from her wallet. 
     
      
    32 At the end of the day the only connection between the appellant and the vehicle was the fact that she was in the front passenger seat at the time that the police arrived on the scene. She was unconnected with the hiring and driving of the vehicle by her co-accused and, as I have indicated, there is nothing to establish when, for what purpose and for how long she had been in the vehicle. 
     
      
    33 It is thus apparent that the Crown’s case was based on no more than the contents of the vehicle and the fact that the appellant was found in it with the ambiguous evidence of the sewing kit. In my view the evidence led against the appellant not only displayed inadequacies but also lacked probative force and gave rise to a significant possibility that an innocent person had been convicted. Critically, in my view, a jury could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference from the evidence was that the appellant was in possession of the drugs found in the vehicle for the purpose of supply in that she intentionally exercised custody or control over them to the exclusion of all others except her co-accused. I would experience such a doubt and, therefore, so ought have the jury. 
     
      
    34 I repeat that in my view, an equally rational inference open on the evidence was that the appellant was an innocent passenger in the vehicle. Even if her intoxication had been due to the ingestion of drugs, there was no evidence that would necessarily support an inference that it was the drugs in the vehicle she had ingested. But even if that was an available inference, it did not follow that a jury could find beyond reasonable doubt that she was in possession of the totality of the drugs the subject of the charge for the purpose of supply. 
     
      
    35 For the foregoing reasons in my opinion Ground 1 has been established with the consequence that it is unnecessary to consider the other grounds of appeal relied upon. The appeal should be allowed, the appellant’s conviction should be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered. 
     
      
    36 HIDDEN J: I agree with Tobias JA. 
     
      
    37 HOWIE J: I agree with Tobias JA.

      2005/3786 Regina v Ram Puneet Tiwary 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: On 6 October 2009, the Offender, Ram Puneet Tiwary, was found guilty by a jury on two counts of murder committed on 15 September 2003. The Offender was convicted of the murders of his flatmates, Chow Lyang Tay and Poh Chuan Tan.  
     
      
    2 The Offender had been convicted of the murders on 20 June 2006 following an earlier trial before Adams J and a jury. On 6 November 2006, Adams J sentenced the Offender to a term of imprisonment for 25 years for the murder of Mr Tay and to life imprisonment for the murder of Mr Tan: R v Tiwary [2006] NSWSC 1156. On 17 December 2008, the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld an appeal against conviction, quashed the sentences and ordered a new trial: Tiwary v R [2008] NSWCCA 319. That trial commenced on 31 August 2009, culminating in the conviction of the Offender by the jury on both counts of murder on 6 October 2009.  
     
      
    3 On 13 November 2009, I heard submissions with respect to sentence. The Crown furnished written submissions and made additional oral submissions in response to a number of questions from the Court. Mr Dalton SC, who appeared for the Offender at trial and on sentence, informed the Court of his instructions not to make any submissions on sentence, beyond the Offender’s acceptance that the sentences imposed by Adams J were appropriate for the person who murdered Mr Tay and Mr Tan. At all times, the Offender has maintained that he did not kill either man. 
     
      
       
      Findings of Fact 
       
      
    4 It falls to me as the trial Judge to determine punishment and, for that purpose, to make findings of fact relevant to sentencing. The primary constraint is that the view of the facts adopted by me for the purpose of sentencing must be consistent with the verdicts of the jury. Any findings of fact against the Offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: Cheung v The Queen [2001] 209 CLR 1 at 12-13 [14]. The Offender does not seek to rely upon any matter in mitigation of penalty. However, if there were matters which were capable of mitigating penalty, it is sufficient if those matters are proved on the balance of probabilities: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] 199 CLR 270 at 281 [27]-[28].  
     
      
    5 The following findings of fact are based upon evidence adduced at the trial. The Offender did not give evidence at the trial, nor in the sentencing proceedings. However, the Offender gave several lengthy recorded interviews to police in 2003 and 2004, which formed part of the evidence before the jury at the trial.  
     
      
       
      The Victims and the Offender 
       
      
    6 Mr Tay was born in 1977 and was 26 years of age at the time of his death. Mr Tan was born in 1976 and was also 26 years of age when he died. 
     
      
    7 The Offender was born in 1979 and was 24 years of age as at 15 September 2003.  
     
      
    8 The murders occurred in a rented top-floor duplex apartment occupied by Mr Tay, Mr Tan and the Offender at 2/109 Barker Street, Kingsford. Mr Tay had lived in those premises since July 2002. From March 2003, Mr Tay, Mr Tan and the Offender were living together in the premises. The apartment had four bedrooms, a bathroom, a living room and kitchen. It had separate entrances by way of stairways leading to the front door and the back door.  
     
      
    9 Mr Tay, Mr Tan and the Offender were all citizens of the Republic of Singapore. As at September 2003, each was enrolled at the University of New South Wales, with Mr Tay and Mr Tan studying electrical engineering and the Offender studying mechanical engineering.  
     
      
    10 Mr Tan and Mr Tay were due to graduate and complete their degrees at the end of 2003. Each had impressive academic records. Mr Tay was posthumously awarded a degree with second-class honours (Division 2) and Mr Tan was awarded a posthumous degree with first-class honours. 
     
      
    11 The Offender had enrolled at the University of New South Wales in 2000. He had a chequered academic record and did not enrol at the University for the first semester of 2003.  
     
      
    12 Mr Tan and the Offender attended the University on scholarships from the Singapore Armed Services. Mr Tay was privately funded in his studies.  
     
      
    13 The Offender had entered into an agreement with the Singapore Armed Forces whereby he was to pursue his studies diligently and satisfactorily. If he failed in fulfilling the agreement, he and his sureties could be called on to repay monies expended on and advanced to the Offender in regard to his University studies. On 10 June 2002, the Offender reported false examination results to the Singapore Armed Forces so that he could continue his studies financed by the military scholarship. He reported that he had passed all five subjects in semester two of 2001, when he had in fact passed two subjects and failed three. 
     
      
    14 Mr Tay was a quiet and studious person with no known connections to the underworld or criminal element. There was no evidence of any ill will or animosity between him and the Offender prior to 15 September 2003. Likewise, Mr Tan was a quiet and studious person with no known connections in the underworld or criminal element and there was no evidence of any ill will prior to 15 September 2003 between him and the Offender, nor between him and Mr Tay. 
     
      
    15 According to the evidence, Mr Tay and Mr Tan had no known enemies. Both were married men whose wives resided in Singapore. There was no evidence of any marital misbehaviour on the part of Mr Tan. Evidence was adduced at the trial indicating that Mr Tay was involved in what the Crown described, accurately, as a “long distance flirtation” with Jasmine Tan, a friend in Singapore. There was no evidence of any direct contact between them, other than a series of ICQ messages which were before the jury. Immigration searches revealed that Jasmine Tan and her then boyfriend (and present husband) were not in Australia in 2003 (Exhibits BK and BL).  
     
      
    16 Mr Tay was to graduate at the end of 2003. He was anxious to transfer the lease on the Barker Street apartment, and the responsibility for the payment of rent, to the Offender. Prior to 13 September 2003, Mr Tay had discussed with the Offender the prospect that the latter would become responsible for the collection of the rent and the payments of the rental monies. As at August 2003, the Offender owed Mr Tay $5,054.00 for arrears of rent and incidental expenses. The Offender had liaised with Mr Tay for a person named “Andrew” to become the fourth tenant of the apartment, and for “Andrew” to be responsible for a quarter share of the rent from July 2003 onwards. The Crown submitted at trial, and I accept, that the person “Andrew” did not exist and was a ruse of the Offender to have a fourth share of the rent allocated to a person unknown to Mr Tay, in order to reduce the amount of rent to be paid by the Offender to Mr Tay each month. The evidence revealed that “Andrew” owed Mr Tay $1,590.00 as rent for two months, bond money and incidental expenses.  
     
      
    17 On 15 August 2003, the Offender was sent an invoice from the University requiring immediate payment of fees in the sum of $7,271.00. The fees were not paid.  
     
      
    18 The only motive advanced by the Crown for the Offender to murder Mr Tay was the debt owed by the Offender with respect to the apartment, by reference to his own outstanding rent and the money payable by “Andrew”. In addition, the Crown contended that there was increasing pressure upon the Offender as the end of 2003 drew near, given his agreement to take over from Mr Tay as the tenant of the apartment. Finally, the Crown pointed to the financial demand made by the University of the Offender for fees, all of which the Crown contended constituted a significant cumulative financial pressure upon the Offender, and a source of grievance between Mr Tay and the Offender. 
     
      
       
      Events Leading Up to 15 September 2003 
       
      
    19 On Saturday, 13 September 2003, the Offender purchased a softball bat from the Rebel Sports Store in Sydney. He took the softball bat to the apartment, where it remained until its use in the murder of Mr Tay and Mr Tan two days later. The Crown did not contend that the purchase of the softball bat by the Offender on 13 September 2003 evidenced a plan to use it as a weapon, let alone to kill, at that time. 
     
      
    20 In September 2003, the Offender was working part time as a security guard and he worked in this capacity at times on 13 and 14 September 2003. The Offender returned to the apartment at about 6.00 pm on Sunday, 14 September 2003 and watched television with Mr Tay and Mr Tan. The Offender went to bed and did not wake until about 6.30 am on Monday, 15 September 2003.  
     
      
    21 The Offender’s then girlfriend, Elvira Metiljevic, gave evidence at the trial. At about 6.30 am on Monday, 15 September 2003, she rang the Offender and they spoke for about half an hour, arranging to meet that afternoon at the University at 2.00 pm. In his interviews with police, the Offender said that following this phone call, he showered, had breakfast and went back to bed. The Offender said that, at about 8.00 am, he heard what he thought was the television playing, but did not get out of bed at that time and went back to sleep. It was the Offender’s account that the next noises he heard were the noises surrounding the killing of Mr Tan at about 2.10 pm. Clearly, the jury rejected the Offender’s account given in recorded interviews. 
     
      
    22 Mr Tay’s computer, located on the desk in his bedroom, was switched off manually at 10.16 am on 15 September 2003.  
     
      
    23 Mr Tan’s computer, located in his bedroom, was last used at 12.02 pm on 15 September 2003 and was manually shut down immediately after that use. Before then, Mr Tan had sent emails at 10.42 am and 11.06 am to his thesis supervisor, Professor Ambikairajah. I accept that Mr Tan was immersed, at that time, in preparation of his thesis.  
     
      
    24 It was the case that Mr Tan and Mr Tay, who were reasonably close friends, would usually attend University classes together. On 15 September 2003, however, Mr Tan left the Barker Street apartment shortly after midday to attend a lecture at the University of New South Wales which was nearby. Mr Tay remained at the apartment.  
     
      
       
      The Murder of Mr Tay 
       
      
    25 Consistent with the jury’s verdict, I find that the Offender attacked Mr Tay with the softball bat in the lounge room of the apartment soon after midday on 15 September 2003. This time can be determined in the following way. As will be seen, it is reasonably clear on the evidence that Mr Tan returned to the apartment soon after 2.00 pm that day. Shortly thereafter, consistent with the jury’s verdict, the Offender attacked and murdered Mr Tan in the apartment. By that time, Mr Tay was already dead.  
     
      
    26 Evidence was given by Dr Duflou, pathologist, which touched upon the time of the initial attack on Mr Tay and the time of his death (T495-496, T503-504, T524-525). Dr Duflou referred to examinations conducted by Dr Rodriguez, neuropathologist. Examination of Mr Tay’s brain by Dr Rodriguez revealed the presence of the substance Beta AAP, which becomes visible after survival of Mr Tay for a period of between at least 30 minutes and about two hours. In this case, Dr Rodriguez was of the opinion that the substance became visible after about two hours, that is from the time when the head injuries were inflicted to him. I accept that Mr Tay survived for about two hours between the time he was struck to the head and the time of death. 
     
      
    27 Accordingly, I find that Mr Tay was attacked by the Offender with the softball bat shortly after midday on Monday, 15 September 2003. Mr Tay sustained two injuries to the head at that time. The first injury was a blunt-force injury and the second was a laceration to the back of the head. Dr Duflou testified that Mr Tay had died as a result of blunt-force head injury to the back of the head, and observed as well a stab wound to the neck and multiple superficial stab wounds to the forehead, and probably blunt-force defensive injuries to the left hand. The blunt-force injuries were consistent with having been caused by an object such as the softball bat.  
     
      
    28 The stab wound to the neck had minimal bleeding and this indicated that, when inflicted, Mr Tay was either very close to death or had died.  
     
      
    29 Dr Duflou stated that it was possible that a kitchen knife (Exhibit K) caused the stab wound to the neck. The kitchen knife came from the cutlery drawer in the kitchen of the apartment. 
     
      
    30 I note the finding of Adams J at [7] that it was very likely that, after the Offender had attacked Mr Tan, he checked whether Mr Tay was dead by pricking his forehead with the knife, and thinking that he was or might be still alive, he then stabbed him in the throat. Before me, the Crown submitted that the appropriate finding was that the Offender had stabbed Mr Tay in the neck shortly before Mr Tan returned to the apartment to ensure that Mr Tay was dead.  
     
      
    31 I note that forensic examination of the softball bat and the knife did not disclose any of Mr Tay’s blood on either object. The Crown contended that the Offender had washed the softball bat in the period following the attack upon Mr Tay and the return of Mr Tan to the apartment. The absence of Mr Tay’s blood on the knife did not sit comfortably with the Crown’s hypothesis that the Offender had stabbed Mr Tay shortly before Mr Tan’s return to the apartment, nor is it consistent with the view of Adams J that Mr Tay had been stabbed by the Offender after the murder of Mr Tan. I note that Mr Tan’s blood was detected on the knife and the softball bat. 
     
      
    32 There is no direct evidence as to events leading the Offender to viciously attack Mr Tay with the softball bat. The Crown contended that the attack on Mr Tay by the Offender was motivated by a dispute concerning the monies owing by the Offender to Mr Tay for past rent, and the Offender not taking over and making the lease payment on 13 September 2003, in the context of other financial pressures upon the Offender, including the requirement to pay University fees. At one level, it is difficult to understand how such a dispute could lead to an extremely violent and homicidal attack upon Mr Tay. On the other hand, I accept that the build up of financial pressure upon the Offender created a grievance between him and Mr Tay. Of course, there may have been other unknown factors which contributed to the attack on Mr Tay. For whatever reason, it was the Offender who savagely attacked and killed Mr Tay on 15 September 2003.  
     
      
    33 The jury was directed that there was no obligation upon the Crown to prove motive in the trial and that motive was not an element of the crime of murder (SU31). However, the jury was directed that motive can be an issue in the trial and that the presence or absence of motive, or the nature of the motive which is suggested, may bear upon a determination as to whether the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the Offender who killed Mr Tay and Mr Tan (SU31): De Gruchy v The Queen [2002] 211 CLR 85 at 92-93 [28]-[32]; R v Vjestica [2008] VSCA 47; 182 A Crim R 350 at 382-383 [112]-[115]. 
     
      
    34 The Crown submitted, and I accept, that the Offender left the body of Mr Tay behind a couch in the living room and positioned a chair at the end of the lounge to camouflage the presence of the body from Mr Tan when he arrived home. 
     
      
    35 The Crown acknowledged that it was not possible to determine whether the attack by the Offender on Mr Tay arose suddenly out of an argument between them that day, or whether there was premeditation. The Crown did not submit that the purchase of the softball bat two days earlier supported a finding that its criminal use upon Mr Tay was planned. I am not in a position to make a finding one way or the other. No finding of planning and premeditation adverse to the Offender can be made in these circumstances. Of course, that does not automatically lead to a finding that the attack was spontaneous. The Court is simply not in a position to make a finding either way on this aspect. 
     
      
    36 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Offender intended to kill Mr Tay at the time when he stabbed him in the neck. I am satisfied that the Offender intended, at the very least, to inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr Tay at the time of the initial attack with the softball bat. 
     
      
       
      The Murder of Mr Tan 
       
      
    37 Mr Tan arrived at the University at about 12.15 pm, a little late for his midday lecture. The lecture concluded early at about 1.50 pm. A number of witnesses observed Mr Tan at the University that afternoon, some noting that Mr Tay was not with him. Some also observed that Mr Tan appeared distracted, and he indicated to one witness that he would not be attending a session later that afternoon. After leaving the lecture hall, Mr Tan walked to the steps leading from the University to the corner of Willis Street and Oval Lane, Kingsford. This was a well-used pedestrian pathway to and from the University. He was observed by witnesses at the Willis Street steps shortly before 2.00 pm. He was seen to enter a vehicle parked in Willis Street near the steps. Other persons were in that vehicle. There were different descriptions of the vehicle by the two witnesses who testified on this aspect. Although it was a relatively short walk from the Willis Street steps to 109 Barker Street, Kingsford, I accept that Mr Tan was conveyed by vehicle to his residence that afternoon.  
     
      
    38 A defence argument at trial was that persons in that vehicle were involved in the murder of Mr Tan. The jury rejected that suggestion, and the associated suggestion that the same persons may have been involved in the earlier murder of Mr Tay. 
     
      
    39 I accept that Mr Tan was dropped at 109 Barker Street, Kingsford and that he walked up stairs and entered the apartment by the front door. If he had entered via the rear stairs, he would have immediately come across Mr Tay’s body on the lounge room floor, together with heavy areas of blood staining. 
     
      
    40 By this time, the Offender had determined that it would be necessary to kill Mr Tan on his return to the apartment. Having regard to the jury’s verdict, I accept the Crown submission that his motive for killing Mr Tan was to remove him as a witness who could harm the Offender with respect to the murder of Mr Tay. Of course, Mr Tan had not been present when Mr Tay was murdered. The attack upon Mr Tay had occurred some time prior to Mr Tan’s return to the apartment after 2.00 pm. However, I accept the Crown submission that the Offender perceived that Mr Tan was in a position to shed light upon the relationship between Mr Tay and the Offender, and the dispute between them, which may explain how the Offender would come to attack Mr Tay. Beyond that, the Crown submitted that the Offender had already determined to give an account to police and others of events whereby a stranger or strangers had killed Mr Tay, and that the murder of Mr Tan was necessary as well so that the Offender could thereby use the same explanation for the deaths of the two men.  
     
      
    41 I accept that the Offender had washed Mr Tay’s blood from the softball bat before the return of Mr Tan to the apartment. The likely explanation for the absence of Mr Tay’s blood on the knife was that the Offender had washed this as well following his use of the knife on Mr Tay, but that this use occurred in sufficient time before the return of Mr Tan to the apartment to allow the knife to be washed in this way. I note that the forensic examination of the apartment did not disclose any obvious signs of the washing of items to remove blood in the kitchen or bathroom. 
     
      
    42 The Crown submitted that Mr Tan entered the apartment by the front door and eventually entered the kitchen, where he commenced to cook chicken wings in a pot. Mr Tay’s body was on the lounge room floor, but the positioning of a chair would have rendered it difficult for a person to observe the body on entering the kitchen. 
     
      
    43 I accept that the attack upon Mr Tan commenced in the lounge room. The Offender wielded the softball bat which struck Mr Tan to the head and face. Blood stains and tooth fragments of Mr Tan support a finding that this was the location of the commencement of the attack upon Mr Tan. Dr Duflou determined that the direct cause of death of Mr Tan was the combined effect of blunt-force head injury and stab wounds to the neck. There were 10 wounds to Mr Tan’s head, two to the right ear, one to the left eye and one to the mouth. He received massive fracturing of the skull. Dr Duflou considered that the amount of force required to cause these head injuries would have been considerable over a period of time, involving multiple swings of the softball bat with significant force behind it. There were five knife wounds to Mr Tan’s neck. Because the two major knife wounds to the neck were very close together, Dr Duflou considered that it was likely that Mr Tan was unconscious, or was prevented from moving his head whilst these injuries were sustained. 
     
      
    44 Paint scrapings were taken from the eastern wall of the lounge room in the vicinity of Mr Tay’s blood, and from the western wall in the vicinity of Mr Tan’s blood. The softball bat was also examined for this purpose. A scientific examination of the three items (the paint scrapings from the two walls and the softball bat), revealed that traces on the three items were indistinguishable with respect to colour, fluorescence, infrared spectroscopy and pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry. This evidence pointed to one-way transfer from the softball bat to the two walls, producing dark marks on the walls. However, examination of the softball bat could not reveal a two-way transfer, namely presence of the wall paint on the softball bat. Nevertheless, the evidence of the one-way transfer, taken with the balance of the evidence, supported a conclusion that the softball bat had been used as the weapon which inflicted blunt-force head injuries to both Mr Tay and Mr Tan and I so find. The presence of Mr Tan’s blood on the bat fortifies this finding. 
     
      
    45 The forensic evidence, including the pattern of blood stains, points to the attack upon Mr Tan commencing in the lounge room with Mr Tan then fleeing down the hallway towards the front door, whilst being further attacked with the softball bat until he slumped in the corner at the front door where further blows were struck, and then finally the knife wounds inflicted to his neck. 
     
      
    46 The beating of Mr Tan was so savage that it exposed his brain and parts of the damaged skull penetrated his brain. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Offender intended to kill Mr Tan at the time of the attack upon him with the softball bat and knife. 
     
      
       
      Events After the Murders 
       
      
    47 The Offender made a ‘000’ call at 2.20 pm on 15 September 2003, which was terminated some 10 minutes and 27 seconds later. He advised the operator that his two friends were dead and when asked what had happened, the Offender replied “I have no idea. I was asleep and I heard this screaming, and I, when I turned my two friends are dead”. The Offender’s case at trial, arising from the content of the ‘000’ call and statements made by him to police in recorded interviews, was that he was asleep in his bedroom when Mr Tay was killed, and that he was woken by Mr Tan’s scream just prior to the murder of Mr Tan. He said that he did not emerge from his bedroom until after the attack on Mr Tan was completed and there was silence in the apartment. The Offender said that he emerged from his bedroom and approached Mr Tan, who was propped up on the floor near the front door. There was evidence before the jury from a number of persons that the Offender had a propensity to sleep in the afternoon. The verdicts of the jury, however, involve a rejection of the Offender’s account that he was sleeping at relevant times. 
     
      
    48 Observations of the Offender in the street after arrival of the ambulance and police revealed blood spots on his feet and forearms. Later examination revealed that this was Mr Tan’s blood. It was the evidence at trial that the blood spots on the Offender were consistent with either medium velocity impact spatter (deposited upon the Offender in the course of his attack upon Mr Tan) or expirated blood (deposited upon the Offender by a spontaneous cough reflex of Mr Tan whilst blood was deposited in his nose or airways). Given the competing explanations available for the presence of the blood, with one explanation being an innocent one, this aspect of the evidence was, on its own, inconclusive. I accept, however, that the jury considered the totality of the circumstantial evidence, leading to this feature being damaging to the Offender.  
     
      
    49 As I have mentioned, although Mr Tan’s blood was identified on the softball bat and the knife, it could not be demonstrated that Mr Tay’s blood was present on either object. At trial, the Crown observed that an area of the knife was positive for blood on a screening test, but could not provide a DNA analysis. In the end, it may be stated that there was direct and positive evidence of the presence of Mr Tan’s blood on each object, but no evidence of the presence of Mr Tay’s blood, although the forensic evidence did not entirely exclude that possibility. 
     
      
    50 By their verdicts, the jury rejected the exculpatory version of the Offender arising from the ‘000’ call, statements made in the street to police and ambulance officers, and in police interviews conducted with him on 15 September 2003, 18 September 2003 and 28 May 2004.  
     
      
    51 The Offender was arrested and charged with the murders on 28 May 2004, and has been in custody since that time. 
     
      
       
      The Offender’s Subjective Circumstances 
       
      
    52 No evidence was adduced in the sentencing proceedings before me concerning the Offender’s background. However, I was invited to proceed upon the basis of the findings made by Adams J at [16]ff, based upon an affidavit of the Offender’s father which was read in the sentencing proceedings before his Honour, without objection by the Crown. In addition, the evidence of the trial, including the Offender’s recorded interviews, revealed a good deal of information concerning his family background and circumstances. 
     
      
    53 As mentioned earlier, the Offender was born in 1979 and was 24 years of age at the time of the offences. He is now 32 years old. He was born in India, but moved to Singapore with his family when he was three years old. The family then moved to Brunei, where the Offender’s father obtained a job as a teacher. 
     
      
    54 The Offender’s father retired at the end of 2003 and returned to Singapore.  
     
      
    55 The Offender did exceedingly well at his high school studies, and qualified easily for A levels which placed him in the top 90%-95% of his cohort. He wished to undertake engineering studies, but such a course was not available at the University of Brunei and, in any event, when he finished his secondary education, he was required to perform national service in Singapore. 
     
      
    56 The Offender returned to Singapore in 1998 and entered national service in March of that year. He was selected for the officer cadet school and, in due course, was commissioned as a lieutenant. He volunteered for commando and ranger courses which he undertook, but less than successfully. 
     
      
    57 As mentioned earlier, the Offender gained admission to the University of New South Wales and was granted a training award by the Singapore Armed Forces, leaving Singapore for Sydney in July 2000. 
     
      
    58 Adams J found at [18] that the Offender was part of a strong, loving and supportive family. I am aware that some members of the Offender’s family travelled to Sydney to be present during parts of his recent trial. 
     
      
    59 The Offender has no criminal history and has been in custody since his arrest on 28 May 2004. 
     
      
       
      Impact Upon Families of Victims 
       
      
    60 No victim impact evidence was adduced in the sentencing proceedings. However, Mr Tan’s mother, Chiew Lee Hua, gave evidence in the trial (T397-403) and the effect upon her of the loss of her son was apparent. In addition, extracts from statements and interviews conducted by police with Mr Tay’s wife, Winnie Leong, and Mr Tan’s wife, Yokeharloi, were read before the jury.  
     
      
    61 Like Adams J at [20], I acknowledge the dreadful sense of loss suffered by the families of these two young men who were about to complete their studies in 2003, with very great distinction, with the expectation that they would return to their families in Singapore to live happy, prosperous and fulfilling lives. Instead, they were both cut down and beaten to death in savage murders which, on the evidence before the Court, could not relate in any way to the conduct of either of them. 
     
      
    62 In passing sentence, I keep in mind the principles in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 84-87 and R v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510 at 529-530. 
     
      
       
      Assessment of Sentences 
       
      
    63 The Crown submitted that the sentences imposed by Adams J were appropriate and that no good reason existed for imposing any lesser sentence for the murders committed by the Offender. As I have mentioned, Mr Dalton SC acknowledged that the sentences imposed by Adams J were not inappropriate for the person who committed these crimes, although fundamental to this submission was the Offender’s continuing denial that he had killed either man or was involved, in any way, in their murders. 
     
      
    64 The maximum penalty for murder is imprisonment for life: s.19A Crimes Act 1900. A standard non-parole period of 20 years applies for the crime of murder: s.54A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    65 Section 61 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides for a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment where a person is convicted of murder, and the Court is satisfied that the level of culpability and the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.  
     
      
    66 The Crown submitted that a determinate sentence ought be fixed for the murder of Mr Tay, but a life sentence ought be fixed for the murder of Mr Tan. 
     
      
    67 I accept that features which bear upon the objective seriousness of the murder of Mr Tay include the fact that the Offender was someone whom Mr Tay trusted, the fact that Mr Tay was murdered in his own home, that extreme force was used with the softball bat to Mr Tay’s head, that the Offender did not seek any medical help or intervene in any way on behalf of Mr Tay, but left him dying on the lounge room floor, that the Offender stabbed Mr Tay a considerable time (up to two hours) after the initial attack with the softball bat and that the likely motive for it was a financial benefit or, at least, the avoidance of a financial detriment. 
     
      
    68 Factors bearing upon the objective seriousness of the murder of Mr Tan include the fact that the Offender was a person whom Mr Tan trusted, that the Offender’s motive for the murder was to silence Mr Tan as a potential witness adverse to him with respect to the murder of Mr Tay, the extreme force used in the attack upon Mr Tan in the lounge room and hallway culminating in a savage and lethal attack using a combination of the softball bat and then the knife. 
     
      
    69 There was a significant time gap between the two murders, and a link between the two, in that the murder of Mr Tan was carried out with the Offender perceiving that it would assist and advance his position in explaining his murder of Mr Tay. 
     
      
    70 The Offender has shown no contrition or remorse for either crime.  
     
      
    71 The Offender’s subjective case, involving prior good character and the other positive features to which reference has been made, is entirely secondary to the grave objective seriousness of the crimes for which he has been convicted. 
     
      
    72 It is necessary for the Court to consider the question of the appropriate sentence for each crime separately.  
     
      
    73 For the murder of Mr Tay, Adams J imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 25 years and did not set a non-parole period. No doubt, his Honour took this course because of the life sentence imposed for the second murder.  
     
      
    74 The Crown acknowledged that the principles in R v Gilmore (1979) 1 A Crim R 416 would apply here so that, following a second trial, the Offender should ordinarily not receive a longer sentence or non-parole period than those imposed in the first trial. I accept that this principle has application. 
     
      
    75 In my view, the murder of Mr Tay lies close to the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I see no foundation for a finding of “special circumstances” so that the ratio in s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ought stand. I propose to fix a sentence of imprisonment of 25 years, commencing on 28 May 2004 for the murder of Mr Tay, with a non-parole period of 18 years and three months to date from 28 May 2004.  
     
      
    76 I turn to the sentence to be passed for the murder of Mr Tan. 
     
      
    77 The burden of proving that a case falls within s.61(1) rests on the Crown, and the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt: R v Merritt (2004) 59 NSWLR 557 at 567 [35]. The primary focus of the legislation is directed towards an assessment of extreme culpability.  
     
      
    78 A life sentence is required if the culpability is so extreme that the community interest (in the combined effect of such of the factors of retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence as are applicable) could only be met by a life sentence: R v Merritt at 568 [42], 570 [54]. 
     
      
    79 If a life sentence is imposed in this State, it means a sentence for the term of the person’s natural life: s.19A(2). It is not open to the Court to set a non-parole period and there is no prospect of release, save for the prerogative of mercy: R v Harris (2000) 50 NSWLR 409 at 429 [122]-[125]. 
     
      
    80 I am conscious that it is an incorrect approach to sentencing to compare the facts of the case at hand with other cases in order to determine whether it does, or does not, fall within the worst case category, deserving of the maximum sentence: R v Merritt at 575 [65]. 
     
      
    81 However, I have considered other sentencing cases in this State where a person has been sentenced for multiple murders. I have taken this course to identify the application of relevant sentencing principles in those cases, rather than by way of a factual comparison to inform a decision as to whether the murder of Mr Tan falls within s.61 of the Act.  
     
      
    82 In R v Mehta [2009] NSWSC 814, Grove J imposed a sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment for the first murder and life imprisonment for the second murder, where an offender had pleaded guilty to the two crimes. The offender had murdered his partner, and then a nine-year old child who had witnessed him strangling the child’s mother. His Honour found that the mother had been killed for a financial motive and an entirely different and subsequently formed motive, namely to silence a possible witness to murder, inspired the offender to kill the child. There was nothing mitigating in the closeness in time between the two murders. Grove J found at [41]-[42] that the murder of the child fell into the worst category of that crime, and that a sentence of life imprisonment was appropriate given its heinousness. His Honour observed at [49] that the requirements of s.61 Crimes (Sentencing Proceedings)1999 had been demonstrated with respect to the murder of the child. 
     
      
    83 In Ta’ala v R [2008] NSWCCA 132, the Court of Criminal Appeal considered a sentence appeal where an offender had pleaded guilty to two counts of murder committed on the same day, where the second killing was designed to prevent the report to the police of the first murder. Determinate sentences were imposed, giving rise to a total overall sentence of imprisonment for 47 years with a non-parole period of 38 years and six months. Although the sentencing Judge had assessed the second murder as falling within s.61, a determinate sentence was fixed for it, in the exercise of discretion. There was no Crown appeal in that case. The appeal was allowed in part to cure a mathematical error which had occurred in the sentencing process. The total effective sentence was one of 47 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 35 years. 
     
      
    84 I have considered other cases in which an offender has been given determinate sentences for multiple killings, including De Gruchy v The Queen, above, and R v Hill [2003] NSWCCA 128. 
     
      
    85 I am faced with the position in this case where the Crown submits that a finding of Adams J that the murder of Mr Tan was in the worst-case category ought be adopted, and where Mr Dalton SC acknowledges that this approach is not inappropriate for the murder of Mr Tan.  
     
      
    86 It remains a matter for me to make a finding as to whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that s.61 applies, so that the maximum penalty should be imposed for the murder of Mr Tan. 
     
      
    87 An assessment of the heinousness of the murder of Mr Tan involves consideration of the following matters, arising from the verdicts of the jury: 
     
      
       
      (a) there was a significant time gap, up to two hours, between the attack upon Mr Tay and the attack on Mr Tan - there was a significant opportunity for the Offender to consider his position, and the course which he set upon was the murder of Mr Tan to protect his own interests, in light of his crime against Mr Tay; 
       
       
      (b) both attacks were brutal and savage, and the repetition, with even more violence, in the attack upon Mr Tan, using the softball bat and the knife, elevates the gravity of what is already a most serious crime - the earlier murder may be taken into account in assessing the Offender’s culpability for the later murder:  
      R v Merritt  
      at 568 [40]; 
       
       
      (c) the Courts have recognised that the murder of a person to remove that person as a witness to another crime is a gravely serious feature, which can elevate the second crime into the class of heinousness which attracts s.61(1); 
       
       
      (d) this was not a spontaneous act by the Offender, immediately deciding to kill Mr Tan who had just witnessed the murder of Mr Tay - rather, the evidence in the trial, and the verdicts of the jury, lead to the unavoidable conclusion that this was an execution of Mr Tan to assist the Offender in what he perceived to be his own defence against the allegation that he had murdered Mr Tay:  
      R v Villa 
       [2005] NSWCCA 4 at [87]. 
       
      
    88 I have given careful consideration to the question whether a life sentence should be imposed upon the Offender for the murder of Mr Tan. I can only take that course if I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the requirements of s.61 have been met, so as to warrant imposition of the maximum penalty. Having assessed the factors which bear upon that decision, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this case meets the requirements of s.61. The murder of Mr Tan was a very grave crime, and this will be reflected in the lengthy determinate sentence to be imposed. However, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the maximum sentence should be imposed in this case.  
     
      
    89 I have given anxious consideration before reaching this conclusion, which differs from that reached by Adams J. 
     
      
    90 It is necessary to fix a sentence for the murder of Mr Tan. The objective seriousness of this crime lies well above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. It lies close to, but not at, the point where a life sentence ought be imposed. There is no practical ceiling to the non-parole period which ought be set by reference to observations made in R v Folbigg (2005) 152 A Crim R 35: Ta’ala v R at [39]-[43]. I am satisfied that a non-parole period of 30 years should be fixed, with a balance of term of 10 years. I do not find “special circumstances” so as to vary the ratio under s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    91 Having determined an appropriate sentence for each offence, I must consider questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality. The total effective sentence must represent a proper period of incarceration for the totality of the criminality involved: R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [70]; R v Knight (2005) 155 A Crim R 252 at 272 [112]. 
     
      
    92 There must be a significant level of accumulation, having regard to the fact that two murders were committed, with the latter having additional aggravating factors surrounding it. Although there was a link between the two murders which were, in a sense, part of a course of criminal conduct on the afternoon of 15 September 2003, there must be a significant level of accumulation to reflect the commission of two separate murders, involving differing levels of criminality. 
     
      
    93 I will direct that the sentence for the murder of Mr Tan should commence on 28 May 2012. As a result, the total effective sentence will involve a head sentence of 48 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 38 years, expiring on 28 May 2042. 
     
      
    94 Will the Offender please stand. Ram Puneet Tiwary: 
     
      
       
      (a) for the murder of Chow Lyang Tay, I sentence you to imprisonment for a period of 25 years comprising a non-parole period of 18 years and three months commencing on 28 May 2004 and expiring on 27 August 2022 with a balance of term of six years and nine months commencing on 28 August 2022 and expiring on 27 May 2029; 
       
       
      (b) for the murder of Poh Chuan Tan, I sentence you to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 30 years commencing on 28 May 2012 and expiring on 27 May 2042, with a balance of term of 10 years commencing on 28 May 2042 and expiring on 27 May 2052; 
       
       
      (c) the earliest date upon which you will be eligible for parole is 28 May 2042.
