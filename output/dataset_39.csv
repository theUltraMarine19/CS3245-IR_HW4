ORAL JUDGMENT
Francis Tan Meng Chiang is a director. The business of the defendants is to manufacture gold jewellery and diamond jewellery. Francis became a director in 1978. Before 1978, he was aware that his father had business transactions with the plaintiff who was a broker when his father managed the family business. With the passage of time, Francis came to know the plaintiff through the dealings his father had with the plaintiff.
The plaintiff, although he was a broker with the defendants' company, was also permitted to take jewellery to sell to other customers. When jewellery was taken for sale, sometimes up to the value of $40,000, all that the plaintiff had to do was to sign a consignment note. The plaintiff was a trusted broker of the defendants' company of many years' standing. Where jewellery was taken and remained unsold, it was always properly returned.
After 1981, Francis got to know the plaintiff personally. The plaintiff would contact him over the telephone and talked about commission and the like without difficulty. The plaintiff introduced many individual clients to the defendants' company for which commission was paid.
When a lot of Arab customers started to come from the Middle East, Francis asked the plaintiff, who speaks Arabic, to introduce him to the plaintiff's customers. Francis wanted customers introduced who would not only buy but also design items of jewellery from the defendants' company. The plaintiff's part was to introduce customers. Where there was purchase and payment for goods purchased, commission would be paid at the agreed rate.
The commission as promised by Francis was for as long as customers were brought to the defendants' company. All that the customers were expected to do was to purchase the jewellery from the defendants' company. The commission was paid when introduction took place and the agreement that existed, was, according to the plaintiff, that once a customer had been introduced, commission would be paid for every subsequent purchase. The defendants had a slightly different version, but it goes to details that can wait.
On 17 April 1984, the parties entered into an agreement which was reduced into writing. This is the subject of the claim. The terms of the letter of undertaking under the Defendants' letterhead is as follows:
Letter of Undertaking This is to confirm that we shall pay a commission of ten (10) cents Singapore per gram for any purchases of 21K gold jewellery effested (sic) by M/S AL6Romaizan (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd of No. 5 Shenton Way, #29-08, UIC Building, Singapore 0105 to M/S Hassan Bin Omar Alkhatib, I/C No 0633764/C of 723 North Bridge Road, Singapore 0719
JUMBO CRAFTS (PTE) LTD
Signed Director
Dated this 17/4/84
Under this agreement, the defendants paid $75,487.75 commission over the period 5 March 1984 to 27 May 1985 to the plaintiff. Prior to this contract, the defendants had not paid commission to the plaintiff at the rate of S10 per gram. Previously the commission was normally paid where there were individual purchases at the rate of 2% to 5%. There was also some dispute over the currency, but that need not detain us.
Before the agreement was signed, a meeting took place in the defendants' premises sometime in February or March 1984 after the plaintiff had had a telephone conversation with Francis. The meeting took place one or two weeks after the telephone conversation. The persons who arrived at the defendants' premises were the plaintiff, Lotfi (the General Manager) and one Lajam who is the son-in-law of the plaintiff who is related to Lotfi. The plaintiff took Lotfi and Lajam up to the reception desk in the defendants' company and there introduced Lotfi and Lajam to Francis, saying that Lotfi, and referring to Lajam as Faisal, are from Al-Romaizan. According to the defendants, nothing more was said and the plaintiff then left. According to the plaintiff, he stayed for the duration of the meeting but that he was a listener. The meeting took place in the conference room and lasted about thirty minutes. I accept the plaintiff's version.
The defendants' case is that the letter of 17 April 1984 does not contain the full terms and conditions for the payment of the commission.
In the alternative, the defendants say that it was an implied term and/or condition and/or to be inferred from the letter of 17 April 1984 that the alleged commission is payable on:
(a) the plaintiff at material times being able to procure the custom of M/s Al-Romaizan (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd (hereinafter referred to as ""Al-Romaizan"") to make the purchase of the said gold jewellery from the defendants; (b) the plaintiff at all material times being able to get and/or ensure that payment by the said Al-Romaizan would be prompt without having the defendants to chase for payment; and (c) the plaintiff being the effective cause of the purchase of the said gold jewellery from the defendants.
The defendants say that in order to induce the defendants to sign the letter of 17 April 1984, the plaintiff represented to the defendants:
(a) that at all material times the plaintiff was able to procure the custom of the said Al-Romaizan to purchase the said gold jewellery from the defendants; and
(b) that at all material times the plaintiff would be able to ensure that the payment for the purchase of the said gold jewellery by the said Al-Romaizan would be prompt.
The said representations, it has been pleaded, were made by and are to be inferred from:
(a) the letter of 17 April 1984; and (b)oral statements made by the plaintiff to the defendants prior to 17 April 1984 notwithstanding the fact that it is also the defendants' evidence that the plaintiff did no more than introduce the parties when they were first introduced, and left them together when he is supposed to have made false representations to Francis about the many things he could do.
The defendants say that acting on the faith and truth of the representations and induced thereby the defendants signed the letter dated 17 April 1984 and paid to the plaintiff money totalling $75,487.75. The defendants also say that the plaintiff made representations fraudulently knowing that they were false and untrue or recklessly not caring whether they were true or false. The defendants also rely on the provisions of s 2 of the Misrepresentation Act, 1967 as entitling the defendants to the relief claimed in their defence and counterclaim. The defendants say that when the defendants discovered that the said representations were untrue, the defendants rescinded the contract. The solicitor's letter dated 11 September 1985 was sent terminating the letter of undertaking dated 17 April 1984. The solicitor's letter, no doubt, written after instructions were given is as follows:
Our Ref: TKM/Misc/85

MR Hassan Bin Omar Alkhatib 723 North Bridge Road Singapore 0719

Yours faithfully
Signed.
cc. client.
The letter of 11 September 1985, however, does not make any reference to the fact that the agreement set out in the letter dated 17 April 1984 does not contain the full terms, that the defendants were induced by misrepresentations made by the plaintiff and money paid was due to them. The letter does not make any reference to representations being made fraudulently or that the defendants will rely upon s 2 of the Misrepresentation Act.
The defendants also say that on a proper construction of the letter of 17 April 1984, the defendants are not an accounting party to the plaintiff or in any way accountable to the plaintiff and if the defendants should be an accounting party, the commission rate is not as alleged in the statement of claim.
The defendants say that the plaintiff, if at all, is entitled to a commission at the rate of S5 per gram for the purchase of 21K gold jewellery by the said Al-Romaizan as agreed subsequently with effect from 12 January 1985, a change brought about by a reduction in workmanship fees. Payment was made to the plaintiff from 12 January 1985 to 27 May 1985 based on the new rate of 5 per gram. There is a dispute as to whether the plaintiff had accepted the change. The fact remains that the plaintiff was supplied with copies of documents from which the change could be inferred.
This is a case where the relationship of the parties goes back a considerable period. The trust that existed between the plaintiff and the defendants was a very special one. The relationship that the plaintiff had with the father and the trust and confidence he had with the father, was, in a manner of speaking, inherited and accepted by Francis, and reciprocated by the plaintiff.
Francis asked the plaintiff to introduce customers from Trengganu and Brunei to the defendants' company by bringing them to the shop. Rightly or wrongly, the plaintiff began to suspect that the commission he was paid without default in the past was not being paid properly. He had good reason to want to put the agreement into writing. Al-Romaizan was not an ordinary customer. The transactions were different. The estimated sales, looking at 40 kilos per month, is in the region of $1.632 million dollars.
The letter of undertaking is clear. The object sought to be achieved in construing any contract is to ascertain what the mutual intentions of the parties were as to the legal obligations each assumed by the contractual words in which they sought to express them. What must be ascertained is to be taken as the intention which reasonable people would have had if placed in the situation of the parties. See Reardon-Smith Line Ltd v Hansen-Tangen < 1976 > 1 WLR 989. A similar point was made in McCutcheon v David MacBrayne Ltd < 1964 > 1 WLR 125 where Lord Reid said:
The judicial task is not to discover the actual intentions of each party, it is to decide what each was reasonably entitled to conclude from the attitude of the other.
In Codefa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales (1982) 149 CLR 337, Mason J said:
... when the issue is which of two or more possible meanings is to be given to a contractual provision we look not to the actual intentions, aspirations or expectations of the parties before or at the time of the contract, except in so far as they are expressed in the contract, but to the objective framework of facts within which the contract came into existence, and to the parties' presumed intention in this setting. We do not take into account the actual intentions of the parties and for the very good reason that an investigation of those matters would not only be time consuming but would also be unrewarding as it would tend to give too much weight to these factors at the expense of the actual language of the contract.
Sir John Donaldson M R explained the unimportance of the actual intentions of the parties in Summit Investment Inc v British Steel Corporation < 1987 > l Lloyds' Rep. 230 at 233:
their actual intentions are happily irrelevant, since, were it otherwise, many, and perhaps most, disputes upon points of construction would be resolved by holding that the parties were not ad idem.
For the purpose of construing the contract before me, the intention of the parties is in the meaning of the words they have used. There is no intention independent of that meaning. I must ascertain the intention from the language they have used in the light of the surrounding circumstances and the object of the contract in so far as that had been agreed and proved.
The letter of 17 April 1984 was first put up as a draft at the defendants' request. The letter was typed at the defendants' office after he had made amendments. The defendants signed it and made payments on it.
In Leggott v Barrett (1880) 15 Ch D 306, Brett LJ said:
... where there is a preliminary contract in words which is afterwards reduced into writing, or where there is a preliminary contract in writing which is afterwards reduced into a deed, the rights of the parties are governed in the first case entirely by the writing, and in the second case entirely by the deed; and if there be any difference between the words and the written document in the first case, or between the written agreement and the deed in the other case, the rights of the parties are entirely governed by the superior document and by the governing part of that document.
There is a dispute as to whether the contract is wholly in writing. I find the contract is wholly in writing. Where a contract is made wholly in writing, evidence is not admissible to add to, vary or contradict the written terms unless there is fraud. I find no fraud. The plaintiff had a son-in-law working for Al-Romaizan. The son-in-law is related to the General Manager, Lotfi. The undisputed facts are that Francis was told that the General Manager would be coming to the defendants' premises when Francis, after his 1981 trip to Saudi Arabia, wanted to do business with Al-Romaizan. The plaintiff introduced Al-Romaizan to the defendants.
The court in construing any written agreement is entitled to look at evidence of the objective factual document known to the parties at or before the date of the contract and objectively the aim of the transaction. But this does not entitle the court to look at the evidence of the parties subjective intentions.
The workmanship fees per gram for Al-Romaizan was US$1 in 1983 and steadily went down to US70 whereas the commission of the plaintiff remained constant. The defendants' relationship with the General Manager became closer. Playing up to him would make all the difference. It is not surprising that the defendants found themselves in a difficult position when Al-Romaizan applied pressure to reduce workmanship fees. A need to wriggle out of a bad bargain existed. The relationship with Lotfi promised a way out.
Workmanship Fees Per Gram For Al-Romaizan Dates Workmanship Per Gram 1983 - 31.10.84 US$1.00 1.11.84 - 28.11.84 US$0.90 22.1.85 - 28.6.85 US$0.87 24.7.85 - 16.9.85 US$0.83 14.10.85 - 30.5.86 US$0.80 2.9.86 - 3.3.87 US$0.77 5.3.87 - 4.6.88 US$0.70
Al-Romaizan was a big customer, but it is clear from the evidence of Lotfi that he also drove a hard bargain. What at first appeared as a profitable arrangement, with time, became less and less profitable.
It is in the above context that Francis reduced the rate of commission from 10"" to 5"". The plaintiff denies there was such an agreement. The documentary evidence, however, makes it clear that the commission was being paid at 5 per gram. The evidence of Lotfi Ababaker Abdullah and Francis on some matters are not satisfactory. Francis had no answer to an important question. I will say no more at this stage and will give fuller grounds for my decision at a later stage, if that should become necessary. The recission of the contract of 17 April 1984 by the defendants is not valid.
I make the following orders: 
(1) There will be an order for the following accounts to be taken, that is to say: (a) an account to be taken of all sales effected by the defendants to M/s Al-Romaizan (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd and of the amount of commission due thereon to the plaintiff on the sales effected; (b) an account to be taken of the commission due to the plaintiff at the rate of: (i) S10"" per gram for all purchases of 21K gold jewellery from 17 April 1984 up to 12 January 1985; and (ii) thereafter at S5"" per gram for all purchases of 21K gold jewellery effected by M/s Al- Romaizon (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd. 
(2) Defendants to pay the plaintiffs all sums due to the plaintiff by way of commission on the accounts taken.
(3) Interest on the commission from due date of the commission at 6%.
(4) Costs. 
(5) The defendants' counterclaim is dismissed with costs. 
(6) By consent, decision in this suit determines the rights and claims of the parties in Suit No 1379/86.",1992-04-29 00:00:00,SG High Court
